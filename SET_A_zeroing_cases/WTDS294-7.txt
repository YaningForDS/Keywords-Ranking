UNITED STATES ­ LAWS, REGULATIONS AND METHODOLOGY FOR CALCULATING DUMPING MARGINS ("ZEROING")
Request for the Establishment of a Panel by the European Communities
The following communication, dated 5 February 2004, from the delegation of the European Commission to the Chairman of the Dispute Settlement Body, is circulated pursuant to Article 6.2 of the DSU.
_______________

On 12 June 2003 and 8 September 2003, the European Communities requested consultations with the United States of America (the "United States") under Article 4 of the Understanding on Rules and Procedures Governing the Settlement of Disputes (the "DSU"); Article XXII:1 of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994 (the "GATT 1994"); and Articles 17.2 and 17.3 of the Agreement on implementation of Article VI of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994 (the "AD Agreement") with regard to the laws, regulations and methodologies for calculating dumping margins including zeroing practices1. Consultations were held on 17 July 2003 and 6 October 2003. They have allowed a better understanding of the respective positions of the parties, but have not led to a satisfactory resolution of the matter.
Summary of facts
In anti-dumping proceedings the United States uses the following methodologies to establish the dumping margin.
In original investigations, the United States identifies sub-groups of products within the product under investigation ("averaging groups") on a per model basis as well as on the basis of other criteria such as the level of trade. Within each of the averaging groups, a weighted average export price is established and compared to the corresponding weighted average normal value. The results of these comparisons on an "averaging group" basis are added up to establish the dumping margin of the product under investigation as a whole; however, in this process, any negative margins or amounts of "dumping" resulting from the comparison of weighted average normal values with weighted average export prices on an "averaging group" basis are put at zero. As a result, the United States calculates a margin and amount of dumping in excess of the actual dumping practised by the companies concerned.
In administrative review investigations, the United States determines the margin of dumping on the basis of a comparison of a weighted average normal value for each "averaging group" and individual export prices (the United States does not establish weighted average export prices in administrative review investigations). Here again, when adding up the results of the comparisons to determine the total amount or margin of dumping of the product under investigation, the United States puts at zero any negative amounts of "dumping". As a result, the United States calculates a margin of

WT/DS294/7 Page 2
dumping and collects an amount of anti-dumping duty in excess of the actual dumping practised by the companies concerned. The United States uses this methodology systematically in all reviews including so-called newcomer review investigations (Article 9.5 of the AD Agreement), changed circumstances review investigations (Article 11.2 of the AD Agreement) and sunset review investigations (Article 11.3 of the AD Agreement).
These calculation methodologies are applied pursuant, in particular, to the following United States laws, regulations, administrative procedures and measures:
­ the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the "Act"), including the Statement of Administrative Action (the "SAA"), in particular Title VII and sections 731, 751, 771(35)(A), 771(35)(B) and 777(A)(d);
­ the implementing regulation2 of the United States Department of Commerce (the "DOC"), in particular section 351.414(c)(2); and
­ the Import Administration Antidumping Manual (1997 edition) (the "IA AD Manual") including the computer program(s) to which it refers.
The calculation methodologies described above were respectively applied in the determinations of dumping by the DOC in the original investigations listed in annex I and in the final results of the anti-dumping administrative review investigations listed in annex II.
Claims
­ As such claims
The European Communities considers that the above-mentioned United States laws, regulations, administrative procedures, measures and methodologies for determining the dumping margin in original investigations and review investigations are inconsistent with several provisions of the AD Agreement, GATT 1994 and the Marrakesh Agreement establishing the World Trade Organization , for the following reasons:
(a) in original investigations, the United States puts at zero the negative margins or amounts of "dumping" resulting from the comparison of weighted average normal values with weighted average export prices within the averaging groups. As a result, the United States calculates a margin and amount of dumping in excess of the actual dumping practised by the companies concerned. This constitutes a violation of:
· Articles 2.43 and 2.4.24 of the AD Agreement insofar as the comparison made by the United States is inconsistent with those provisions;
2 19 CFR Section 351. 3 "A fair comparison shall be made between the export price and the normal value ." 4 "Subject to the provisions governing fair comparison in paragraph 4, the existence of margins of dumping during the investigation phase shall normally be established on the basis of a comparison of a weighted average normal value with a weighted average of prices of all comparable export transactions or by a comparison of normal value and export prices on a transaction-to-transaction basis. A normal value established on a weighted average basis may be compared to prices of individual export transactions if the authorities find a pattern of export prices which differ significantly among different purchasers, regions or time periods, and if an explanation is provided as to why such differences cannot be taken into account appropriately by the use of a weighted average-to-weighted average or transaction-to-transaction comparison."

WT/DS294/7 Page 3
· Article 5.8 of the AD Agreement insofar as a de minimis dumping margin is erroneously determined to be not de minimis;
· Articles 9.1 and 9.3 of the AD Agreement insofar as there is as a result the imposition and collection of an anti-dumping duty in excess of the margin or amount of dumping as determined pursuant to Article 2 of the AD Agreement;
· Articles 1 and 2.1 of the AD Agreement and Articles VI:1 and VI:2 of the GATT 1994 insofar as there is as a result the imposition and collection of an anti-dumping duty which is inconsistent with the AD Agreement; and consequently of
· Article XVI:4 of the Marrakesh Agreement establishing the World Trade Organization and Article 18.4 of the AD Agreement insofar as the United States has not taken all necessary steps, of a general or particular character, to ensure the conformity of its laws, regulations and administrative procedures with the provisions of GATT 1994 and the AD Agreement.
(b) in review investigations, the United States systematically determines the margin of dumping on the basis of a comparison of a weighted average normal value and individual export prices and puts at zero the negative amounts of "dumping". As a result, the United States calculates a margin of dumping and collects an amount of anti-dumping duty in excess of the actual dumping practised by the companies concerned. This constitutes a violation of:
· Articles 2.4 and 2.4.2 of the AD Agreement5 insofar as the comparison made by the United States is inconsistent with those provisions;
· Articles 9.1 and 9.3 of the AD Agreement insofar as there is as a result the imposition and collection of an anti-dumping duty in excess of the margin of dumping determined pursuant to Article 2 of the AD Agreement;
· Articles 9.5 and 11 (including Articles 11.2 and 11.3) of the AD Agreement insofar as the determinations of dumping in review investigations contemplated by these provisions are not made in compliance with Articles 2.4 and 2.4.2 of the AD Agreement;
· Articles 1 and 2.1 of the AD Agreement and Articles VI:1 and VI:2 of the GATT 1994 insofar as there is as a result the imposition and collection of an anti-dumping duty which is inconsistent with the AD Agreement; and consequently of
· Article XVI:4 of the Marrakesh Agreement establishing the World Trade Organization and Article 18.4 of the AD Agreement insofar as the United States has not taken all necessary steps, of a general or particular character, to ensure the conformity of its laws, regulations and administrative procedures with the provisions of GATT 1994 and the AD Agreement.
As applied claims
In the specific anti-dumping proceedings annexed to the present request, the United States applied the methodologies and the laws, regulations, administrative procedures and measures described under point 2 above. In consequence, the European Communities considers that the determinations of dumping by DOC, the determinations of injury by the United States International

WT/DS294/7 Page 4
Trade Commission, the imposition of definitive duties in the original investigations and the outcome of the administrative review investigations as detailed in the annexes are inconsistent with the AD Agreement, GATT 1994 and the Marrakesh Agreement establishing the World Trade Organization as follows:
(a) in the original investigations:
· Articles 1, 2.1, 2.4, 2.4.2, 5.8, 9.1 and 9.3 of the AD Agreement and Articles VI:1 and VI:2 of the GATT 1994, for the reasons set out under point 3.1(a) above;
· Article 3, including Articles 3.1, 3.2 and 3.5, of the AD Agreement insofar as the volume of "dumped imports" for the injury and causality determinations is determined on the basis of margins of dumping in excess of the actual margin of dumping of the companies concerned, with the result that imports from certain companies which should be excluded because of de minimis dumping margins are erroneously included in the "dumped imports"; and consequently
· Article XVI:4 of the Marrakesh Agreement establishing the World Trade Organization and Article 18.4 of the AD Agreement, for the reasons set out under point 3.1(a) above.
(b) in the administrative review investigations : Articles 1, 2.1 2.4, 2.4.2, 9.1, 9.3, and 11 (including Article 11.2) of the AD Agreement and Articles VI:1 and VI:2 of the GATT 1994, and consequently Article XVI:4 of the Marrakesh Agreement establishing the World Trade Organization and Article 18.4 of the AD Agreement, for the reasons set out under point 3.1(b) above.
The European Communities hereby respectfully requests that a panel be established, with standard terms of reference, by the Dispute Settlement Body pursuant to Articles 4.7 and 6 of the DSU, Article XXIII of GATT 1994, and Article 17.4 the AD Agreement. The European Communities asks that this request be placed on the agenda of the meeting of the Dispute Settlement Body on 17 February 2004.
