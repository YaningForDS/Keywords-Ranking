UNITED STATES ­ LAWS, REGULATIONS AND METHODOLOGY FOR CALCULATING DUMPING MARGINS ("ZEROING")
Request for Consultations by the European Communities
The following communication, dated 12 June 2003, from the Permanent Delegation of the European Commission to the Permanent Mission of the United States and to the Chairman of the Dispute Settlement Body, is circulated in accordance with Article 4.4 of the DSU.
_______________
On behalf of the European Communities (the "EC"), I hereby request consultations with the United States of America pursuant to Article 4 of the Understanding on Rules and Procedures Governing the Settlement of Disputes, Article XXII:1 of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994 (the "GATT") and Article 17 of the Agreement on implementation of Article VI of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994 (the "ADA").
This request is with respect to:
­ the Tariff Act of 1930 (the "Act"), in particular sections 751, 771(35)(A) and 771(35)(B),
­ the implementing regulation1 of the United States Department of Commerce (the "DOC"), in particular section 351.414(c)(2),

1 19 CFR Section 351.

WT/DS294/R Page A-3
­ the methodology of the DOC for determining the dumping margin in new investigations on the basis of the comparison of a weighted average normal value with a weighted average export price,
­ the methodology of the DOC for determining the dumping margin in reviews,
­ the determinations of dumping by the DOC, the determination of injury by the United States International Trade Commission and the DOC notice for the imposition of the anti-dumping duty in the cases listed in Annex I,
­ and the final results of the anti-dumping administrative reviews listed in Annex II.
The matters, which the EC would like to raise in the course of the consultations include, but are not limited to, the following:
(1) in new investigations, the zeroing of negative dumping margins when comparing export prices and normal values on a weighted average to weighted average basis;
(2) in reviews, the comparison of export prices and normal values on a weighted average to transaction basis and the zeroing of negative dumping margins in circumstances other than those specified in Article 2.4.2 of the ADA;
(3) the impact of zeroing negative dumping margins in the determination of the "dumped imports" in the injury investigation;
(4) the determination of dumping margins above de minimis level as a result of zeroing negative dumping margins and the consequent imposition, continuation or collection of an antidumping duty;
(5) the level of the dumping margins in the absence of zeroing in the cases listed in Annex I and Annex II
The EC is concerned that the Act, related regulations, US methodologies and determinations in the listed cases appear to be, in several respects, not in conformity with the obligations of the United States under the GATT, and the ADA, in particular under:
­ Articles 1, 2.4 (including 2.4.2), 3, 5.8, 9.3, 9.5, 11 and 18.3 of the ADA,
­ Articles VI:1 and VI:2 of the GATT,
­ Article XVI:4 of the Marrakech Agreement establishing the WTO and Article 18.4 of the ADA.
We reserve the right to raise additional claims and legal matters regarding the legislation and practice during the course of the consultations.
We look forward to receiving your reply to this request to setting a mutually convenient date for these consultations.

United States ­ Anti-Dumping duties on Imports of Certain Hot-Rolled Carbon Steel Flat Products from the Netherlands
Specific Case No. l
The measure
This case concerns the imposition of anti-dumping duties on Certain Hot-Rolled Carbon Steel Flat products from the Netherlands (US case number A-421-807, 66 FR 59565 of 29 November 2001). The rate of the ad valorem anti-dumping duty was 2.59% for Corus Staal BV and all others.
Use of zeroing
In the United States Department of Commerce's investigation of Hot-Rolled Carbon Steel Flat Products from the Netherlands ("Hot-Rolled Steel"), the Department of Commerce (DOC) utilised a methodology commonly referred to as "zeroing".
The practice of "zeroing", as applied in this case by the DOC, can briefly be described as follows.
First, the DOC identified a number of different "models" or "types" of Hot-Rolled Steel, called connums.
Next, the DOC calculated, for each of these models, a weighted average normal value and a weighted average export price. Then, the DOC compared the weighted average normal value with the weighted average export price for each model. For some models, normal value was higher than export price; by subtracting export price from normal value for these models, the DOC established a "positive dumping margin" for each model. For other models, normal value was lower than export price; by subtracting export price from normal value for these other models, DOC established a "negative dumping margin" for each model. Thus, there is a "positive dumping margin" where there is dumping, and a "negative dumping margin" where there is not. The "positives" and "negatives" of the amounts in this calculation are an indication of precisely how much the export price is above or below the normal value.
Having made this calculation, the DOC then added up the amounts it had calculated as "dumping margins" for each model of the product in order to determine an overall dumping margin for the product as a whole. However, in doing so, the DOC treated any "negative dumping margin" as zero ­ hence the use of the word "zeroing". Then, finally, having added up the "positive dumping margins" and the zeroes, the DOC divided this sum by the cumulative total value of all the export transactions involving all types and models of that product. In this way, the DOC obtained an overall margin of dumping for the product under investigation.
This methodology is identical to the methodology that was held in breach of the WTO Anti-Dumping Agreement in European Communities - Anti-Dumping Duties on Imports of CottonType Bed Linen from India, (Panel Report, WT/DS141/R and Appellate Body Report, WT/DS141/AB/R, adopted 12 March 2001).
Dumping margin without zeroing
By using the above methodology, DOC calculated a dumping margin of 2.59% while without the zeroing methodology (i.e. with the negative unit margins included), the dumping margin would have been [- ..%] (negative) and the case would have been terminated.

Specific Case No. 3
The measure
This case concerns the imposition of anti-dumping duties on Stainless Steel Bar from Germany (US case number A-428-830, 67 FR 10382 of 7 March 2002). The rates of the ad valorem anti-dumping duty were 13.63% for BGH, 4.17% for Einsal, 15.40% for EWK, 32.32% for KEP and 16.96% for all others.
Use of zeroing
In the United States Department of Commerce's investigation of Stainless Steel Bar from Germany , the Department of Commerce (DOC) utilised the same "zeroing" methodology as described under Specific Case No. 1.
Dumping margin without zeroing
In particular, by using the above methodology, DOC calculated a dumping margin:
­ of 13.63% for BGH. Without the zeroing methodology (i.e. with the negative unit margins included), the dumping margin would have been [..%] (lower).
­ of 4.17% for Einsal. Without the zeroing methodology, the dumping margin would have been of [..%] (de minimis) and the case would have been terminated with respect to this exporter.

United States ­ Anti-Dumping Administrative Review on Imports of Industrial Nitrocellulose from France
Specific Case No.6
The administrative review
This case concerns the administrative review of anti-dumping duties on Industrial Nitrocellulose from France, produced and exported by Bergerac NC. (US case number A-427-009, 66 FR 54213 of 26 October 2001). The period of review is 1 August 1999 through 31 July 2000 and the rate of anti-dumping duty for Bergerac NC was 3.26% ad valorem.
Methodology
The practice of "zeroing", as applied in this case by the DOC, can briefly be described as follows. First, the DOC identified with respect to the product under investigation a certain number of different "models" or "types" of that product, what it calls Connum.- a common practice for both investigations and administrative reviews-.
Then, unlike in a new investigation, in an administrative review the DOC does not compare the average US price (export price) to the average home market price (normal value) for the whole investigation period. Instead, the DOC's practice is to compare the US net price for each individual US transaction to the most contemporaneous monthly average normal value.
The total value of the dumping margin is then calculated by aggregating only the transactionspecific positive dumped values and then multiplying the quantity sold in the US market for each model by the unit dumped value to arrive at the total dollars dumped. Comparisons of individual US transactions to weighted-average monthly normal value that yield negative margins are ignored (effectively treated as zero). The DOC applies this methodology in circumstances other than those specified in Article 2.4.2 of the ADA.
Because DOC determines margins on a transaction-specific basis in administrative reviews, no offsetting of negative margins is performed at either the Connum-specific or aggregate level. The DOC's methodology of aggregating the values of only the positive dumping margins based on the individual transactions means that there is no offset against the positive values at any stage.
Dumping margin without zeroing
By using the above methodology, DOC calculated a dumping margin of 3.26%. while without the zeroing methodology (i.e. with the negative unit margins included), the dumping margin would have been [...%] (lower).

UNITED STATES ­ LAWS, REGULATIONS AND METHODOLOGY FOR CALCULATING DUMPING MARGINS ("ZEROING")
Request for Consultations by the European Communities
Addendum
The following communication, dated 8 September 2003, from the Permanent Delegation of the European Commission to the Permanent Mission of the United States and to the Chairman of the Dispute Settlement Body, is circulated in accordance with Article 4.4 of the DSU.
_______________
The European Communities refers to the consultations held on 17 July 2003 concerning the United States of America's laws, regulations and methodology for calculating dumping margins ("zeroing") as applied in a number of new anti-dumping investigations and reviews, as set out in the European Communities' request for consultations dated 12 June 2003 (WT/DS294/1, G/L/630, G/ADP/D49/1). The European Communities hereby requests further consultations with the Government of the United States of America.
Further to the first round of consultations, the European Communities has identified additional investigations in which the US DOC applied the "zeroing" methodology in calculating the margin of dumping. The cases concerned are listed in the Annex attached hereto. For the sake of convenience, the Annex continues the numbering of Annex II of the original request for consultations and therefore starts at number 22.
This request is with respect to the determinations of dumping by the DOC, the determination of injury by the United States International Trade Commission and the DOC notice for the imposition of the anti-dumping duty in the cases listed in Annex.
The matters, which the EC would like to raise in the course of the additional consultations include, but are not limited to, the following:
(1) the zeroing of negative dumping margins when comparing export prices and normal values on a weighted average to weighted average basis;

WT/DS294/R Page A-21
(2) the impact of zeroing negative dumping margins in the determination of the "dumped imports" in the injury investigation;
(3) the determination of dumping margins above de minimis level as a result of zeroing negative dumping margins and the consequent imposition of an anti-dumping duty;
(4) the level of the dumping margins in the absence of zeroing in the cases listed in Annex.
The EC is concerned that the determinations in the listed cases appear to be, in several respects, not in conformity with the obligations of the United States under the GATT, and the Agreement on implementation of Article VI of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994 (the "ADA"), in particular under:
­ Articles 1, 2.4 (including 2.4.2), 3, 5.8 and 18.3 of the ADA,
­ Articles VI:1 and VI:2 of the GATT,
­ Article XVI:4 of the Marrakech Agreement establishing the WTO and Article 18.4 of the ADA.
We reserve the right to raise additional claims and legal matters regarding the legislation and practice during the course of the consultations.
We look forward to receiving your reply to this request and to fixing a mutually acceptable date for consultations.

UNITED STATES ­ LAWS, REGULATIONS AND METHODOLOGY FOR CALCULATING DUMPING MARGINS ("ZEROING")
Request for the Establishment of a Panel by the European Communities
Revision
The following communication, dated 16 February 2004, from the delegation of the European Commission to the Chairman of the Dispute Settlement Body, is circulated pursuant to Article 6.2 of the DSU.
_______________
1. Consultations
On 12 June 2003 and 8 September 2003, the European Communities requested consultations with the United States of America (the "United States") under Article 4 of the Understanding on Rules and Procedures Governing the Settlement of Disputes (the "DSU"); Article XXII:1 of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994 (the "GATT 1994"); and Articles 17.2 and 17.3 of the Agreement on implementation of Article VI of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994 (the "AD Agreement") with regard to the laws, regulations and methodologies for calculating dumping margins including zeroing practices1. Consultations were held on 17 July 2003 and 6 October 2003. They have allowed a better understanding of the respective positions of the parties, but have not led to a satisfactory resolution of the matter.

WT/DS294/R Page A-30
2. Summary of facts
In anti-dumping proceedings the United States uses the following methodologies to establish the dumping margin.
In original investigations, the United States identifies sub-groups of products within the product under investigation ("averaging groups") on a per model basis as well as on the basis of other criteria such as the level of trade. Within each of the averaging groups, a weighted average export price is established and compared to the corresponding weighted average normal value. The results of these comparisons on an "averaging group" basis are added up to establish the dumping margin of the product under investigation as a whole; however, in this process, any negative margins or amounts of "dumping" resulting from the comparison of weighted average normal values with weighted average export prices on an "averaging group" basis are put at zero. As a result, the United States calculates a margin and amount of dumping in excess of the actual dumping practised by the companies concerned.
In administrative review investigations, the United States determines the margin of dumping on the basis of a comparison of a weighted average normal value for each "averaging group" and individual export prices (the United States does not establish weighted average export prices in administrative review investigations). Here again, when adding up the results of the comparisons to determine the total amount or margin of dumping of the product under investigation, the United States puts at zero any negative amounts of "dumping". As a result, the United States calculates a margin of dumping and collects an amount of anti-dumping duty in excess of the actual dumping practised by the companies concerned. The United States uses this methodology systematically in all reviews including so-called newcomer review investigations (Article 9.5 of the AD Agreement), changed circumstances review investigations (Article 11.2 of the AD Agreement) and sunset review investigations (Article 11.3 of the AD Agreement).
These calculation methodologies are applied pursuant, in particular, to the following United States laws, regulations, administrative procedures and measures:
­ the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the "Act"), including the Statement of Administrative Action (the "SAA"), in particular Title VII and sections 731, 751, 771(35)(A), 771(35)(B) and 777(A)(d);
­ the implementing regulation2 of the United States Department of Commerce (the "DOC"), in particular section 351.414(c)(2); and
­ the Import Administration Antidumping Manual (1997 edition) (the "IA AD Manual") including the computer program(s) to which it refers.
The calculation methodologies described above were respectively applied in the determinations of dumping by the DOC in the original investigations listed in annex I and in the final results of the anti-dumping administrative review investigations listed in annex II.
3. Claims
3.1 As such claims
The European Communities considers that the above-mentioned United States laws, regulations, administrative procedures, measures and methodologies for determining the dumping
2 19 CFR Section 351.

WT/DS294/R Page A-31
margin in original investigations and review investigations are inconsistent with several provisions of the AD Agreement, GATT 1994 and the Marrakesh Agreement establishing the World Trade Organization , for the following reasons:
(a) in original investigations, the United States puts at zero the negative margins or amounts of "dumping" resulting from the comparison of weighted average normal values with weighted average export prices within the averaging groups. As a result, the United States calculates a margin and amount of dumping in excess of the actual dumping practised by the companies concerned. This constitutes a violation of:
· Articles 2.43 and 2.4.24 of the AD Agreement insofar as the comparison made by the United States is inconsistent with those provisions;
· Article 5.8 of the AD Agreement insofar as a de minimis dumping margin is erroneously determined to be not de minimis;
· Articles 9.1 and 9.3 of the AD Agreement insofar as there is as a result the imposition and collection of an anti-dumping duty in excess of the margin or amount of dumping as determined pursuant to Article 2 of the AD Agreement;
· Articles 1 and 2.1 of the AD Agreement and Articles VI:1 and VI:2 of the GATT 1994 insofar as there is as a result the imposition and collection of an anti-dumping duty which is inconsistent with the AD Agreement; and consequently of
· Article XVI:4 of the Marrakesh Agreement establishing the World Trade Organization and Article 18.4 of the AD Agreement insofar as the United States has not taken all necessary steps, of a general or particular character, to ensure the conformity of its laws, regulations and administrative procedures with the provisions of GATT 1994 and the AD Agreement.
(b) in review investigations, the United States systematically determines the margin of dumping on the basis of a comparison of a weighted average normal value and individual export prices and puts at zero the negative amounts of "dumping". As a result, the United States calculates a margin of dumping and collects an amount of anti-dumping duty in excess of the actual dumping practised by the companies concerned. This constitutes a violation of:
· Articles 2.4 and 2.4.2 of the AD Agreement5 insofar as the comparison made by the United States is inconsistent with those provisions;
· Articles 9.1 and 9.3 of the AD Agreement insofar as there is as a result the imposition and collection of an anti-dumping duty in excess of the margin of dumping determined pursuant to Article 2 of the AD Agreement;
3 "A fair comparison shall be made between the export price and the normal value ." 4 "Subject to the provisions governing fair comparison in paragraph 4, the existence of margins of dumping during the investigation phase shall normally be established on the basis of a comparison of a weighted average normal value with a weighted average of prices of all comparable export transactions or by a comparison of normal value and export prices on a transaction-to-transaction basis. A normal value established on a weighted average basis may be compared to prices of individual export transactions if the authorities find a pattern of export prices which differ significantly among different purchasers, regions or time periods, and if an explanation is provided as to why such differences cannot be taken into account appropriately by the use of a weighted average-to-weighted average or transaction-to-transaction comparison." 5 See footnotes 3 and 4.

· Articles 9.5 and 11 (including Articles 11.2 and 11.3) of the AD Agreement insofar as the determinations of dumping in review investigations contemplated by these provisions are not made in compliance with Articles 2.4 and 2.4.2 of the AD Agreement;
· Articles 1 and 2.1 of the AD Agreement and Articles VI:1 and VI:2 of the GATT 1994 insofar as there is as a result the imposition and collection of an anti-dumping duty which is inconsistent with the AD Agreement; and consequently of
· Article XVI:4 of the Marrakesh Agreement establishing the World Trade Organization and Article 18.4 of the AD Agreement insofar as the United States has not taken all necessary steps, of a general or particular character, to ensure the conformity of its laws, regulations and administrative procedures with the provisions of GATT 1994 and the AD Agreement.
3.2 As applied claims
In the specific anti-dumping proceedings annexed to the present request, the United States applied the methodologies and the laws, regulations, administrative procedures and measures described under point 2 above. In consequence, the European Communities considers that the determinations of dumping by DOC, the determinations of injury by the United States International Trade Commission, the imposition of definitive duties in the original investigations and the outcome of the administrative review investigations as detailed in the annexes are inconsistent with the AD Agreement, GATT 1994 and the Marrakesh Agreement establishing the World Trade Organization as follows:
(a) in the original investigations:
· Articles 1, 2.1, 2.4, 2.4.2, 5.8, 9.1 and 9.3 of the AD Agreement and Articles VI:1 and VI:2 of the GATT 1994, for the reasons set out under point 3.1(a) above;
· Article 3, including Articles 3.1, 3.2 and 3.5, of the AD Agreement insofar as the volume of "dumped imports" for the injury and causality determinations is determined on the basis of margins of dumping in excess of the actual margin of dumping of the companies concerned, with the result that imports from certain companies which should be excluded because of de minimis dumping margins are erroneously included in the "dumped imports"; and consequently
· Article XVI:4 of the Marrakesh Agreement establishing the World Trade Organization and Article 18.4 of the AD Agreement, for the reasons set out under point 3.1(a) above.
(b) in the administrative review investigations: Articles 1, 2.1 2.4, 2.4.2, 9.1, 9.3, and 11 (including Article 11.2) of the AD Agreement and Articles VI:1 and VI:2 of the GATT 1994, and consequently Article XVI:4 of the Marrakesh Agreement establishing the World Trade Organization and Article 18.4 of the AD Agreement, for the reasons set out under point 3.1(b) above.
