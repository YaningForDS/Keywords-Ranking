UNITED STATES ­ LAWS, REGULATIONS AND METHODOLOGY FOR CALCULATING DUMPING MARGINS ("ZEROING")
Request for Consultations by the European Communities
Addendum
The following communication, dated 8 September 2003, from the Permanent Delegation of the European Commission to the Permanent Mission of the United States and to the Chairman of the Dispute Settlement Body, is circulated in accordance with Article 4.4 of the DSU.
_______________
The European Communities refers to the consultations held on 17 July 2003 concerning the United States of America's laws, regulations and methodology for calculating dumping margins ("zeroing") as applied in a number of new anti-dumping investigations and reviews, as set out in the European Communities' request for consultations dated 12 June 2003 (WT/DS294/1, G/L/630, G/ADP/D49/1). The European Communities hereby requests further consultations with the Government of the United States of America.
Further to the first round of consultations, the European Communities has identified additional investigations in which the US DOC applied the "zeroing" methodology in calculating the margin of dumping. The cases concerned are listed in the Annex attached hereto. For the sake of convenience, the Annex continues the numbering of Annex II of the original request for consultations and therefore starts at number 22.
This request is with respect to the determinations of dumping by the DOC, the determination of injury by the United States International Trade Commission and the DOC notice for the imposition of the anti-dumping duty in the cases listed in Annex.
The matters, which the EC would like to raise in the course of the additional consultations include, but are not limited to, the following:
(1) the zeroing of negative dumping margins when comparing export prices and normal values on a weighted average to weighted average basis;
(2) the impact of zeroing negative dumping margins in the determination of the "dumped imports" in the injury investigation;
(3) the determination of dumping margins above de minimis level as a result of zeroing negative dumping margins and the consequent imposition of an anti-dumping duty;

WT/DS294/1/Add.1 G/L/630/Add.1 G/ADP/D49/1/Add.1 Page 2
(4) the level of the dumping margins in the absence of zeroing in the cases listed in Annex.
The EC is concerned that the determinations in the listed cases appear to be, in several respects, not in conformity with the obligations of the United States under the GATT, and the Agreement on implementation of Article VI of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994 (the "ADA"), in particular under:
­ Articles 1, 2.4 (including 2.4.2), 3, 5.8 and 18.3 of the ADA,
­ Articles VI:1 and VI:2 of the GATT,
­ Article XVI:4 of the Marrakech Agreement establishing the WTO and Article 18.4 of the ADA.
We reserve the right to raise additional claims and legal matters regarding the legislation and practice during the course of the consultations.
We look forward to receiving your reply to this request and to fixing a mutually acceptable date for consultations.

United States- Anti-dumping duties on Imports of Stainless Steel Wire Rod from Sweden
Specific Case No. 22
The measure
This case concerns the imposition of Anti-dumping duties on Stainless Steel Wire Rod from Sweden (US case number A-401-806, 63 FR 49329 of 15 September 1998). The rate of the ad valorem anti-dumping duty was 5.71% for Fagersta Stainless AB and all others.
Use of zeroing
In the United States Department of Commerce's investigation of Stainless Steel Wire Rod from Sweden, the Department of Commerce (DOC) utilised the same "zeroing" methodology as described under Specific Case No. 1.
Dumping margin without zeroing
In particular, by using the above methodology, DOC calculated a dumping margin of 5.71% for Fagersta Stainless AB while without the zeroing methodology (i.e. with the negative unit margins included), the dumping margin would have been [-...%] (negative) and the case would have been terminated with respect to this exporter.
