UNITED STATES ­ LAWS, REGULATIONS AND METHODOLOGY FOR CALCULATING DUMPING MARGINS ("ZEROING")
Request for Consultations by the European Communities
The following communication, dated 12 June 2003, from the Permanent Delegation of the European Commission to the Permanent Mission of the United States and to the Chairman of the Dispute Settlement Body, is circulated in accordance with Article 4.4 of the DSU.
_______________
On behalf of the European Communities (the "EC"), I hereby request consultations with the United States of America pursuant to Article 4 of the Understanding on Rules and Procedures Governing the Settlement of Disputes, Article XXII:1 of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994 (the "GATT") and Article 17 of the Agreement on implementation of Article VI of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994 (the "ADA").
This request is with respect to:
­ the Tariff Act of 1930 (the "Act"), in particular sections 751, 771(35)(A) and 771(35)(B),
­ the implementing regulation1 of the United States Department of Commerce (the "DOC"), in particular section 351.414(c)(2),
­ the methodology of the DOC for determining the dumping margin in new investigations on the basis of the comparison of a weighted average normal value with a weighted average export price,
­ the methodology of the DOC for determining the dumping margin in reviews,
­ the determinations of dumping by the DOC, the determination of injury by the United States International Trade Commission and the DOC notice for the imposition of the anti-dumping duty in the cases listed in Annex I,
­ and the final results of the anti-dumping administrative reviews listed in Annex II.
The matters, which the EC would like to raise in the course of the consultations include, but are not limited to, the following:
1 19 CFR Section 351.

WT/DS294/1 G/L/630 G/ADP/D49/1 Page 2
(1) in new investigations, the zeroing of negative dumping margins when comparing export prices and normal values on a weighted average to weighted average basis;
(2) in reviews, the comparison of export prices and normal values on a weighted average to transaction basis and the zeroing of negative dumping margins in circumstances other than those specified in Article 2.4.2 of the ADA;
(3) the impact of zeroing negative dumping margins in the determination of the "dumped imports" in the injury investigation;
(4) the determination of dumping margins above de minimis level as a result of zeroing negative dumping margins and the consequent imposition, continuation or collection of an antidumping duty;
(5) the level of the dumping margins in the absence of zeroing in the cases listed in Annex I and Annex II
The EC is concerned that the Act, related regulations, US methodologies and determinations in the listed cases appear to be, in several respects, not in conformity with the obligations of the United States under the GATT, and the ADA, in particular under:
­ Articles 1, 2.4 (including 2.4.2), 3, 5.8, 9.3, 9.5, 11 and 18.3 of the ADA,
­ Articles VI:1 and VI:2 of the GATT,
­ Article XVI:4 of the Marrakech Agreement establishing the WTO and Article 18.4 of the ADA.
We reserve the right to raise additional claims and legal matters regarding the legislation and practice during the course of the consultations.
We look forward to receiving your reply to this request to setting a mutually convenient date for these consultations.

United States ­ Anti-Dumping duties on Imports of Certain Hot-Rolled Carbon Steel Flat Products from the Netherlands
Specific Case No. l
The measure
This case concerns the imposition of anti-dumping duties on Certain Hot-Rolled Carbon Steel Flat products from the Netherlands (US case number A-421-807, 66 FR 59565 of 29 November 2001). The rate of the ad valorem anti-dumping duty was 2.59% for Corus Staal BV and all others.
Use of zeroing
In the United States Department of Commerce's investigation of Hot-Rolled Carbon Steel Flat Products from the Netherlands ("Hot-Rolled Steel"), the Department of Commerce (DOC) utilised a methodology commonly referred to as "zeroing".
The practice of "zeroing", as applied in this case by the DOC, can briefly be described as follows.
First, the DOC identified a number of different "models" or "types" of Hot-Rolled Steel, called connums.
Next, the DOC calculated, for each of these models, a weighted average normal value and a weighted average export price. Then, the DOC compared the weighted average normal value with the weighted average export price for each model. For some models, normal value was higher than export price; by subtracting export price from normal value for these models, the DOC established a "positive dumping margin" for each model. For other models, normal value was lower than export price; by subtracting export price from normal value for these other models, DOC established a "negative dumping margin" for each model. Thus, there is a "positive dumping margin" where there is dumping, and a "negative dumping margin" where there is not. The "positives" and "negatives" of the amounts in this calculation are an indication of precisely how much the export price is above or below the normal value.
Having made this calculation, the DOC then added up the amounts it had calculated as "dumping margins" for each model of the product in order to determine an overall dumping margin for the product as a whole. However, in doing so, the DOC treated any "negative dumping margin" as zero ­ hence the use of the word "zeroing". Then, finally, having added up the "positive dumping margins" and the zeroes, the DOC divided this sum by the cumulative total value of all the export transactions involving all types and models of that product. In this way, the DOC obtained an overall margin of dumping for the product under investigation.
This methodology is identical to the methodology that was held in breach of the WTO Anti-Dumping Agreement in European Communities - Anti-Dumping Duties on Imports of CottonType Bed Linen from India, (Panel Report, WT/DS141/R and Appellate Body Report, WT/DS141/AB/R, adopted 12 March 2001).

G/ADP/D49/1 Page 5
Dumping margin without zeroing
By using the above methodology, DOC calculated a dumping margin of 2.59% while without the zeroing methodology (i.e. with the negative unit margins included), the dumping margin would have been [- ..%] (negative) and the case would have been terminated.

United States ­ Anti-Dumping Administrative Review on Imports of Industrial Nitrocellulose from France
Specific Case No.6
The administrative review
This case concerns the administrative review of anti-dumping duties on Industrial Nitrocellulose from France, produced and exported by Bergerac NC. (US case number A-427-009, 66 FR 54213 of 26 October 2001). The period of review is 1 August 1999 through 31 July 2000 and the rate of anti-dumping duty for Bergerac NC was 3.26% ad valorem.
Methodology
The practice of "zeroing", as applied in this case by the DOC, can briefly be described as follows. First, the DOC identified with respect to the product under investigation a certain number of different "models" or "types" of that product, what it calls Connum.- a common practice for both investigations and administrative reviews-.
Then, unlike in a new investigation, in an administrative review the DOC does not compare the average US price (export price) to the average home market price (normal value) for the whole investigation period. Instead, the DOC's practice is to compare the US net price for each individual US transaction to the most contemporaneous monthly average normal value.
The total value of the dumping margin is then calculated by aggregating only the transactionspecific positive dumped values and then multiplying the quantity sold in the US market for each model by the unit dumped value to arrive at the total dollars dumped. Comparisons of individual US transactions to weighted-average monthly normal value that yield negative margins are ignored (effectively treated as zero). The DOC applies this methodology in circumstances other than those specified in Article 2.4.2 of the ADA.
Because DOC determines margins on a transaction-specific basis in administrative reviews, no offsetting of negative margins is performed at either the Connum-specific or aggregate level. The DOC's methodology of aggregating the values of only the positive dumping margins based on the individual transactions means that there is no offset against the positive values at any stage.
Dumping margin without zeroing
By using the above methodology, DOC calculated a dumping margin of 3.26%. while without the zeroing methodology (i.e. with the negative unit margins included), the dumping margin would have been [...%] (lower).
