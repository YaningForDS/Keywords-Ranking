UNITED STATES ­ CONTINUED EXISTENCE AND APPLICATION OF ZEROING METHODOLOGY
Request for the Establishment of a Panel by the European Communities
The following communication, dated 10 May 2007, from the delegation of the European Communities to the Chairman of the Dispute Settlement Body, is circulated pursuant to Article 6.2 of the DSU.
_______________
The European Communities hereby requests that a panel be established by DSB action pursuant to Articles 2.1 and 6.1 of the Understanding on Rules and Procedures Governing the Settlement of Disputes (the "DSU"); Article XXII:2 of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994 (the "GATT 1994"); and Articles 17.4 and 17.5 of the Agreement on Implementation of Article VI of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994 (the "AD Agreement") with regard to an "as such" measure or measures providing for the practice or methodologies for calculating dumping margins involving the use of zeroing, and the application of zeroing in certain specified anti-dumping measures maintained by the United States of America (the "United States"). On 2 October 2006, the European Communities requested consultations with the United States with a view to reaching a mutually satisfactory solution of the matter. The request was circulated in document WT/DS350/1 dated 3 October 2006. The consultations were held on 14 November 2006 and 28 February 2007 by video-conference on the above-mentioned measures. They have not led to a satisfactory resolution of the matter.
1. The facts
(a) When carrying out assessment and review proceedings of anti-dumping measures (socalled annual "administrative reviews"), the United States re-investigates and determines the margin of dumping on the basis of a comparison of a weighted average "normal value" for each "averaging group" and the prices of individual export transactions. When aggregating the results of these comparisons to determine the total amount or margin of dumping of the product under investigation, the United States puts at zero any negative amounts of "dumping". As a result, the United States calculates a margin of dumping and collects an amount of anti-dumping duty in excess of the actual margin of dumping practised by the exporters concerned. The United States uses this methodology systematically in all its annual administrative reviews of anti-dumping orders, and indeed in all types of review proceedings (including new shipper and changed circumstances review proceedings) in which it calculates a dumping margin.

WT/DS350/6 Page 2
The Appellate Body, in the case United States ­ Laws, Regulations and Methodology for Calculating Dumping Margins ("Zeroing") (WT/DS294/AB/R), found that the United States' use of zeroing in its "administrative reviews" was inconsistent with Article 9.3 of the AD Agreement and Article VI:2 of GATT 1994. In the same case and in the subsequent case of United States ­ Measures relating to Zeroing and Sunset Reviews (DS 322) it was also confirmed that the United States Department of Commerce (the "DOC") employed a "zeroing methodology" in calculating the margin of dumping in its "administrative reviews" as described above and that that this was inconsistent with Articles 2.4 and 9.3 of the AD Agreement..
This zeroing practice or methodology is applied pursuant, in particular, to:
- DOC's interpretation of Sections 771(35)(A) and (B), Section 731, Section 777A(d), and Section 751(a)(2)(A)(i) and (ii) of the United States Tariff Act of 1930, as interpreted by the United States Statement of Administrative Action, which accompanied the adoption of the United States Uruguay Round Agreements Act, giving effect in the United States to the WTO Agreements, and as upheld by US municipal courts;1
- the implementing regulation2 of the DOC, in particular section 351.414(c)(2);
- the Import Administration Antidumping Manual (1997 edition) (the "IA AD Manual") including the computer program(s) to which it refers;
- DOC's consistent and established practice; and
- DOC's zeroing methodology.
Since the WTO inconsistency of this practice or methodology is already established (notably in DS322) the European Communities does not ask the Panel to rule on the WTO inconsistency of this practice.
(b) The United States uses this practice or methodology in calculating dumping amounts or dumping margins, and in setting and collecting anti-dumping duties. The level of such anti-dumping duties is set in original proceedings, revised in administrative review proceedings or changed circumstances proceedings, and the need for the continued application of anti-dumping duties is decided in sunset review proceedings. In the latter DOC may determine that dumping is likely to continue or recur if the anti-dumping order were revoked, notably because dumping has continued at levels above de minimis after the issuance of the order. To find that dumping has continued after the issuance of the order, DOC relies on dumping margins calculated in the original proceeding and in administrative review proceedings using zeroing3. The
1 United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (04-1107) Corus Staal BV and Corus Steel USA INC. v Department of Commerce and Others, 21 December 2005, applying a US municipal law doctrine of judicial deference to executive interpretations of statute (the so-called "Chevron doctrine"), to the exclusion of a US municipal law doctrine which states that US courts should interpret US law whenever possible in a manner consistent with international obligations (the so-called "Charming Betsy doctrine").
2 19 CFR Section 351. 3 These dumping margins will normally have been established in original proceedings, in which the zeroing methodology condemned in DS 294 will usually have been used; Section 752(c)(3) of the Tariff Act of 1930, Section 315.218(e)(2)(i) of the DOC implementing regulation and paragraphs II.B of the Sunset Policy Bulletin.

WT/DS350/6 Page 3
EC has identified in the annex to this request a number of anti-dumping orders where duties are set and/or maintained on the basis of the above-mentioned zeroing practice or methodology with the result that duties are paid by importers either in excess of the dumping margin which would have been calculated using a WTO consistent methodology or are paid when no such duty would have resulted from the use of a WTO-consistent methodology.
2. The measures at issue and the legal basis of the complaint
The measures at issue and the legal basis of the complaint include, but are not limited to, the following:4
The continued application of, or the application of the specific anti-dumping duties resulting from the anti-dumping orders enumerated from I to XVIII in the Annex to the present request as calculated or maintained in place pursuant to the most recent administrative review or, as the case may be, original proceeding or changed circumstances or sunset review proceeding at a level in excess of the anti-dumping margin which would result from the correct application of the Anti-Dumping Agreement (whether duties or cash deposit rates or other form of measure).
In addition to these measures, the administrative reviews, or, as the case may be, original proceedings or changed circumstances or sunset review proceedings listed in the Annex (numbered 1 to 52) with the specific anti-dumping orders and are also considered by the EC to be measures subject to the current request for establishment of the panel in addition to the anti-dumping orders.
This includes the determinations in relation to all companies and includes any assessment instructions, whether automatic or otherwise, issued at any time pursuant to any of the measures listed in the Annex. The anti-dumping duties maintained (in whatever form) pursuant to these orders, and the administrative reviews, or, as the case may be, original proceedings and changed circumstances or sunset review proceedings listed in the Annex are inconsistent with the following provisions:
· Article 2.1 of the AD Agreement and Articles VI:1 and VI:2 of the GATT 1994, because the US did not determine a dumping margin for the product as a whole ;
· Articles 2.4 and 2.4.2 of the AD Agreement, whether considered in isolation or together with the obligations referred to in the first bullet point, insofar as the comparison made by the United States is unfair, uses an unjustified comparison method, employs zeroing, fails to calculate a margin of dumping for the product, and is otherwise inconsistent with those provisions;
· Article 5.8 of the AD Agreement insofar as a de minimis dumping margin is erroneously determined not to be de minimis;
· Articles 9.1 and 9.3 of the AD Agreement, whether considered in isolation or together with the obligations referred to in the first and second bullet points, insofar as there the imposition and collection of an anti-dumping duty in excess of the margin of dumping determined pursuant to Article 2 of the AD Agreement;
4 The measures at issue include all Issues and Decision Memorandums, and any similar documents; any computer programmes; any calculation memorandums; any other document that is part of the measure or record; and any assessment instructions.

WT/DS350/6 Page 4
· Articles 9.5 and 11 (including Articles 11.1, 11.2 and 11.3) of the AD Agreement, whether considered in isolation or together with the obligations referred to in the first and second bullet points, insofar as the determinations of dumping made or relied upon by the United States in review investigations are not made in compliance with Article 2 of the AD Agreement;
· Articles 11.1 and 11.3 of the AD Agreement insofar as the United States relied on a dumping margin which was not established for the product as a whole and not in conformity with Articles 2.4 and 2.4.2 of the AD Agreement;
· Articles 1 and 2.1 of the AD Agreement and Articles VI:1 and VI:2 of the GATT 1994 insofar as there is the imposition and collection of an anti-dumping duty which is inconsistent with the AD Agreement; and
· Article XVI:4 of the Marrakesh Agreement establishing the World Trade Organization and Article 18.4 of the AD Agreement insofar as the United States has not taken all necessary steps, of a general or particular character, to ensure the conformity of its laws, regulations and administrative procedures with the provisions of GATT 1994 and the AD Agreement.
The European Communities asks that this request be placed on the agenda for the meeting of the Dispute Settlement Body to be held on 22 May 2007.
