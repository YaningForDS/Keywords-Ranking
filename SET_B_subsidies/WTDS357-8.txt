UNITED STATES ­ SUBSIDIES AND OTHER DOMESTIC SUPPORT FOR CORN AND OTHER AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS
Request to Join Consultations
Communication from Nicaragua
The following communication, dated 19 January 2007, from the delegation of Nicaragua to the delegation of the United States, the delegation of Canada and to the Chairman of the Dispute Settlement Body, is circulated in accordance with Article 4.11 of the DSU.
_______________
Pursuant to paragraphs 10 and 11 of Article 4 of the Understanding on Rules and Procedures Governing the Settlement of Disputes (DSU), the Government of Nicaragua hereby notifies its interest to be joined in the consultations requested by the Government of Canada under Articles 1 and 4 of the DSU, Article XXII of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994, Articles 4, 7 and 30 of the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures, and Article 19 of the Agreement on Agriculture, regarding certain specified subsidies and other domestic support payments being provided by the U.S. government to U.S. producers and/or exporters of "corn and other agricultural products" (WT/DS357/1, G/L/812, G/SCM/D73/1, and G/AG/GEN/74).
Peanuts are one of the numerous "other agricultural products" now receiving support under the U.S. marketing loan payments, direct payments, and counter-cyclical payments raised in Canada's consultation request. For Nicaragua, peanuts represent the country's second largest agricultural export, delivering jobs and income to many thousands of Nicaraguan producers and allied workers in the rural areas of our country.
Because the U.S. marketing loan payments, direct payments, and counter-cyclical payments raised in Canada's request, as applied to peanuts, are undermining Nicaragua's peanut exports, and are contributing to the amount by which the United States is exceeding its Aggregate Measure of Support, Nicaragua respectfully asks that its "substantial trade interest" in these consultations be recognized.
