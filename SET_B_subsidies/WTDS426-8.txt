Communication from the Chairman of the Panel
The following communication, dated 13 June 2012, addressed to the Chairman of the Dispute Settlement Body, is circulated pursuant to Article 12.9 of the Dispute Settlement Understanding.
_______________
Article 12.8 of the Understanding on Rules and Procedures Governing the Settlement of Disputes (DSU) provides that the period in which a panel shall conduct its examination, from the date that the composition and terms of reference of the panel have been agreed upon until the date the final report is issued to the parties to the dispute, shall, as a general rule, not exceed six months.
Article 12.9 of the DSU provides that, when a panel considers that it cannot issue its report within six months, it shall inform the Dispute Settlement Body (DSB) in writing accordingly and indicate the reasons, together with an estimate of the period within which it will issue its report.
The Panel in Canada ­ Measures Relating to the Feed-in Tariff Program (DS426) was established by the DSB on 20 January 2012 and composed on 23 January 2012.
The timetable adopted by the Panel after consultations with the Parties to the dispute envisages that the final report shall be issued to the Parties by September 2012. However, due to the complexities of this dispute, it will not be possible for the Panel to complete its work within this timeframe.
The Panel now expects to complete its work by the end of November 2012.
