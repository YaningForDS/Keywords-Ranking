EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES ­ EXPORT SUBSIDIES ON SUGAR
Status Report by the European Communities
Addendum
The following communication, dated 24 May 2006, from the delegation of the European Communities to the Chairman of the Dispute Settlement Body, is circulated pursuant to Article 21.6 of the DSU.
_______________
Status Report Regarding Implementation of the DSB Recommendations and Rulings in the Dispute European Communities ­ Export Subsidies on Sugar
(WT/DS265, WT/DS266, WT/DS283)
The European Communities submits this second report in accordance with Article 21.6 of the Understanding on Rules and Procedures Governing the Settlement of Disputes (the "DSU"). A first status report was submitted on 5 May 2006.
On 19 May 2005 the Dispute Settlement Body (the "DSB") adopted the Panel and Appellate Body Reports in European Communities ­ Export Subsidies on Sugar.
On 28 October 2005 the arbitrator acting under Article 21.3(c) of the DSU determined the "reasonable period of time" for the European Communities to implement the recommendations and rulings of the DSB to be 12 months and 3 days, thus expiring on 22 May 2006.
Council Regulation (EC) No 318/2006 of 20 February 2006 on the common organization of the markets in the sugar sector sets out the framework for a comprehensive reform of the EU sugar sector. The sugar reform is expected to bring down the EU support price by 36%, EU production by 8 million tons and exports by more than 5 million tons. In a similar fashion to the provision of Article 27(14) of Regulation (EC) 1260/2001 in relation to exports with refunds, Article 34 of Regulation (EC) No 318/2006 provides for the respect of commitments in relation to all exports on the basis of export licences issued for the relevant marketing years. This regulation no longer requires C sugar (now termed "out-of quota sugar") to be exported.

WT/DS265/35/Add.1 WT/DS266/35/Add.1 WT/DS283/16/Add.1 Page 2
Regulation (EC) No 318/2006 also gives the necessary powers to the Commission to adopt the relevant implementing and transitional measures inter alia to ensure compliance for the purpose of this dispute. Article 44(b) provides in particular for transitional measures to ensure compliance with international obligations in relation to C sugar referred to in Article 13 of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001.
Following the discontinuation of the obligation to export provided in Article 13 of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001, Commission Regulation (EC) No 493/2006 of 27 March 2006 laying down transitional measures within the framework of the reform of the common organization of the markets in the sugar sector, and amending Regulation (EC) No 1265/2001 and (EC) No 314/2002 allows for carrying forward of C sugar to the 2006/2007 marketing year and provides that the remaining C sugar shall be considered as out-of-quota sugar for the marketing year 2006/2007 and thus subject to a surplus amount if not used in accordance with Article 12 of Regulation (EC) No 318/2006.
In addition, Commission Regulation (EC) No 769/2006 of 19 May 2006 suspending the lodging of applications for export licences for C sugar from 23 May 2006 and amending Regulation (EC) No 493/2006 as regards the transitional measures applicable to C sugar allows for the return of export licences for C sugar issued but not used by 22 May 2006 and suspends further issuance of export licences for C sugar from 23 May 2006.
On the basis of the above legal provisions, the European Communities is now in a position to maintain its subsidized exports of sugar within its commitments as from the marketing year 2006/2007, as well as applied on a pro rata basis for the remaining of the marketing year 2005/2006.
The European Communities has thus fully complied with the DSB rulings and recommendations in this dispute within the reasonable period of time specified for this purpose.

COUNCIL REGULATION (EC) No 318/2006 of 20 February 2006
on the common organisation of the markets in the sugar sector
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 36 and the third subparagraph of Article 37(2) thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Having regard to the Opinion from the European Parliament1,
Having regard to the Opinion from the European Economic and Social Committee2,
Whereas:
(1) The operation and development of the common market for agricultural products should be accompanied by the establishment of a common agricultural policy to include, in particular, a common organisation of agricultural markets which may take various forms depending on the product.
(2) The sugar market in the Community is based on principles which for other common market organisations have been substantially reformed in the past. In order to pursue the objectives set out in Article 33 of the Treaty, and notably in order to stabilise the markets and to ensure a fair standard of living for the agricultural community within the sugar sector, it is necessary to fundamentally review the common organisation of the market in the sugar sector.
(3) In the light of these developments, Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 of 19 June 2001 on the common organisation of the markets in the sugar sector 3 should be repealed and replaced by a new Regulation.
(4) Reference prices should be fixed for standard qualities of white sugar and raw sugar. Such standard qualities should be average qualities representative of sugar produced in the Community and defined on the basis of criteria used by the sugar trade. It should also be possible to review the standard qualities to take account, in particular, of commercial requirements and developments in technical analysis.
(5) In order to achieve reliable information on Community market prices for sugar, a price reporting system should be set up on the basis of which market price levels for white sugar should be determined.
1 Opinion delivered on 19 January 2006 (not yet published in the Official Journal). 2 Opinion delivered on 26 October 2005 (not yet published in the Official Journal). 3 OJ L 178, 30.6.2001, p. 1. Regulation as last amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 39/2004 (OJ L 6, 10.1.2004, p. 16).

WT/DS265/35/Add.1 WT/DS266/35/Add.1 WT/DS283/16/Add.1 Page 4
(6) A minimum price should be fixed for quota beet corresponding to a standard quality which should be defined, in order to ensure a fair standard of living for the Community growers of sugar beet and sugar cane.
(7) Specific instruments are needed to ensure a fair balance of rights and obligations between sugar undertakings and sugar beet growers. Therefore, standard provisions should be laid down to govern the contractual relations between buyers and sellers of sugar beet. The diversity of natural, economic and technical situations makes it difficult to provide for uniform purchase terms for sugar beet throughout the Community. Agreements within the trade already exist between associations of sugar beet growers and sugar undertakings. Therefore, framework provisions should only define the minimum guarantees required by both sugar beet growers and the sugar industry to ensure a smooth functioning of the sugar market with the possibility to derogate from some rules in the context of an agreement within the trade.
(8) The reasons which in the past led the Community to adopt a production quota system for sugar, isoglucose and inulin syrup still remain valid. However, due to developments within the Community and internationally, it is necessary to adjust the production system in order to provide for new arrangements and reductions of the quotas. In line with the previous quota system, a Member State should allocate quotas to the undertakings established within its territory. The new common organisation of the markets in the sugar sector should maintain the legal status of the quotas in so far as, according to the case-law of the Court of Justice, the system of quotas constitutes a mechanism for regulating the market in the sugar sector which aims to ensure the attainment of public interest objectives.
(9) Following the recent decisions on export subsidies of the World Trade Organisation Panel and the Appellate Body on EU export subsidies for sugar and in order for Community operators to ensure a smooth change-over from the previous quota system to the present system, it should be possible during the marketing year 2006/2007 for sugar undertakings to be allocated an additional quota under conditions that take into account the lower value of C sugar.
(10) To counterbalance the effects on isoglucose of the fall in sugar prices, as well as to avoid penalizing the production of some isoglucose qualities, additional quotas should be allocated to the current isoglucose beneficiaries. Moreover, supplementary quotas should be available for adjustments of the sweeteners sector of some Member States under the conditions provided for granting additional sugar quota.
(11) To ensure that the Community's production of sugar, isoglucose and inulin syrup is reduced sufficiently, the Commission should be entitled to adjust the quotas to a sustainable level after the termination of the restructuring fund in 2010.
(12) Given the need to allow for a certain national flexibility in relation to the structural adjustment of the processing industry and of beet and cane growing during the period in which the quotas are to be applied, Member States should be allowed to alter the quotas of undertakings within certain limits whilst not restricting the operation of the restructuring fund established by Council Regulation (EC) No 320/2006 of 20 February 2006 establishing a temporary scheme for the restructuring of the sugar industry in the Community 4 as an instrument.

WT/DS265/35Add.1 WT/DS266/35/Add.1 WT/DS283/16/Add.1
Page 5
(13) The sugar quotas are allocated or reduced following a merger or transfer of undertakings, the transfer of a factory, or the lease of a factory. The conditions for adjustment by the Member States of the quotas of the undertakings in question should be established while ensuring that changes to the quotas of sugar undertakings are not detrimental to the interests of the beet growers or cane growers concerned.
(14) Since allocating quota production to undertakings is a way of ensuring that sugar beet and cane growers are paid Community prices and have an outlet for their production, the interests of all parties concerned, in particular beet and cane growers, should be taken into consideration when quotas are transferred inside production regions.
(15) To expand the outlets for sugar, isoglucose and inulin syrup on the Community's internal market, it should be possible to consider sugar, isoglucose and inulin syrup used for manufacture in the Community of certain products such as chemical, pharmaceutical, alcohol or rum, as out-of-quota production under conditions to be laid down.
(16) A part of the out of quota production should be used to ensure the adequate supply to the outermost regions or could be exported under the Community's WTO commitments.
(17) Should the production of sugar, isoglucose or inulin syrup exceed the quotas, it should be possible to provide for a mechanism to carry forward the surplus sugar, isoglucose or inulin syrup to be treated as quota production of the following marketing year, in order to avoid the surplus sugar distorting the sugar market.
(18) Certain mechanisms are available for out of quota production. If, for certain quantities, the applicable conditions are not met, a levy on the surplus should be imposed in order to avoid the accumulation of these quantities threatening the market situation.
(19) A production charge should be introduced to contribute to the financing of the expenditure occurring under the common organisation of the markets in the sugar sector.
(20) In order to provide for an efficient control of the production of operators producing sugar, isoglucose or inulin syrup, an approval system for operators should be established and detailed information in relation to their production should be submitted to the Member State concerned.
(21) A temporary and limited buying-in intervention system should be kept in place in order to contribute to stabilising the market for cases where market prices in a given marketing year would fall below the reference price fixed for the following marketing year.
(22) New market tools to be managed by the Commission should be introduced. Firstly, if market prices fall below the reference price for white sugar, it should be possible for operators, under conditions to be determined by the Commission, to benefit from a private storage scheme. Secondly, to maintain the structural balance of the markets in sugar at a price level close to the reference price, it should be possible for the Commission to decide to withdraw sugar from the market for as long as it takes for the market to rebalance.
(23) The creation of a single Community market for sugar involves the introduction of a trading system at the external borders of the Community. That trading system should include import duties and export refunds and should, in principle, stabilise the Community market. The

WT/DS265/35/Add.1 WT/DS266/35/Add.1 WT/DS283/16/Add.1 Page 6
trading system should be based on the undertakings accepted under the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations.
(24) In order to monitor the volume in trade in sugar with third countries, provision should be made for an import and export licence scheme with the lodging of a security to ensure that the transactions for which such licences are issued are actually carried out.
(25) To ensure that those trading arrangements can function properly, provision should be made for regulating or, when the situation on the market so requires, prohibiting the use of inward processing arrangements.
(26) The customs duty system makes it possible to dispense with all other protective measures at the external frontiers of the Community. The internal market and duty mechanism could, in exceptional circumstances, prove to be inadequate. In such cases, in order not to leave the Community market without defence against disturbances that might ensue, the Community should be able to take all necessary measures without delay. Such measures should comply with the international commitments of the Community.
(27) For the most part, the customs duties applicable to agricultural products under the WTO agreements are laid down in the common customs tariff. However, for some products falling within the scope of this Regulation, the introduction of additional mechanisms makes it necessary to provide for the possibility to adopt derogations.
(28) In order to prevent or counteract adverse effects on the Community market which could result from imports of certain agricultural products, imports of such products should be subject to payment of an additional duty, if certain conditions are fulfilled.
(29) It is appropriate, under certain conditions, to confer on the Commission the power to open and administer tariff quotas resulting from international agreements concluded in accordance with the Treaty or from other acts of the Council.
(30) The Community has several preferential market access arrangements with third countries which allow those countries to export cane sugar to the Community under favourable conditions. Therefore, it is necessary to evaluate refiners' need for sugar for refining and, under certain conditions, to reserve import licences to specialised users of notable quantities of imported raw cane sugar, deemed as being full-time refiners in the Community.
(31) Provisions for granting refunds on exports to third countries, based on the difference between prices within the Community and on the world market, and falling within the limits set by the EC's commitments in the WTO, should serve to safeguard the possible Community participation in international trade in sugar. Subsidised exports should be subject to limits in terms of quantity and budgetary outlay.
(32) Compliance with the limits in terms of value should be ensured at the time when the export refunds are fixed through the monitoring of payments under the rules relating to the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund. Monitoring can be facilitated by the compulsory advance fixing of export refunds, while allowing the possibility, in the case of differentiated refunds, of changing the specified destination within a geographical area to which a single export refund rate applies. In the case of a change of destination, the export refund applicable to the actual destination should be paid, with a ceiling of the amount applicable to the destination fixed in advance.

WT/DS265/35Add.1 WT/DS266/35/Add.1 WT/DS283/16/Add.1
Page 7
(33) Compliance with the quantity limits should be ensured by a reliable and effective system of monitoring. To that end, the granting of export refunds should be made subject to an export licence. Export refunds should be granted up to the limits available, depending on the particular situation of each product concerned. Exceptions to that rule should be permitted only for processed products not listed in Annex I to the Treaty, to which volume limits do not apply. Provision should be made for derogating from strict compliance with management rules where exports benefiting from export refunds are not likely to exceed the quantity laid down.
(34) The proper working of the single market based on common prices would be jeopardised by the granting of national aid. Therefore, the provisions of the Treaty governing State aid should apply to the products covered by this common market organisation. However, with a view to attenuating the effects the reform of the sugar sector is expected to have in certain circumstances the granting of certain State aid should be allowed.
(35) In Member States with a significant reduction of sugar quota sugar beet producers will face particularly severe adaptation problems. In such cases the transitional Community aid to sugar beet growers will not suffice to fully address the beet growers' difficulties. Therefore, Member States having reduced their quota by more than 50 % should be authorised to grant State aid to sugar beet growers during the application period of the transitional Community aid. To avoid Member States granting State aid exceeding the needs of their sugar beet growers the determination of the total amount of the State aid concerned should be made subject to Commission approval, except in the case of Italy where the maximum need for most productive sugar beet to adapt to the market conditions after the reform can be estimated at EUR 11 per tonne of sugar beet produced. Moreover, due to the particular problems expected to arise in Italy provision should be made for arrangements allowing sugar beet growers to benefit directly or indirectly from the State aid granted. 28.2.2006 EN Official Journal of the European Union L 58/3
(36) In Finland sugar beet growing is subject to particular geographical and climatic conditions which will adversely affect the growing beyond the general effects of the sugar reform. For this reason provision should be made for authorising that Member State on a permanent basis to grant its sugar beet growers an adequate amount of State aid.
(37) It is appropriate to provide for measures to be taken when a substantial rise or fall in prices disturbs or threatens to disturb the Community market. These measures may include the opening of a quota at reduced tariff for imports of sugar from the world market for the time necessary.
(38) Since the common market in sugar is continuously evolving, the Member States and the Commission should keep each informed of relevant developments.
(39) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission5.
(40) The Commission should be authorised to adopt necessary measures to solve specific practical problems in case of emergency.

WT/DS265/35/Add.1 WT/DS266/35/Add.1 WT/DS283/16/Add.1 Page 8
(41) The characteristics of sugar production in the outermost regions of the Community distinguish that production from sugar production in the rest of the Community. Financial support should therefore be given to the sector by allocating resources to farmers in those regions after the entry into force of the support programmes to assist local production which Member States draw up under Council Regulation (EC) No 247/2006 of 30 January 2006 laying down specific measures for agriculture in the outermost regions of the Union6. For the same reason, France should be authorised to grant a fixed amount of State aid to its outermost regions.
(42) Expenditure incurred by the Member States as a result of the obligations arising from the application of this Regulation should be financed by the Community in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No 1258/1999 of 17 May 1999 on the financing of the common agricultural policy7, and, as from 1 January 2007 in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005 of 21 June 2005 on the financing of the common agricultural policy.
(43) The change-over from the arrangements in Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 to those provided for in this Regulation as well as the change-over from the market situation in the marketing year 2005/2006 to the market situation in the marketing year 2006/2007 and in order to ensure compliance by the Community with its international commitments with regard to C sugar referred to in Article 13 of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 could give rise to difficulties which are not dealt with in this Regulation. In order to deal with such difficulties, the Commission should be enabled to adopt transitional measures,

2. Throughout the marketing years 2006/2007, 2007/2008, 2008/2009 and 2009/2010, the intervention agency designated by each sugar-producing Member State shall buy in, up to a total quantity of 600 000 tonnes, expressed in white sugar, per marketing year for the Community, any white or raw sugar offered to it provided that the sugar concerned:
-- has been produced under quota and manufactured from beet or cane harvested in the Community,

WT/DS265/35Add.1 WT/DS266/35/Add.1 WT/DS283/16/Add.1
Page 21
-- has been the subject of a storage contract concluded between the seller and the intervention agency.
Intervention agencies shall buy in at 80 % of the reference price fixed in Article 3 for the marketing year following the marketing year during which the offer is lodged. If the quality of the sugar differs from the standard quality for which the reference price is fixed, this price shall be increased or reduced accordingly.
3. Intervention agencies may sell sugar only at a price which is higher than the reference price fixed for the marketing year in which the sale takes place.
However, it may be decided in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 39(2), whilst respecting the commitments resulting from agreements concluded under Article 300 of the Treaty, that intervention agencies:
(a) may sell sugar at a price equal to or lower than the reference price referred to in the first subparagraph if the sugar is intended:

(b) are to make unprocessed sugar held by them available, for human consumption on the internal market of the Community, to charitable organisations -- recognised by the Member State concerned or by the Commission in cases where a Member State has not recognised any such organisation -- at a price which is lower than the current reference price or free of charge for the distribution as part of individual emergency aid operations.
Article 19
Withdrawal of sugar
1. In order to preserve the structural balance of the market at a price level which is close to the reference price, taking into account the commitments of the Community resulting from agreements concluded in accordance with Article 300 of the Treaty, a percentage, common to all Member States, of quota sugar, quota isoglucose and quota inulin syrup may be withdrawn from the market until the beginning of the following marketing year.
In that case, the traditional supply need for refining imported raw sugar referred to in Article 29(1) of this Regulation shall be reduced by the same percentage for the marketing year concerned.
2. The withdrawal percentage referred to in paragraph 1 shall be determined by 31 October of the marketing year concerned at the latest on the basis of expected market trends during that marketing year.

WT/DS265/35/Add.1 WT/DS266/35/Add.1 WT/DS283/16/Add.1 Page 22
3. Each undertaking provided with a quota shall store at its own expense during the period of withdrawal the quantities of sugar corresponding to the application of the percentage referred to in paragraph 1 to its production under quota for the marketing year concerned.
The sugar quantities withdrawn during a marketing year shall be treated as the first quantities produced under quota for the following marketing year. However, taking into account the expected sugar market trends, it may be decided, in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 39(2), to consider, for the current and/or the following marketing year, all or part of the withdrawn sugar, isoglucose or inulin syrup as:
-- surplus sugar, surplus isoglucose or surplus inulin syrup available to become industrial sugar, industrial isoglucose or industrial inulin syrup,
or
-- temporary quota production of which a part may be reserved for export respecting commitments of the Community resulting from agreements concluded under Article 300 of the Treaty.
4. If sugar supply in the Community is inadequate, it may be decided, in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 39(2), that a certain quantity of withdrawn sugar, isoglucose and inulin syrup may be sold on the Community market before the end of the period of withdrawal.
Article 20
Storage under different measures
Sugar stored under one of the measures referred to in Article 14, Article 18 or Article 19 during a marketing year may not be subject to private or public storage under any other of those provisions.

COMMISSION REGULATION (EC) No 493/2006
of 27 March 2006
laying down transitional measures within the framework of the reform of the common organisation of the markets in the sugar sector,
and amending Regulations (EC) No 1265/2001 and (EC) No 314/2002
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 318/2006 of 20 February 2006 on the common organisation of the markets in the sugar sector1, and in particular Article 44 thereof,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 of 19 June 2001 on the common organisation of the markets in the sugar sector2, and in particular Articles 7(5), 15(8) and 16(5) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) The necessary measures should be taken to facilitate the transition in the sugar sector from the rules provided for in Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 to the new regime established by Regulation (EC) No 318/2006.
(2) Following the deletion of the obligation to export provided for in Article 13 of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001, measures should be laid down to manage the quantities of sugar resulting from the disappearance of this obligation and of the C sugar arrangements from 1 July 2006. These measures should comply with the Community's international obligations.
(3) To improve management of the quantities of sugar produced in excess of the quota attributable to the 2005/2006 marketing year, undertakings should be allowed to carry forward some of these quantities to the 2006/2007 marketing year. To this end, it should be laid down that the carry forward in question is subject to the application of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 65/82 of 13 January 1982 laying down detailed rules for carrying forward sugar to the following marketing year3, while allowing a certain degree of flexibility on the decision to carry forward in order to facilitate the transition between the existing regime and the new regime.
(4) The quantity of non-quota sugar in the 2005/2006 marketing year, which may be neither carried over nor exported, should be considered to be non-quota sugar in the 2006/2007 marketing year in order to allow its disposal through the uses provided for in respect of this sugar by Regulation (EC) No 318/2006, as well as, taking into account the exceptional conditions of the transition between those marketing years, its use in animal feed.
1 OJ L 58, 28.2.2006, p. 1. 2 OJ L 178, 30.6.2001, p. 1. Regulation as last amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 39/2004 (OJ L 6, 10.1.2004, p. 16). 3 OJ L 9, 14.1.1982, p. 14. Regulation as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2223/2000 (OJ L 253, 7.10.2000, p. 15).

WT/DS265/35/Add.1 WT/DS266/35/Add.1 WT/DS283/16/Add.1 Page 54
(5) For control purposes and, where applicable, the application of penalties, the proportion of C sugar production in the 2005/2006 marketing year not carried over and not considered to be in excess of the quota in the 2006/2007 marketing year should continue to be subject to the application of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2670/81 of 14 September 1981 laying down detailed implementing rules in respect of sugar production in excess of the quota4 .
(6) In order to improve the market balance in the Community without creating new stocks of sugar in the 2006/2007 marketing year, provision should be made for a transitional measure to reduce eligible production under quota in respect of that marketing year. A threshold should be fixed above which the production under quota of each undertaking is considered withdrawn within the meaning of Article 19 of Regulation (EC) No 318/2006 or, at the request of the undertaking, as production in excess of the quota within the meaning of Article 12 of that Regulation. In view of the transition between the two regimes, this threshold should be obtained by a combination, in equal parts, of the method laid down in Article 10 of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 and that laid down in Article 19 of Regulation (EC) No 318/2006 and take into account the special efforts made by some Member States within the framework of the restructuring fund set up by Council Regulation (EC) No 320/2006 of 20 February 2006 establishing a temporary scheme for the restructuring of the sugar industry in the Community and amending Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005 on the financing of the common agricultural policy5.
(7) In order to comply with the marketing conditions for the 2005/2006 marketing year, it should be laid down that the aid for disposal and additional aid for sugar produced in certain regions of the Community in the 2005/2006 marketing year and, within the limits of the quantities set by Commission Regulation (EC) No 180/2006 of 1 February 20066, the refining aid for certain preferential sugars imported and refined in the 2005/2006 delivery period may continue to be paid beyond 30 June 2006. To this end, Commission Regulation (EC) No 1554/2001 of 30 July 2001 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 as regards marketing sugar produced in the French overseas departments and equalising the price conditions with preferential raw sugar7 and Commission Regulation (EC) No 1646/2001 of 13 August 2001 laying down detailed implementing rules for the grant of adjustment aid to the preferential raw sugar refining industry and adjusting both the adjustment aid and additional basic aid for the sugar refining industry8 (8) should continue to apply to the granting of these aids. For the sugar concerned the refining of preferential sugars by certain refineries should continue to be limited and the control on presumed maximum supply needs should be maintained, and provision should be made for the continued application of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1460/2003 of 18 August 2003 setting for the 2003/2004 to 2005/2006 marketing years rules of application for Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 as regards the presumed maximum raw sugar supply needs of refineries9.

(8) To carry out the calculation, fixing and collecting of production levies in the 2005/2006 marketing year, certain provisions of Commission Regulation (EC) No 314/2002 of 20 February 2002 laying down detailed rules for the application of the quota system in the sugar sector10 (10) and of Commission Regulation (EC) No 779/96 of 29 April 1996 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1785/81 as regards communications in the sugar sector11 should continue to apply beyond 30 June 2006. The levies are calculated on the basis of statistical data which are regularly updated. As it is the last time that levies are to be fixed for the entire period between the 2001/2002 marketing year and the 2005/2006 marketing year, without a subsequent possibility, as in previous years, to adjust the calculations on the basis of updated figures, the calculation should be deferred and the levies should be fixed on 15 February 2007 to guarantee the reliability of the calculations and the relevance of the statistical data used.
(9) In order to ensure the supply to the chemical industry in the context of the transition between the existing regime and the new regime introduced on 1 July 2006, certain provisions of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1265/2001 of 27 June 2001 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 as regards granting the production refund on certain sugar products used in the chemical industry12 (12) should continue to apply beyond 30 June 2006 to the refund certificates issued before that date. Since the new regime allows the use by the chemical industry of nonquota sugar, the period of validity of the export certificates should be reduced and the granting of the refund should be limited to the production under quota in the 2005/2006 marketing year.
(10) Under Article 1(2) of Regulation (EC) No 318/2006, the period covered by the marketing year begins on 1 October and ends on 30 September of the following year. However, the 2005/2006 marketing year, as laid down by Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001, ends on 30 June 2006. The 2006/2007 marketing year therefore begins on 1 July 2006 and ends on 30 September 2007, and thus extends over 15 months. For the 2006/2007 marketing year, therefore, provision should be made for an increase in the quotas and the traditional refining requirements which previously corresponded to a 12-month period and which will, after this marketing year, again apply to a 12-month period, by taking the extra three months into account so as to ensure an allocation which corresponds to that of the preceding and subsequent marketing years. These transitional quotas should cover sugar production from the start of the 2006/2007 marketing year, from sugar beet sown before 1 January 2006.
(11) Regulations (EC) No 314/2002 and (EC) No 1265/2001 should therefore be amended accordingly.
(12) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Sugar,

Preventive withdrawal
1. For each undertaking, the share of the production of sugar, isoglucose or inulin syrup in the 2006/2007 marketing year which is produced under the quotas listed in Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 318/2006 and which exceeds the threshold established in accordance with paragraph 2 of this Article shall be considered withdrawn within the meaning of Article 19 of that Regulation or, at the request of the undertaking concerned before 31 January 2007, shall be considered fully or partially to be produced in excess of the quota within the meaning of Article 12 of that Regulation.
2. For each undertaking, the threshold referred to in paragraph 1 shall be established by multiplying the quota allocated to the undertaking under Article 7(2) of Regulation (EC) No 318/2006 by the sum of the following coefficients:
(a) the coefficient fixed for the Member State concerned in Annex I to this Regulation;
(b) the coefficient obtained by dividing the sum of the quotas renounced in the 2006/2007 marketing year in the Member State concerned under Article 3 of Regulation (EC) No 320/2006 by the sum of the quotas fixed for that Member State in Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 318/2006. The Commission shall fix this coefficient not later than 15 October 2006.
However, where the sum of the coefficients exceeds 1,0000, the threshold shall be equal to the quota referred to in paragraph 1.

COMMISSION REGULATION (EC) No 769/2006
of 19 May 2006
suspending the lodging of applications for export licences for C sugar from 23 May 2006 and amending Regulation (EC) No 493/2006
as regards the transitional measures applicable to C sugar
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 318/2006 of 20 February 2006 on the common organisation of the markets in the sugar sector1, and in particular Article 44 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) The Agreement on Agriculture concluded under the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations2 in accordance with Article 300 of the Treaty contains limits on the quantity and value of exports subsidised by the Community. As a result of the conclusions of the World Trade Organisation's (WTO) Appellate Body of 19 May 2005, exports of C sugar must be taken into account in those limits. The Community has been granted a period ending on 22 May 2006 to comply with its WTO obligations.
(2) Article 13(1) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 of 19 June 2001 on the common organisation of the markets in the sugar sector3 provides in particular for an obligation to export C sugar not carried forward. Regulation (EC) No 318/2006, which applies from 1 July 2006, no longer includes such an obligation for non-quota sugar produced in respect of the 2006/07 marketing year. Article 44 of that Regulation provides for the possibility of adopting transitional measures to facilitate the transition from the market situation in the 2005/06 marketing year to the market situation in the 2006/07 marketing year, and the derogations required to ensure compliance by the Community with its international obligations with regard to C sugar produced in respect of the 2005/06 marketing year.
(3) In accordance with Article 44 of Regulation (EC) No 318/2006, Article 2(1) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 493/2006 of 27 March 2006 laying down transitional measures within the framework of the reform of the common organisation of the markets in the sugar sector, and amending Regulations (EC) No 1265/2001 and (EC) No 314/20024, from 1 July 2006 C sugar produced in respect of the 2005/06 marketing year which cannot be carried forward or exported is to be considered non-quota sugar as referred to in Regulation (EC) No 318/2006, produced in respect of the 2006/07 marketing year.
(4) Article 27(14) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 provides that compliance with the restrictions on volume resulting from agreements concluded under Article 300 of the Treaty is
1 OJ L 58, 28.2.2006, p. 1. 2 OJ L 336, 23.12.1994, p. 22. 3 OJ L 178, 30.6.2001, p. 1. Regulation as repealed by Regulation (EC) No 318/2006. 4 OJ L 89, 28.3.2006, p. 11.

WT/DS265/35Add.1 WT/DS266/35/Add.1 WT/DS283/16/Add.1

to be ensured by means of export licences issued for the reerence periods provided for in such agreements.
(5) As a result, taking into account the obligations of the European Community under the WTO agreements, a derogation from the obligation to export C sugar should be laid down by suspending the lodging of applications for export licences for C sugar from 23 May 2006, and the transitional arrangements provided for in Article 2 of Regulation (EC) No 493/2006 should be applied to C sugar not exported under an export licence issued before 23 May 2006.
(6) Regulation (EC) No 493/2006 should therefore be amended accordingly.
(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Sugar,
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
Article 1
The lodging of applications for export licences for C sugar in accordance with Commission Regulation (EC) No 1464/955 (5) is hereby suspended from 23 May 2006. Applications for export licences submitted during the period of suspension shall be inadmissible.
Export licences for C sugar issued but not used by 22 May 2006 may be returned to the issuing body during their period of validity. In such cases, notwithstanding Article 35 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1291/20006, the security shall be released immediately.
Article 2
Regulation (EC) No 493/2006 is hereby amended as follows:
1. Article 2(1) is replaced by the following:
`1. Without prejudice to decisions to carry forward taken in accordance with Article 1 of this Regulation, C sugar from the 2005/06 marketing year not exported under an export licence issued before 23 May 2006 shall be considered, from that date, to be non-quota sugar, as referred to in Article 12 of Regulation (EC) No 318/2006, produced in respect of the 2006/07 marketing year.';
2. the following sentence is added to the second paragraph of Article 13:
`Article 2 shall apply from 23 May 2006.'
