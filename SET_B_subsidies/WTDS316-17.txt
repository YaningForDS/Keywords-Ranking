EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES AND CERTAIN MEMBER STATES ­ MEASURES AFFECTING TRADE IN LARGE CIVIL AIRCRAFT
Communication from the European Union
The following communication, dated 1 December 2011, from the delegation of the European Union to the Chairperson of the Dispute Settlement Body, is circulated at the request of that delegation.
_______________
1. The European Union refers to the recommendations and rulings of the WTO Dispute Settlement Body (DSB) with respect to the dispute European Communities and Certain Member States ­ Measures Affecting Trade in Large Civil Aircraft (WT/DS316). The European Union would like to inform the DSB that it has taken appropriate steps to bring its measures fully into conformity with its WTO obligations, and to comply with the DSB's recommendations and rulings.
2. In considering appropriate steps to bring its measures into conformity with its WTO obligations, the European Union took note of all elements of the DSB's recommendations and rulings, including, in particular, the Appellate Body's guidance on the way in which subsidies and adverse effects expire, dissipate, terminate or are otherwise removed or withdrawn. In undertaking this review, we consulted, among others, independent experts in: financial economics; investor behaviour; financial and cost auditing, accounting and controlling; product engineering; and Large Civil Aircraft (LCA) fleet management. We have also closely monitored and assessed LCA product and market developments in the months and years following the period covered by the Panel's review.
3. As a result of this review, the European Union has adopted a course of action that addresses all forms of adverse effects, all categories of subsidies, and all models of Airbus aircraft covered by the DSB's recommendations and rulings.
4. Specifically, in bringing its measures into conformity with its WTO obligations, the European Union has addressed all categories of subsidy covered by the DSB's recommendations and rulings: Member State Financing (MSF) loans, capital contributions, infrastructure support and regional aid. Amongst others, the European Union has secured repayment of MSF loans and terminated MSF agreements, increased fees and lease payments on infrastructure support to accord with market principles, and ensured that capital contributions and regional aid subsidies have, in the Appellate Body's words, "come to an end" and are no longer capable of causing adverse effects. Additionally, the course of action adopted by the European Union affects Airbus' A300, A310, A320, A330, A340 and A380 aircraft, as well as derivatives thereof, as implicated by the DSB's recommendations and rulings. Finally, as a result of these steps and other intervening market events, the European Union
 Formerly the EC.

has addressed the forms of adverse effects covered by the DSB's rulings. Information concerning the steps that have been taken by the European Union is provided in the attached list.
5. In short, by having taken appropriate steps to bring our measures into conformity with our WTO obligations, as required by Article 7.8 of the SCM Agreement and Article 19.1 of the DSU, the European Union has ensured full implementation of the DSB's recommendations and rulings.
