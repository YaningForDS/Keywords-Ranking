CHINA ­ CERTAIN MEASURES GRANTING REFUNDS, REDUCTIONS OR EXEMPTIONS FROM TAXES AND OTHER PAYMENTS
Request for Further Consultations by the United States
Addendum
The following communication, dated 27 April 2007, from the delegation of the United States to the delegation of China and to the Chairman of the Dispute Settlement Body, is circulated in accordance with Article 4.4 of the DSU.
_______________
As you know, on 20 March 2007, pursuant to the request of the United States (DS358/1), the People's Republic of China and the United States held consultations concerning certain measures granting refunds, reductions, or exemptions from taxes or other payments otherwise due to the government by enterprises in China. Through those consultations held pursuant to Articles 1 and 4 of the Understanding on Rules and Procedures Governing the Settlement of Disputes ("DSU"), Article XXII:1 of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994 ("GATT 1994"), Articles 4 and 30 of the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures ("SCM Agreement"), and Article 8 of the Agreement on Trade-Related Investment Measures ("TRIMs Agreement"), and confirmed by subsequent review, we understand that China has repealed a subsidy program based on the disbursement of loans at discounted lending rates, identified in our initial consultation request as the Circular of the People's Bank of China, the State Administration of Foreign Exchange, the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation and the State Administration of Taxation Concerning Printing and Distribution Detailed Rules on Rewarding and Punishment Concerning Provisional Regulations over Examination of Export Collections of Foreign Exchange. In addition, with regard to the Income Tax Law of the People's Republic of China on Enterprises with Foreign Investment and Foreign Enterprises, also identified in our initial consultation request, we have learned that China recently adopted a new income tax law, the Enterprise Income Tax Law of the People's Republic of China.
To take these developments into account, my authorities have instructed me to modify our identification of the measures at issue and request supplemental consultations with the Government of the People's Republic of China pursuant to Articles 1 and 4 of the DSU, Article XXII:1 of the GATT 1994, Articles 4 and 30 of the SCM Agreement, and Article 8 of the TRIMs Agreement, with regard to certain measures granting refunds, reductions, or exemptions from taxes or other payments otherwise due to the government by enterprises in China. As required by Article 4.2 of the SCM Agreement, a Statement of Available Evidence is attached to this request for supplemental consultations.

· Parts IV and VIII of the Enterprise Income Tax Law of the People's Republic of China;14 · Article 3 of the Provisions of the State Council on the Encouragement of Foreign
Investment;15 · Circular of the State Council Concerning the Adjustment in the Taxation Policy of
Imported Equipment,16 read in conjunction with Section XIII of the Catalogue for the Guidance of Foreign Investment Industries.17
These measures appear to provide such refunds, reductions or exemptions to enterprises in China on the condition that those enterprises purchase domestic over imported goods, or on the condition that those enterprises meet certain export performance criteria. Accordingly, the measures appear to be inconsistent with Article 3 of the SCM Agreement. Furthermore, to the extent the measures accord imported products treatment less favorable than that accorded "like" domestic products, they appear inconsistent with Article III:4 of the GATT 1994 and Article 2 of the TRIMs Agreement. The measures also appear not to comply with China's obligations under paragraphs 7.2-7.3 and 10.3 of Part I of its Accession Protocol,18 as well as paragraph 1.2 of Part I of its Accession Protocol (to the extent that it incorporates paragraphs 167 and 203 of the Report of the Working Party on the Accession of China,19) which forms part of the terms of accession agreed between China and the WTO and is an integral part of the Marrakesh Agreement Establishing the World Trade Organization.
We look forward to receiving your reply to the present request and to fixing a mutually convenient date for consultations.
