CHINA ­ GRANTS, LOANS AND OTHER INCENTIVES
Request to Join Consultations
Communication from the United States
The following communication, dated 2 February 2009, from the delegation of the United States to the delegation of China, the delegation of Guatemala and to the Chairman of the Dispute Settlement Body, is circulated in accordance with Article 4.11 of the DSU.
_______________
This concerns the request for consultations by Guatemala on China ­ Grants, Loans and Other Incentives, circulated on 22 January 2009 (WT/DS390/1). My authorities have instructed me to notify the consulting Members and the Dispute Settlement Body of the desire of the United States to be joined in these consultations, pursuant to Article 4.11 of the Understanding on Rules and Procedures Governing the Settlement of Disputes. The United States has a substantial trade interest in these consultations. They concern certain measures of China offering grants, loans, and other incentives to enterprises in China, measures on which the United States has also requested consultations (WT/DS387/1). These measures appear to offer export subsidies across a broad range of sectors affecting the conditions of competition facing US-produced goods sold in the US and foreign markets.
