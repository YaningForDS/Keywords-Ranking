Communication from the Chairman of the Panel
The following communication, dated 12 April 2002, addressed to the Dispute Settlement Body (DSB), is circulated in accordance with Article 12.9 of the Dispute Settlement Understanding (DSU).
_______________
Article 12.8 of the DSU stipulates that the period in which a panel shall conduct its examination, from the date that the composition and terms of reference of the panel have been agreed upon until the date that the final report is issued to the parties, shall, as a general rule, not exceed six months.
Article 12.9 of the DSU states that, when a panel considers that it cannot issue its report within six months, it shall inform the DSB in writing of the reasons for the delay, together with an estimate of the period within which it will issue its report.
The Panel on "United States ­ Countervailing Duties on Certain Corrosion-Resistant Carbon Steel Flat Products from Germany" was established by the DSB on 10 September 2001 and composed on 26 October 2001.
It will not, however, be possible for the Panel to complete its work within six months due to the parties' wish to use the maximum time periods prescribed in Appendix 3 of the DSU.
The Panel expects to complete its work by July 2002.
