Request to Join Consultations
Communication from Australia
The following communication, dated 13 April 2006, from the delegation of Australia to the delegation of China, the delegation of the European Communities and to the Chairman of the Dispute Settlement Body, is circulated in accordance with Article 4.11 of the DSU.
_______________
Pursuant to paragraph 11 of Article 4 of the Understanding on Rules and Procedures Governing the Settlement of Disputes (DSU), Australia notifies the Government of the People's Republic of China that, in light of the substantial trade interest of Australia, it desires to be joined in the consultations requested by the European Communities in the communication entitled China ­ Measures Affecting Imports of Automobile Parts and circulated to WTO Members on 3 April 2006 (WT/DS339/1).
Australia has substantial trade and commercial interests in this matter. The volume of trade of automobiles and automobile parts between our countries has been increasing significantly. Australia's automotive exports to China increased from about AUD 70 million in 2004 to AUD 284 million in 2005. Approximately 60 per cent of these exports to China consisted of automobile parts, namely engines, brakes and chassis (i.e AUD 114 million worth).
Australia looks forward to receiving your reply.
