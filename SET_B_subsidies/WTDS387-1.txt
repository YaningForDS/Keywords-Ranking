B. The measures referred to in Section A above appear to provide grants, loans, and other incentives to enterprises in China on the condition that those enterprises meet certain export performance criteria. Accordingly, the measures appear to be inconsistent with Article 3 of the SCM Agreement. Additionally, to the extent that these measures provide subsidies for agricultural products, they appear to be inconsistent with Articles 3, 9, and 10 of the Agreement on Agriculture. The measures also appear to be inconsistent with China's obligations under paragraph 12.1 of Part I of its Accession Protocol108, as well as paragraph 1.2 of Part I of its Accession Protocol (to the extent that it incorporates paragraph 234 of the Report of the Working Party on the Accession of China109), which forms part of the terms of accession agreed between China and the WTO and is an integral part of the Marrakesh Agreement Establishing the World Trade Organization. Finally, the grants, loans, and other incentives appear to be inconsistent with Article III:4 of the GATT 1994 to the extent that the measures benefit Chinese-origin products but not imported products.
We look forward to receiving your reply to the present request and to fixing a mutually convenient date for consultations.
