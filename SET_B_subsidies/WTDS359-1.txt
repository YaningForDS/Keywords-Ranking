These measures appear to provide refunds, reductions or exemptions from taxes or other payments ordinarily payable to the Government by enterprises in the PRC on the condition that those enterprises purchase domestic over imported goods, or on the condition that those enterprises meet certain export performance criteria. Accordingly, Mexico considers that these measures are inconsistent with Article 3 of the SCM Agreement. Furthermore, to the extent the measures accord imported products treatment less favourable than that accorded "like" domestic products, they are inconsistent with Article III:4 of the GATT 1994 and Article 2 of the TRIMs Agreement. In Mexico's view, the measures are also inconsistent with the PRC's obligations under paragraphs 7.2, 7.3 and 10.3 of Part I of its Accession Protocol18, as well as paragraph 1.2 of Part I of its Accession Protocol (to the extent that it incorporates paragraphs 167 and 203 of the Report of the Working Party on the Accession of China19), which forms part of the terms of accession agreed between China and the WTO and is an integral part of the Marrakesh Agreement Establishing the World Trade Organization.
Mexico reserves the right to raise further factual and legal claims during the course of the consultations. It looks forward to receiving the PRC Government's response in order to set a mutually convenient date for consultations.
