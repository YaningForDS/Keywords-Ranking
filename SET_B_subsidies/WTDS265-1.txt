EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES ­ EXPORT SUBSIDES ON SUGAR
Request for Consultations by Australia
The following communication, dated 27 September 2002, from the Permanent Mission of Australia to the Permanent Delegation of the European Commission and to the Chairman of the Dispute Settlement Body, is circulated in accordance with Article 4.4 of the DSU.
_______________
My authorities have instructed me to request consultations with the European Communities (EC) pursuant to Article 4 of the Understanding on Rules and Procedures Governing the Settlement of Disputes (DSU), Article XXII:1 of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994 (GATT 1994), Article 19 of the Agreement on Agriculture and Articles 4 and 30 of the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures (SCM Agreement) with respect to the EC's Common Organisation of the Market in sugar and its application and implementation. The measures in question include Council Regulation (EC) 1260/2001 on the common organization of the markets in the sugar sector of 30 June 20011 and measures taken thereunder as well as any amendments thereto or extensions thereof, and any related measures, including measures pre-dating the above Regulation, and their implementation.
The EC provides under the above measures export subsidies in excess of the export subsidy commitments that it has specified in Section II of Part IV of its Schedule of Concessions, in relation to "C sugar" and an amount of 1.6 million tons of sugar per year and possibly also sugar in incorporated products. The EC may also be paying a higher per unit subsidy on incorporated products than on the primary product. In addition, under the EC sugar regime refiners are paid a subsidy, in the form of the intervention price, for refining EC sugar which is not available to imported sugar, thus affording less favourable treatment to imported products.
The regulation and related instruments and measures taken thereunder appear to be inconsistent with the EC's obligations under the provisions of the Agreement on Agriculture, the SCM Agreement and GATT 1994. Specifically, the measures are considered to be inconsistent with the following provisions, at least:
­ Articles 3.3, 8, 9.1, 10.1 and 11 of the Agreement on Agriculture ­ Articles 3.1 and 3.2 of the SCM Agreement ­ Article III:4 and Article XVI of GATT 1994
Australia reserves the right to raise other claims and factual and legal issues during the consultations.
As required under Article 4.2 of the SCM Agreement a Statement of Available Evidence is attached.

I look forward to receiving your reply and to fixing a mutually acceptable date for consultations.
