Request to Join Consultations
Communication from the United States
The following communication, dated 18 October 1996, from the Permanent Mission of the United States to the Permanent Mission of Indonesia, the Permanent Delegation of the European Commission and to the Dispute Settlement Body, is circulated in accordance with Article 4.11 of the DSU.
_______________
Pursuant to paragraph 11 of Article 4 of the Understanding on Rules and Procedures Governing the Settlement of Disputes, the United States Government hereby notifies the Dispute Settlement Body that, in light of the substantial trade interest of the United States, it desires to be joined in the consultations requested by the European Communities in a communication circulated to WTO Members on October 14, 1996 (WT/DS54/1) entitled "Indonesia - Certain Measures Affecting the Automobile Industry".
As a significant exporter of motor vehicles and auto parts to Indonesia, the United States has a substantial trade interest in the matter that is the subject of the EC request. In 1995, the United States exported approximately $59 million worth of motor vehicles and parts to Indonesia, which is indicative of our substantial trade interest.
