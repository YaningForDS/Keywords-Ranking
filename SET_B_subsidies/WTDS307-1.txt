EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES ­ AID FOR COMMERCIAL VESSELS
Request for Consultations by Korea
The following communication, dated 13 February 2004, from the delegation of Korea to the delegation of European Commission and to the Chairman of the Dispute Settlement Body, is circulated in accordance with Article 4.4 of the DSU.
_______________
The Republic of Korea ("Korea") respectfully requests consultations with the European Communities ("EC") and with the EC Member States pursuant to Article 4 of the Understanding on Rules and Procedures Governing the Settlement of Disputes ("DSU"), Article XXIII:1 of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994 ("GATT 1994") and Articles 4, 7 and 30 of the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures ("SCM Agreement") with regard to measures affecting trade in commercial vessels, as elaborated below.
This follows an earlier request for consultations filed by Korea on 3 September 2003 under the same provisions and concerning also measures affecting trade in commercial vessels. Consultations were held on 9 October and 14 November 2003. The consultations held between Korea and the EC related to various EC and Member State measures in relation, inter alia to the following:
i. The provisions of EC Regulation 1177/2002 ("TDM Regulation") and EC Regulation 1540/98 as such, as well as the EC Member States' implementing provisions as such. The above measures provide for subsidies in favour of commercial vessels, whether directly to the shipbuilders or indirect aid, including operating aid, restructuring aid, insolvency and closure aid, aid for regional or other investment, research and development aid and aid for environmental protection;
ii. The EC and its Member States have in particular instances, through federal, regional or local authorities and government-owned or government-controlled financial institutions, provided subsidies in direct or indirect support of commercial vessels built in the EC particularly but not exclusively in the form of (a) operating aid granted on a contractual basis in forms such as grants, export credits, guarantees or tax breaks, (b) restructuring aid, (c) regional or other investment aid, (d) research and development aid, (e) environmental protection aid and (f) insolvency and closure aid.
In the absence of a resolution of the dispute through consultations, on 5 February 2004, Korea requested the establishment of a panel with respect to the TDM Regulation and its inconsistency with certain provisions of the GATT 1994, the SCM Agreement and the DSU. Korea wishes to proceed with consultations with the EC regarding other aspects of the TDM and other measures which were the subject of its September 3rd request along with additional measures recently adopted by the EC. As

WT/DS307/1 G/L/671 G/SCM/D58/1 Page 2
a result, Korea submits this new request for consultations under the provisions referred to hereinabove.
I. The measures concerned
Korea considers that the following EC and Member State measures establish subsidies that are inconsistent with the obligations of the EC and its Member States under the SCM Agreement. These measures include, among others:
i. The provisions of the TDM Regulation, including as extended to cover LNGs by Notice 2003/C 148/10 published on 25 June 2003 (currently proposed to be extended until 31 March 2005 pursuant to European Commission proposal COM(2004)26 final of 21 January 2004). This measure provides for the granting of direct aid in support of contracts for the building of container ships, product tankers, chemical tankers as well as LNG carriers.
ii. The provisions of EC Regulation 1540/98 as such, as well as the EC Member States' implementing provisions as such, to the extent that aid is still being disbursed under these provisions. The above measures provide for subsidies in favour of commercial vessels, whether directly to the shipbuilders or indirect aid, including operating aid, restructuring aid, insolvency and closure aid, aid for regional or other investment, research and development aid and aid for environmental protection.
iii. Based on EC Regulation 1540/98, the EC and Member States have in particular instances, through federal, regional or local authorities and government-owned or government-controlled financial institutions, provided subsidies in direct or indirect support of commercial vessels built in the EC particularly but not exclusively in the form of (a) operating aid granted on a contractual basis in forms such as grants, export credits, guarantees or tax breaks, (b) restructuring aid, (c) regional or other investment aid, (d) research and development aid, (e) environmental protection aid and (f) insolvency and closure aid.
iv. The provisions of the Framework on State Aid to Shipbuilding (Document No 2003/C 317/06 as well as the EC Member States' implementing provisions as such and any individual granting of aid thereunder inasmuch as they provide aid for
a. research, development and innovation in existing shipbuilding, ship repair or ship conversion yards for the industrial application of innovative products and processes;
b. closure aid;
c. employment aid;
d. export credits;
e. development aid and
f. regional aid.
v. The decision by the Spanish Council of Ministers of 6 February 2004 in application of the above Framework to:

WT/DS307/1 G/L/671
G/SCM/D58/1 Page 3
­ allow the Spanish Export Credit Agency (CESCE) to provide State insurance on commercial risks arising from breaches of reimbursement obligations as regards loans granted to OECD shipbuilders for the construction of new ships;
­ the facilitation by the Official Credit Institute (ICO) of the adoption of measures allowing its participation in financial operations related to shipbuilding contracts under conditions equivalent to those of other financial agencies within the EU, in collaboration with the private sector, on the one hand, and to establishment a specific credit line to finance shipbuilding operations for an amount of EURO 300 million on the other hand;
­ the support by the Ministry of Science and Technology of R&D activities in shipbuilding sector for an amount of up to EURO 215 million, as direct aid, and up to EUR 200 million in loans through the National Plan for Scientific Research, Development and Technological Innovation and through the Restructuring fund for the period 2004-2007.
vi. The extension by authorities and financial institutions in the EC Member States, inter alia, in Finland, France, Germany, Italy and The Netherlands of financing and guarantees for the building of commercial vessels subject to a minimum domestic content.
vii. The guarantee by Germany of all obligations of the Kreditanstalt für Wiederaufbau ("KfW" hereinafter) pursuant to Paragraph 1a of the Law on the KfW of 5 November 1948 as last amended by the Law dated 10 December 2003 which also provides a transition period until January 1st, 2008 at the latest for the commercial activities other than promotional activities listed in Paragraph 2(1) to be carried out by an independent legal entity. These activities are carried out by a separate division called "IPEX" since January 1st, 2004 but the Law on the KfW still provides the State guarantee for the commitments of KfW as a whole.
viii. The provision in Germany of public fallback guarantees with respect to credits granted for the financing of ships built in German yards in the five coastal Länder (Niedersachsen, Bremen, Hamburg, Schleswig-Holstein and MecklenburgVorpommern) with differing premia based on six risk categories but seemingly without considering market interest rates for such premia.
ix. By way of example only, specific reference is made to the following:
a. the granting by authorities and financial institutions in France, Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Italy, The Netherlands, Portugal, Spain and the UK of subsidies to beneficiary domestic yards on a vessel-specific and product-related basis;
b. export guarantees scheduled to be granted by the Finnish export guarantee institute, Finnvera in the form of post- and pre-delivery guarantees;
c. the guarantee by the Italian Shipbuilding Guarantee Fund for the recovery of loans for the construction and conversion of ships, granted by banks to Italian and foreign shipowners, for works carried out in Italian shipyards;

WT/DS307/1 G/L/671 G/SCM/D58/1 Page 4
d. the extension by Danish Ship Finance of fixed low-interest, long-term loan facilities to shipowners for the building of new ships at Danish yards;
e. the granting by Spain, through the State holding company, Sociedad Estatal de Participaciones Industriales (SEPI) and Astilleros Espanoles (AESA) ­ a SEPI subsidiary - of restructuring aid through the establishment of the purchase price for publicly held yards Juliana, Cadiz, Astano, Puerta Real, Sestao, Sevilla sold to military shipbuilding group, Bazan, which later changed its name to IZAR below market price as well as through loans and capital injections by SEPI to the previously publicly-held yards and to IZAR;
f. the granting by Spain of research and development subsidies to Spanish shipbuilders;
g. the granting by Spain of loan guarantees to Izar through Spain's industrial holding company;
h. the granting by Spain through the "tax lease scheme" of subsidies in the form of "tax incentives for renewing merchant fleet" indirectly in support of Spanish shipbuilders;
i. the granting by France of subsidies to shipbuilding and industrial group Alstom under the mantle of a rescue plan of at least 2.8 bn euros;
j. the granting by France through a tax lease scheme subsidies for Chantiers de l'Atlantique shipbuilding which also appears to receive subsidies under the TDM;
k. The granting by France of regional aid subsidies to the Loire Region benefiting shipbuilders among others;
l. The granting by the EC Commission of research and development aid with the stated goal of enhancing competitiveness of the shipbuilding industry;
m. The granting by Germany of research and development and investment aid in favour of German shipbuilding.
II. Product coverage of the measures
The subsidies in question were granted directly or indirectly with respect to the production of commercial vessels, including: bulk carriers, container ships, oil tankers, product tankers, chemical tankers, bulk, car and combined carriers as well as general cargo vessels, reefers, LNG/LPG carriers, passenger and RoRo ferries as well as cruise ships, fishing vessels and other non-cargo vessels (including offshore units).
III. Beneficiary EC shipbuilding companies
The EC shipbuilding companies which have directly or indirectly benefited from these subsidies include, but are not limited to, Odense Steel Shipyard, Meyer Werft Shipyard, Kvaerner Masa Yards, the Italian Cantieri T. Mariotti, IZAR, JJ Sietas, Kvaerner Warnow Werft, Aker MTW, Howaldswerke Werft, Lindenau, Chantiers de l'Atlantique, Volharding.

IV. Breach of obligations
Korea considers that the EC and Member State measures in question are in breach of the obligations of the EC and the EC Member States under provisions of the SCM Agreement, GATT 1994 and the DSU. In particular, but not necessarily exclusively of:
· Articles 3.1(a), 1 and 2 of the SCM Agreement, because measures such as for example the export guarantees scheduled to be granted by the Finnish export guarantee institute, Finnvera, in the form of post- and pre-delivery guarantees are specific subsidies within the meaning of Articles 1 and 2 of the SCM Agreement and are de jure export contingent while other measures are de facto export contingent;
· Article 3.1(b), 1 and 2 of the SCM Agreement, because measures providing for the granting of financing or guarantees subject to the use of domestic over imported goods as described Section I.vi above are specific subsidies within the meaning of Articles 1 and 2 of the SCM Agreement and de jure or de facto contingent on a domestic content;
· Articles, 1, 2, 5(a), (b) and (c), 6.3(a),(b) and (c), 6.4 and 6.5 of the SCM Agreement, because in particular but not exclusively the other subsidies referred to in Sections I(i) to (ix) above are specific subsidies within the meaning of Articles 1 and 2 of the SCM Agreement, cause injury to the domestic industry, nullify or impair benefits accruing directly or indirectly to Korea, and cause or threaten to cause serious prejudice to the interests of Korea.
It is considered that the above-described measures nullify or impair benefits accruing to Korea under the WTO Agreements, within the meaning of Article XXIII:1(a) and (b) of the GATT 1994. The Government of Korea reserves the right to address additional measures and claims under other WTO provisions during the course of the consultations, taking into account in particular that the EC is proposing to extend the period of validity of Regulation 1177/2002, EC Member States may still adopt or implement subsidy schemes pursuant to Regulation 1177/2002 and EC Member States are still in the process of adopting or implementing measures in accordance with the EC Framework on State aid to shipbuilding.
Korea notes that Annex I contains a list of information available at this time. Korea would like to incorporate the information contained in Annex I into this request for consultation by reference.
Korea notes that consultations on a number of the topics were held pursuant to the 3 September 2003 request. A number of inquiries pursuant to those consultations remain outstanding. Korea hopes that those consultations can continue without undue repetition and include the additional items noted above pursuant to this request for consultations. Accordingly, Korea looks forward to receiving the response of the EC to the present request and to setting a mutually convenient date and place to hold consultations.
A copy of this request is being sent to the Chairman of the Dispute Settlement Body and to the Chairman of the Council for Trade in Goods and the Chairman of the Committee on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures.
