KOREA ­ MEASURES AFFECTING TRADE IN COMMERCIAL VESSELS
Communication from the European Communities
The following communication, dated 10 July 2003, from the Permanent Delegation of the European Commission to the Dispute Settlement Body, is circulated at the request of that delegation.
__________
The European Communities asks that the request for the establishment of a Panel in the above dispute (WT/DS273/2) be placed on the agenda for the next meeting of the Dispute Settlement Body, which is scheduled to take place on 21 July 2003 and that the DSB, at that meeting, establishes the Panel.
The European Communities further requests that the DSB at that meeting initiate the procedures provided for in Annex V of the SCM Agreement pursuant to paragraph 2 of that Annex. In accordance with these procedures, the DSB is required to designate a representative to serve the function of facilitating the information-gathering process needed by the parties and the panel. In order to facilitate the task of the DSB to designate its representative pursuant to paragraph 4 of Annex V of the SCM Agreement, the European Communities has proposed names and has consulted with Korea. However, in the absence of an agreement with Korea, the European Communities request that the DSB designate a representative to serve the function of facilitating the informationgathering process of Annex V.
Furthermore, the European Communities would like to indicate, in conformity with paragraphs 1 and 3 of Annex V, that the market considered relevant by the European Communities is the world market. In order to obtain sufficiently representative data to resolve this dispute while at the same time avoiding unnecessary burdens on other WTO Members, the European Communities intends to address questions under the Annex V procedure to the following third-country Members:
­ Japan ­ China
The European Communities would also like to inform the DSB that the organization responsible for administration of this provision within its territory is the Directorate General for Trade of the European Commission, Rue de la Loi 200, 1049 Brussels, Belgium. The European Communities would ask that information pursuant to the Annex V procedures be provided in writing and, if possible, in electronic format to the Delegation of the European Commission in Geneva.
