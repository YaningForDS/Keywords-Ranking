UNITED STATES ­ CUSTOMS BOND DIRECTIVE FOR MERCHANDISE SUBJECT TO ANTI-DUMPING/COUNTERVAILING DUTIES
Request to Join Consultations
Communication from Brazil
The following communication, dated 21 June 2006, from the delegation of Brazil to the delegation of the United States, the delegation of India and to the Chairman of the Dispute Settlement Body, is circulated in accordance with Article 4.11 of the DSU.
_______________
With reference to the request by India for consultations with the United States concerning United States -- Customs Bond Directive for Merchandise Subject to Anti-Dumping/Countervailing Duties (WT/DS345/1, circulated on 12 June 2006), I hereby wish to convey the request of the Government of Brazil, pursuant to Article 4.11 of the Understanding on Rules and Procedures Governing the Settlement of Disputes ("DSU"), to join in these consultations.
Brazil has a substantial trade interest in the issues under consultation. As explained in India's request, the United States, pursuant to the "Amended Bond Directive", has imposed the enhanced bond requirement on importers of frozen warm water shrimp from certain countries, including Brazil. Brazil has been one of the main exporters of shrimp to the United States. As a consequence of the imposition of the measure at issue, Brazilian exports of the product ­ which responded for approximately 45% of total exports of shrimp ­ have been seriously affected.
Brazil would appreciate being informed of the date and venue of consultations.
