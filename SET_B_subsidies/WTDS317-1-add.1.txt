UNITED STATES ­ MEASURES AFFECTING TRADE IN LARGE CIVIL AIRCRAFT
Request for Consultations by the European Communities
Addendum
The following communication, dated 27 June 2005, from the delegation of the European Communities to the delegation of the United States and to the Chairman of the Dispute Settlement Body, is circulated in accordance with Article 4.4 of the DSU.
_______________
The European Communities refers to the United States' statement at the meeting of the Dispute Settlement Body ("DSB") on 13 June concerning the European Communities' request for the establishment of a Panel in the above case, where you asserted that 13 of the 28 subsidy programs referenced in the panel request were not listed in the consultation request of 6 October 2004 (circulated as document WT/DS/317/1 on 12 October 2004) and cannot be the subject of panel proceedings.
The European Communities cannot agree with this contention but is prepared to pursue consultations on the issues raised in these proceedings in order to clarify and, if possible, resolve them, it being understood that this is without prejudice to the European Communities' legal position and rights.
Accordingly, the European Communities hereby requests consultations with the United States pursuant to Articles 4.1, 7.1 and 30 of the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures ("SCM Agreement"), Article XXIII:1 of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994 ("GATT 1994") and Article 4 of the Understanding on Rules and Procedures Governing the Settlement of Disputes ("DSU"). These consultations will be a continuation of those held on 5 November 2004 pursuant to the request for consultations of 6 October 2004.
The measures that are the subject of this request are prohibited and actionable subsidies provided to US producers of large civil aircraft1 ("US LCA industry"), and in particular the Boeing Company and the McDonnell Douglas Corporation, prior to its merger with Boeing, including related
1 In accordance with the 1992 Agreement between the European Communities and the Government of the United States of America concerning the application of the GATT Agreement on Trade in Civil Aircraft on trade in large civil aircraft, large civil aircraft ("LCA") includes all aircraft as defined in Article 1 of the GATT Agreement on Trade in Civil Aircraft, except engines as defined in Article 1.1(b) thereof, that are designed for passenger or cargo transportation and have 100 or more passenger seats or its equivalent in cargo configuration. Boeing produces or markets the following families of LCA: 717, 737, 747, 757, 767, 777, and 787.

legislation, regulations, statutory instruments and amendments thereto. The measures currently include the following:
1. STATE AND LOCAL SUBSIDIES
US States and local authorities, where production and headquarter facilities of the US LCA industry are located, transfer in various ways economic resources to the US LCA industry. Such States and local authorities include, but are not limited to, those in the States of Washington, Kansas and Illinois.
These economic resources transferred to the US LCA industry include numerous financial incentives and other advantages effectuated, for example, through tax breaks, bond financing, fee waivers, lease arrangements, corporate headquarters relocation assistance, research funding, infrastructure measures and other benefits.
2. NASA SUBSIDIES
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration ("NASA") transfers economic resources to the US LCA industry, inter alia, by:
(i) allowing the US LCA industry to participate in research programmes, making payments to the US LCA industry under those programmes, or enabling the US LCA industry to exploit the results thereof by means including but not limited to the foregoing or waiving of valuable patent rights, the granting of limited exclusive rights data ("LERD"), or otherwise exclusive or early access to data, trade secrets and other knowledge resulting from government funded research. The following are examples of such NASA programmes:
· High Speed Research Program; · Advanced Subsonic Technology Program; · Aviation Safety Program/Aviation Safety & Security Program/Aviation Security &
Safety Program; · Quiet Aircraft Technology Program; · High Performance Computing and Communications Program; · Research & Technology Base Program; · Advanced Composites Technology Program; · Vehicle Systems Program; · Materials and Structures Systems Technology Program; · Aircraft Energy Efficiency Program, including Composite Primary Aircraft

G/SCM/D63/1/Add.1 Page 3
3. DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE SUBSIDIES
The Department of Defense ("DOD") transfers economic resources to the US LCA industry, inter alia, by:
(i) allowing the US LCA industry to participate in DOD-funded research, making payments to the US LCA industry for such research, or enabling the US LCA industry to exploit the results thereof by means including but not limited to the foregoing or waiving of valuable patent rights, and the granting of exclusive or early access to data, trade secrets and other knowledge resulting from government funded research, through, for example:
· Research, Development, Testing and Evaluation Programs; · Independent Research & Development, and Bid & Proposal Reimbursements;
(ii) use by the US LCA industry of test and evaluation facilities owned by the US Government, including the Major Range Test Facility Bases;
(iii) procurement contracts including those for the purchase of goods from the US LCA industry for more than adequate remuneration, including in particular but not limited to the US Air Force contract with the Boeing corporation for the purchase of certain spare parts for its Airborne Warning and Control System (AWACS) aircraft, the Boeing KC-767A Tanker Program (lease contract), the National Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System-Conical Microwave Imager Sensor, Boeing, the C-22 Replacement Program (C-40), Boeing, the KC-135 Programmed Depot Maintenance, Boeing/Pemco, the C-40 Lease and Purchase Program, Boeing, the C-130 avionics modernisation upgrade program, the C-17 H22 contract (Boeing BC-17X) and the US Navy contract with Boeing for the production and maintenance of 108 civil B-737 and their conversion into long-range submarine hunter MultiMission Aircraft.
The EC is also concerned about pending legislation, in particular draft amendment (Section 817 ­ Prohibition on Procurement from Beneficiaries of Foreign Subsidies) to the FY06 Defense Authorisation bill (HR 1815) (Hunter Amendment).
4. DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE SUBSIDIES
The Department of Commerce ("DOC") transfers economic resources to the US LCA industry, inter alia, by allowing the US LCA industry to participate in the National Institute of Standards & Technology ("NIST") Advanced Technology Program, making payments to the US LCA industry under this research programme, or enabling the US LCA industry to exploit the results thereof by means including but not limited to the foregoing or waiving of valuable patent rights, the granting of exclusive or early access to data, trade secrets and other knowledge resulting from government funded research.
5. DEPARTMENT OF LABOR SUBSIDIES

WT/DS317/1/Add.1 G/L/698/Add.1 G/SCM/D63/1/Add.1 Page 4
6. FEDERAL TAX SUBSIDIES
The US Government transfers economic resources to the US LCA industry through the federal tax system, and in particular the following tax measures:
Sections 921-927 of the Internal Revenue Code (prior to repeal) and related measures establishing special tax treatment for "Foreign Sales Corporations" ("FSCs"), including individual applications; the FSC Repeal and Extraterritorial Income Exclusion Act of 2000, Pub. L. No. 106-519, including individual applications; and the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, Pub. L. No. 108-357 including individual applications.
The European Communities considers that these measures are inconsistent with the obligations of the United States under the following provisions:
(1) Articles 3.1 (a) and (b) and 3.2 of the SCM Agreement;
(2) Article 5 (a) and (c) of the SCM Agreement;
(3) Article 6.3 (a), (b), and (c) of the SCM Agreement;
(4) Article III:4 of the GATT 1994.
The European Communities is of the view that the measures referred to above are inconsistent with these provisions as such and as applied.
These measures are subsidies because in each instance there is a financial contribution by the US, State or local government and a benefit is thereby conferred within the meaning of Article 1.1(a) and (b) of the SCM Agreement. Each of them is specific to the US LCA industry within the meaning of Article 2 of the SCM Agreement.
The subsidies listed above are de jure or de facto export contingent, and contingent on the use of domestic over imported goods. The use of these measures causes adverse effects, in particular, serious prejudice or a threat of serious prejudice to the interests of the European Communities and material injury or threat of material injury to the European Community LCA industry:
­ The effect of the measures is significant price undercutting by subsidized products of the US LCA industry as compared with the price of the European Community LCA products, or a threat thereof in violation of Articles 5(c) and 6.3(c) of the SCM Agreement;
­ The effect of the measures is significant price depression and price suppression in the markets for LCA products or a threat thereof in violation of Articles 5(c) and 6.3(c) of the SCM Agreement;
­ The effect of the measures is significant lost sales in the markets for LCA products or a threat thereof in violation of Articles 5(c) and 6.3(c) of the SCM Agreement;
­ The effect of the measures is to displace or impede exports of European Community LCA products in the US market or a threat thereof in violation of Articles 5(c) and 6.3(a) of the SCM Agreement;

WT/DS317/1/Add.1 G/L/698/Add.1
G/SCM/D63/1/Add.1 Page 5
­ The effect of the measures is to displace or impede exports of European Community LCA products in third country markets or a threat thereof in violation of Articles 5(c) and 6.3(b) of the SCM Agreement;
­ The effect of the measures is material injury to the European Community LCA industry or a threat thereof in violation of Article 5(a) of the SCM Agreement.
­ The Hunter Amendment would also be incompatible, inter alia, with Article 23 of the DSU and Article 32 of the SCM Agreement.
Articles 4.2 and 7.2 of the SCM Agreement together require that requests for consultations include a statement of available evidence with regard to: (1) the existence and nature of the subsidies in question, and (2) the adverse effects to the interests of the European Communities. The available evidence is listed in the Annex to this letter. It combines the available evidence already contained in the letter of 6 October 2004 and additional evidence on the existence and nature of the subsidies that has become available since then.
The European Communities reserves the right to request the United States to produce further information and documents regarding the measures in question and their effect on the interests of the European Communities. The European Communities also reserves the right to address additional measures and claims under other WTO provisions.
My authorities look forward to receiving in due course a reply from the United States to this request. The European Communities is ready to consider with the United States mutually convenient dates to hold consultations in Geneva.
