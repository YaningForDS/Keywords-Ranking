JAPAN ­ COUNTERVAILING DUTIES ON DYNAMIC RANDOM ACCESS MEMORIES FROM KOREA
Request to Join Consultations
Communication from the United States
The following communication, dated 27 March 2006, from the delegation of the United States to the delegation of Japan, the delegation of Korea and to the Chairman of the Dispute Settlement Body, is circulated in accordance with Article 4.11 of the DSU.
_______________
The United States refers to the request by the Government of Korea ("Korea") for consultations with the Government of Japan ("Japan") pursuant to Article 4 of the Understanding on Rules and Procedures Governing the Settlement of Disputes ("DSU"), Article 30 of the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures, and Article XXII of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994, with regard to the imposition of countervailing duties by Japan on imports of certain Dynamic Random Access Memories ("DRAMS") from Korea. Korea's request is set forth in WT/DS336/1 (20 March 2006). My authorities have instructed me to notify Japan that the United States desires to be joined in the consultations requested by Korea.
The United States notes that it also has imposed a countervailing duty order on Dynamic Random Access Memory Semiconductors from the Republic of Korea, and that both Japan's measure and the US measure appear to be the result of Korea's subsidization of Hynix, a Korean producer of DRAMS.
The United States looks forward to receiving your reply.
