_______________
My authorities have instructed me to request, pursuant to Article 4.11 of the WTO Understanding on the Settlement of Disputes, that we be joined in the consultations requested by Brazil on 11 July last. Brazil's request was circulated to Members on 17 July 2007 and the consultations concern "domestic support and export credit guarantees for agricultural products" granted by the United States in 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2004 and 2005, as detailed in the abovementioned request.
As an importer of agricultural products from the United States subject to the measures identified by Brazil, Mexico has a substantial trade interest in this matter, and would accordingly be most grateful for a favourable response hereto.
