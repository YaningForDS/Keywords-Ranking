Article 12.8 of the DSU stipulates that the period in which a panel shall conduct its examination, from the date that the composition and terms of reference of the panel have been agreed upon until the date that the final report is issued to the parties, shall, as a general rule, not exceed six months.
Article 12.9 of the DSU states that, when a panel considers that it cannot issue its report within six months, it shall inform the Dispute Settlement Body ("DSB") in writing of the reasons for the delay, together with an estimate of the period within which it will issue its report.
The Panel on United States ­ Measures Relating to Shrimp from Thailand (DS343) was established by the DSB on 26 October 2006 and the Panel on United States ­ Customs Bond Directive for Merchandise Subject to Anti-Dumping/Countervailing Duties (DS345) was established by the DSB on 21 November 2006. Pursuant to Article 8.7 of the DSU, Thailand and India requested the Director-General, on 19 January 2007, to determine the composition of the Panels. In accordance with Article 9.3 of the DSU, the same persons served on each of the above-mentioned Panels. The Panels were composed on 26 January 2007.
It will not be possible for the Panels to complete their work within six months of the date of composition, inter alia, due to the nature and scope of the disputes.
