ANNEX I-21

COMMENTS OF THE UNITED STATES TO THE 11 FEBRUARY 2004 ANSWERS OF BRAZIL TO PANEL QUESTION 276
18 February 2004
Question 276. "The Panel notes the parties' responses and comments relating to Question No. 252 concerning the time period within which any prohibited measure must be withdrawn within the meaning of Article 4.7 of the SCM Agreement. Please supplement your original response, taking into account the particular nature of each alleged prohibited subsidy measure (i.e. "Step 2" payments under Section 1207(a) of the 2002 FSRI Act, export credit guarantee programmes and the ETI Act) and the functioning of the US legal and regulatory system in respect of these measures."
1. The United States appreciates this opportunity to comment on the response of Brazil to Panel question 276, posed on 3 February 2004. As an initial matter, the United States notes that the question poses a hypothetical situation: that any of the measures at issue in this dispute might be found to be a prohibited subsidy. The United States of course has explained that Brazil has not shown that any of the measures at issue is a prohibited subsidy. That being said, the United States offers the following comments on Brazil's response.
2. Of note, in its response Brazil has recognized that its previous answer to Question 252 from the Panel was inadequate. In full, that answer provided: "Brazil suggests that the Panel follow the precedent of all previous WTO panels that made findings of prohibited subsidies and specify that the measure must be withdrawn within 90 days."1 Brazil has now revised ­ from 90 days to six months ­ its recommendation to the Panel of the time period that would constitute withdrawing "without delay" subsidies allegedly provided by the export credit guarantee programmes. However, Brazil's response sets out a faulty analysis of the meaning of "without delay" in Article 4.7 as applied in previous reports and therefore identifies what would be inappropriately short time periods for withdrawal of the measures at issue if they were prohibited subsidies, which they are not.
3. Article 4.7 of the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures ("Subsidies Agreement") establishes that "[i]f the measure in question is found to be a prohibited subsidy, the panel shall recommend that the subsidizing Member withdraw the subsidy without delay. In this regard, the panel shall specify in its recommendation the time-period within which the measure must be withdrawn". The Agreement does not further define "without delay", although Brazil concedes that the "text [of Article 4.7] does not state `immediately'".2
4. Past panels have dealt with the meaning of the term "without delay," and have concluded that this involves an examination of the nature of the changes to be effected and the domestic legal process involved. For example, in Canada ­ Certain Measures Affecting the Automotive Industry, the panel found that "in examining what time-period would represent withdrawal `without delay' in a particular case, we consider that we may take into account the nature of the steps necessary to withdraw the prohibited subsidy".3 Similarly, in Australia ­ Subsidies Provided to Producers and Exporters of

Automotive Leather4, the panel found that "the nature of the measures and issues regarding implementation might be relevant" to the time period for withdrawal of the subsidies".5
5. The analysis by these panels is similar to that undertaken by arbitrators under Article 21.3 of the Understanding on Rules and Procedures Governing the Settlement of Disputes ("DSU") in considering the period of time for a Member to implement DSB recommendations and rulings. There, arbitrators have also considered that Article 21.3 calls for an analysis of the nature of the changes to be effected and "the shortest period possible within the legal system of the Member to implement the recommendations and rulings of the DSB".6 Thus, in practical terms, the "reasonable period of time" standard of DSU Article 21.3 has been interpreted to mean something akin to without "delay" ("procrastination; lingering; putting off"7).
6. DSU Article 21.3 is part of the context of Article 4.7. Brazil attempts to distinguish Article 4.7 of the Subsidies Agreement from Article 21.3 of the DSU.8 However, Brazil argues that a key difference is that Article 21.3 uses the term "reasonable". Brazil thus appears to argue that under Article 4.7 any time period specified should not be reasonable. The United States agrees that there are differences between Article 4.7 of the Subsidies Agreement and Article 21.3 of the DSU. But those differences do not amount to a requirement that panels require unreasonable actions. Rather, one key difference is that DSU Article 21.3(c) provides arbitrators with a "guideline" that the "reasonable period of time" to implement panel or Appellate Body recommendations "should not exceed 15 months from the date of adoption of a panel or Appellate Body report" whereas Article 4.7 does not.9
7. In the current dispute, the measures at issue all involve legislation and any change would require legislative action. Brazil has proposed that withdrawal "without delay" should be considered to mean withdrawal within 90 days for allegedly prohibited subsidies under the Step 2 programme and the ETI Act and withdrawal within 6 months for alleged export subsidies under the export credit guarantee programmes. However, Brazil's proposed time periods are not supported by considerations relating to the nature of the measures at issue nor the US legislative process that would be necessary to effect changes to those measures.
8. Specifically, Brazil concedes that statutory changes would be necessary to withdraw the allegedly prohibited subsidies at issue in this dispute.10 However, the panel reports Brazil cites as
4 WT/DS126/R, paras. 10.4-10.7 (adopted 16 June 1999). 5 See also the panel reports in the Aircraft disputes between Canada and Brazil, in which the panels took into account the nature of the measures and the procedures which may be required to implement the panels' recommendations. 6 Report of the Arbitrator, United States ­ Continued Dumping and Subsidy Offset Act of 2000, WT/DS217/14, WT/DS234/22, para. 42 (13 June 2003) (quotation marks and footnote omitted) (citing 3 previous reports of arbitrators). 7 The New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary, vol. 1, at 623 (1993 ed.). 8 Brazil's response to Question 276, para. 2. 9 In the earliest arbitrations under Article 21.3(c), arbitrators viewed the guideline as meaning that each party bore the burden of proof that the reasonable period of time should depart from the 15 months period, which would be a significant difference from Article 4.7. That approach has now evolved into the practice described above of the shortest possible period of time within the legal system of the Member to implement the recommendations and rulings of the DSB. 10 Brazil's Answer to Question 276 from the Panel, para. 10 (11 February 2004) (eliminating Step 2 "simply requires the repeal of Section 1207(a) of the 2002 FSRI Act); id., para. 11 (for export credit guarantee programmes, "the prohibited subsidies must be withdrawn by enacting the necessary changes to the statutes and regulations providing for GSM102, GSM 103, and SCGP"); id., para. 12 (90 days "represents an appropriate period of time . . . to withdraw the ETI Act").

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-730
support for the proposition that "without delay" generally means 90 days dealt with subsidies that required only executive or administrative action to withdraw:11
In Canada ­ Certain Measures Affecting the Automotive Industry, the panel found: "we note that the [challenged measures] are both Orders-in-Council, and as such are acts of the executive, and not the legislative branch of government. The amendment of an act of the executive branch can normally be effectuated more quickly than would be the case if legislative action were required."12 The report further notes that "in those disputes involving a prohibited subsidy in which legislative action was not required, panels have specified a time-period of 90 days".13
In Australia ­ Subsidies Provided to Producers and Exporters of Automotive Leather,14 taking into account that the dispute involved payments made under a grant contract between the Australian Government and a private company, the panel recommended that the measures be withdrawn within 90 days.
In Canada ­ Export Credits and Loan Guarantees for Regional Aircraft,15 involving executive action concerning financing provided by Canada for particular transactions, the panel found that "Canada should withdraw the export subsidies within 90 days ("without delay").
In Brazil ­ Export Financing Programme for Aircraft, with respect to payments under the interest rate equalization component of PROEX,16 the panel report found that, "taking into account the nature of the measures and the procedures which may be required to implement our recommendation," Brazil should withdraw the measures within 90 days.17
In Canada ­ Measures Affecting the Export of Civilian Aircraft,18 with respect to certain executive action concerning financing and funds provided to the Canadian civil aircraft industry, the panel report found that, "[t]aking into account the procedures that may be required to implement our recommendation", Canada should withdraw the measures within 90 days.
Thus, in every panel report in which the "without delay" time period has been set as 90 days, only executive action (and not statutory amendment) has been necessary. Thus, these reports offer little guidance to the Panel, other than to indicate that 90 days would not be an adequate time period, given that Brazil recognizes that legislation would be required to modify the measures in dispute.
9. Brazil notes, almost in passing, that "[t]here is only one precedent applying the Article 4.7 `without delay' provision to prohibited subsidy measures requiring legislative changes"19: the panel

report in United States ­ FSC.20 However, Brazil fails to quote or discuss that panel report's discussion of the "without delay" language, which would seem to be particularly relevant given that Brazil has challenged the ETI Act ­ the successor to the FSC programme ­ in this dispute. Brazil erroneously cites this report as supporting the proposition that "without delay" generally means withdrawal within 90 days21, but there is no discussion of a 90-day period in the report.
10. Upon finding that the FSC scheme provided export subsidies inconsistent with Article 3.1(a) of the Subsidies Agreement, the FSC panel first recommended, "pursuant to Article 4.7 of that Agreement, that the DSB request the United States to withdraw the FSC subsidies without delay".22 The panel examined what should be its recommendation with respect to the time-period within which the measure must be withdrawn. The panel noted that the time period specified "must be consistent with the requirement that the subsidy be withdrawn `without delay'". The panel then went on to find, and recommend:
Given that the implementation of the Panel's recommendation will require legislative action (a fact recognized by the European Communities), that the United States fiscal year 2000 starts on 1 October 1999, and that this report is not scheduled for circulation to Members until September 1999 (and, if appealed, might not be adopted until as late as early spring 2000), it is not in our view a practical possibility that the United States could be in a position to take the necessary legislative action by 1 October 1999. That being so, and acting in good faith, there is no way that this could be described as a `delay.' However, this objective timing constraint would not be present with effect from the following fiscal year (2001), which commences on 1 October 2000. As this would be the first practicable date by which the United States could implement our recommendation, it satisfies the `without delay' standard found in Article 4.7. Accordingly, we specify that FSC subsidies must be withdrawn at the latest with effect from 1 October 2000.23
Brazil recognizes that statutory changes would be necessary to modify the measures at issue in this dispute. However, Brazil fails to discuss the various considerations identified by the FSC panel report, such as the potential date of circulation of the Panel's report and the effect of appeal on the timing of adoption. Neither does Brazil discuss whether there would be a "practical possibility" of legislative action within its suggested time periods.
11. With respect to the potential date of circulation, the Panel's current schedule provides for the final report to be issued to the parties on 19 May. Circulation to all Members would be upon translation into the official WTO languages. Conservatively assuming one month for completion of translation of what may be a very lengthy panel report, the report would be circulated in mid-June. Panel reports may not be considered for adoption until 20 days after they have been circulated to all Members24 ­ approximately early July. If the Panel report is appealed, the Appellate Body report will likely be issued 90 days from the notice of appeal25 ­ approximately early October. The Appellate Body report would be adopted (unless the DSB decides by consensus not to adopt it) within 30 days of circulation26 ­ approximately early November.

12. The current US Congress is scheduled to adjourn on 1 October 2004. Accordingly, no legislative action would be possible until after the new Congress convenes in 2005 and organizes itself. The United States has previously stated that, in the event of a prohibited subsidy finding, it should be given until the end of "this year" to complete the legislative process. However, given the probable time line for this dispute noted above, that is not a possibility.
13. Once the new Congress convenes and organizes (a process that we would not expect to be completed before mid-February), any legislation would then need to proceed through the legislative process. In the United States, this involves the following.27
The US Legislative Process
14. Under the United States system of constitutional government, any changes to a federal statute must be enacted by the US Congress, which sets its own procedures and timetable. The Executive branch of the US Government has no control over these procedures and timetable. Securing the enactment of legislation in the US Congress is a complex and lengthy process. Moreover, only a small fraction of the thousands of bills introduced in each Congress ever become law. This indicates that the process of obtaining the votes necessary to enact legislation is difficult and time-consuming. Viewed in this light, there is no "practical possibility" that this process will take, as Brazil suggests, 3 months for the Step 2 programme and ETI Act and 6 months (including time for administrative action) for the export credit guarantee programmes.
15. The power to legislate is vested in the United States Congress, which has two chambers, the House of Representatives and the Senate. Both chambers must approve all legislation in identical form, before it is sent to the President of the United States for signature or other action. Only after presidential approval does proposed legislation become law. Proposed legislation that will become public law usually takes the form of a "bill". From the time that a bill is introduced in Congress to the time that it is approved by both chambers, it will have passed through at least ten steps. These ten steps include: (1) the bill is introduced in the House of Representatives or the Senate by a member of Congress; (2) the bill is referred to a standing committee or committees having jurisdiction over the subject matter of the bills, which may also refer the proposed legislation to various subcommittees; (3) the merits of the bill are considered by a subcommittee, which may include public hearings; (4) when hearings are completed, the subcommittee meets to "mark-up" the bill (make changes and amendments) prior to deciding whether to recommend (or "report") the bill to the full committee; (5) the full committee (considering the subcommittee's report) may conduct further study and hearings and then votes whether to report the bill, either as originally introduced without amendment, or as revised, to the full House; (6) the House considers the bill on its merits and, after voting on amendments, the House immediately votes on the bill itself with any adopted amendments; (7) if the bill is passed, the bill must be referred to the Senate, which, following its own legislative process and consideration, may approve the bill as received, reject it, ignore it, or change it; (8) if the Senate amends the bill or passes its own similar but not identical legislation, a conference committee is organized to reconcile differences between the House and Senate versions; (9) if the committee reaches agreement on a single bill, a "conference report" must be approved by both chambers, in identical form, or the revised legislation dies; and (10) after the bill proposed by the conference committee is approved by both chambers, it is sent to the President for approval. Most bills that are introduced do not survive this process to become law, and those that do are likely to have been significantly amended along the way.
27 A more detailed description of the US legislative process may be found in paragraphs 21-35 of the Submission of the United States in the Arbitration under Article 21.3(c) of the DSU in the dispute United States ­ Continued Dumping and Subsidy Offset Act of 2000, WT/DS217 & 234 (13 April 2003) (available at http://www.ustr.gov/enforcement/briefs.shtml).

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-733
16. In addition, Brazil has recognized that a finding that the programmes are prohibited export subsidies would necessarily require "changes to the statutes and regulations" providing for the programmes.28 The regulatory changes could not be made until after the legislative changes are finalized. Thus, the time period that would constitute withdrawal "without delay" would have to allow for both legislative and regulatory changes. 17. No panel report considering Article 4.7 has ever awarded a period of less than three months. Moreover, panels have found that "[t]he amendment of an act of the executive branch can normally be effectuated more quickly than would be the case if legislative action were required".29 18. Indeed, in a recent arbitration under DSU Article 21.3(c) in a dispute where compliance by the United States involved both legislative and regulatory action, the arbitrator concluded that 15 months was the reasonable period of time for implementation.30 19. In light of the foregoing considerations, under the hypothetical situation that any of the measures at issue would be a prohibited subsidy, the United States suggests that a panel recommendation that the measure be withdrawn 15 months after adoption of the DSB recommendations and rulings would be "without delay" in the circumstances of this dispute.

1. Introduction
1. Brazil sets forth its response to the US 11 February 2004 Comments on Brazil's 28 January Comments and Requests regarding the US Data ("US 11 February 2004 Comments"). Brazil demonstrates in Sections 2 and 3 that the US critique of any methodology for tabulating "support to a specific commodity" is based on (1) a faulty legal interpretation that only subsidies tied to the production of a specific commodity can be counted for the purposes of Article 13(b)(ii) of the Agreement on Agriculture, and (2) a faulty factual assumption that the non-green box US contract payments did not provide support to maintain US production of upland cotton between MY 19992002. In Section 5, Brazil responds to the US 11 February 2004 Comments by demonstrating that applying Brazil's and the US methodologies (along with two slight variations thereof) to the incomplete and inadequate US summary data (including the most recent 28 January 2004 data) demonstrates that the US budgetary expenditures in MY 1999-2002 exceed the level of support decided in MY 1992. Finally, Brazil responds to a number of other points raised by the US 11 February 2004 Comments in Sections 4, and 6-10.
2. The US Critique of Brazil's Methodology Is Based on the Flawed US Interpretation of "Support to a Specific Commodity" and, Alternatively, "Non-Product Specific Support"
2. The United States' 11 February 2004 Comments challenging Brazil's methodology for counting contract payments are premised on a faulty interpretation of Article 13(b)(ii) of the Agreement on Agriculture. The US comments continue the US interpretation that the Panel can only count as "support" in MY 2002 those non-green box subsidies that require the production of upland cotton.1 But this leaves behind a number of subsidies that significantly and directly support production of upland cotton. As Brazil has previously argued, the Panel is required to count under Article 13(b)(ii) as "support to upland cotton" for MY 1999-2002 all identifiable non-green box support to upland cotton that supports, either directly or indirectly, the production or sale of upland cotton.2
2.1 US 11 February 2004 Comments Improperly Interpret the Phrase "Support to a Specific Commodity"
3. The United States argues that no allocation methodology can be applied by the Panel under Article 13(b)(ii) of the Agreement on Agriculture. This US argument is based on the US 11 February 2004 Comments that "support to" means support "tied to" the production of a specific commodity.3 In evaluating this argument the Panel should examine the ordinary meaning of the phrase "support to a specific commodity" in Article 13(b)(ii). The word "support" is defined as "the action of preventing a person from giving way or of backing-up a person or group; assistance, backing".4 "Support" does not mean or require, as the US comments suggest, an "incentive" or "encouragement" to produce. The SCM Agreement Annex IV, paragraph 3 phrase "tied to the production or sale of a [specific commodity]" is not found in Article 13(b)(ii). Rather, the word "support" has a more general sense of "backing up" a group of agricultural farmers producing a specific commodity. For example, subsidies that cover costs of production when a farmer chooses to grow a crop, "back up" or "support" that farmer. While some non-green box subsidies at issue in this dispute may create a greater incentive to produce (i.e., marketing loan, counter-cyclical payments, or crop insurance subsidies) than other subsidies (PFC or direct payments), all of these subsidies at issue in this dispute "support" production of upland cotton because they cover (or contribute to) the costs of production of a crop.

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-737
4. The distinction between "support for production" and "incentive for" (or "tied to") production becomes relevant only when examining the effects these subsidies have in causing serious prejudice, within the meaning of Part III of the SCM Agreement. Brazil and the United States agree that the contract payments, which do not require production, create less direct incentives to produce than, e.g., marketing loan payments, Step 2 payments and crop insurance subsidies. But it is improper to impose an "incentive to" or "tied to" production test when counting up the non-green box "support" to a specific commodity under Article 13(b)(ii) of the Agreement on Agriculture. As noted above, the meaning of the phrase "support to" is a far broader concept. Indeed, the chapeau of Article 13(b)(ii) confirms this broader meaning of "support," because it includes all types of non-green box measures, without regard to whether they create direct production incentives.
5. The United States' comments continue to repeat the flawed mantra that "support to a specific commodity" means exactly the same thing as "product-specific support".5 Negotiators presumably knew what they intended when they used the very particular term "product-specific support". They used the term repeatedly in the Agreement on Agriculture, and even defined "non-product-specific support" in Article 1(a) ­ yet they declined to use "product-specific support" in Article 13(b)(ii). Accepting arguendo the US narrow interpretation of "product-specific"6, one reason may be that the "support to a specific commodity" phrase was not intended to mean only support that is tied to one product, but rather is intended to include all support that is provided, either directly or indirectly, to a product. The term "specific" clarifies that Article 13(b)(ii) focuses on any support to an individual commodity, not a group of commodities such as "grains"7 or even all commodities. In fact, the notion of a "specific commodity" is very analogous to the "like product" in, inter alia, Articles 5 and 6 of the SCM Agreement and Article XVI of GATT 1994 ­ provisions that are expressly referenced in Article 13(b)(ii) of the Agreement on Agriculture.
6. The United States argues that the Panel is prohibited from even including as "support to" upland cotton, let alone applying any allocation methodology to, any non-green box domestic support measure.8 This would be true even where a measure may provide billions of dollars of support to producers of a "specific commodity". This, of course, is based on the US view that only support directly tied to the production of a specific product is covered by Article 13(b)(ii).9 But because Article 13(b)(ii) captures all non-green box domestic subsidies that support a commodity, it may require the application of an allocation methodology for many trade- and production-distorting domestic support measures that may provide support to more than one commodity. The issue under Article 13(b)(ii) is whether a particular commodity receives "backing" or "support" from a domestic support measure. But the sole fact that multiple commodities are supported by a single type of (tradeand production-distorting) measure does not mean that the "support" or backing suddenly disappears when tabulating the amounts of support for the purpose of Article 13(b)(ii).
7. Applying a methodology such as that proposed by Brazil is consistent with the object and purpose of Article 13(b)(ii) ­ to capture all identifiable non-green box trade distorting subsides that "support" upland cotton production. To allow huge amounts of trade- and production-distorting support ­ such as the almost $1 billion in counter-cyclical payments received by almost every upland cotton farmer in MY 2002 ­ to remain uncounted renders any disciplines during the implementation period inutile. Were this the intention of negotiators, as the United States argues, then it would certainly have been stated explicitly ­ with language such as "exempt from actions ... provided that measures which are paid upon the production of a specific commodity do not grant support to a specific commodity in excess of that decided during the 1992 marketing year". Or with language

such as "exempt from actions ... provided that measures are directed only at a specific commodity do not grant support ... ." It would have been simple to include these explicit phrases limiting support measures to only subsidies tied to production. But no such limitations were made in the sui generis provisions of Article 13(b)(ii).
8. In rejecting the narrow US "required production" test for "support to" in Article 13(b)(ii), the Panel must also reject the US criticisms of Brazil's methodology for calculating support to upland cotton. This is because the US challenge to Brazil's methodology is premised on incorporating into Article 13(b)(ii) the test that the only trade and production distorting support that can be counted is support that is de jure "tied to the production or sale of a given product". Yet, this "tied to the production" language is found only in Annex IV, paragraph 3 of the SCM Agreement ­ not Article 13(b)(ii) of the Agreement on Agriculture.
2.2 The US 11 February 2004 Comments Improperly Interpret the Phrase "Product-Specific"
9. Brazil has argued, in the alternative, that the contract payments would also be considered to be "product-specific" support if the term "product-specific" had actually been used in the text of Article 13(b)(ii).10 Brazil argued that the meaning of "product-specific" AMS must be governed by the only term providing some guidance to what it means ­ the definition of "non-product-specific support" in Article 1(a) of the Agreement on Agriculture.11 Because the United States raised this issue in its 11 February 2004 Comments,12 Brazil addresses it below, referencing Brazil's earlier arguments.
10. As a preliminary matter, however, Brazil must correct an error in the US 11 February 2004 Comments. The United States falsely asserts that Brazil has "conceded that `support to a specific commodity' refers to `product-specific support'".13 The alleged "concession" by Brazil14 becomes the foundation for the US arguments in paragraphs 11-17 of the US 11 February 2004 Comments.
11. As the Panel knows, Brazil argued extensively ­ and correctly ­ in the peace clause phase of this dispute that the phrase "support to a specific commodity" is not the same as "product-specific support".15 Brazil's earlier arguments noted that under the facts of this case, all of the non-green box support payments challenged by Brazil as "support to a specific commodity" would also be considered "product-specific support", within the meaning of Article 1(a) of the Agreement on Agriculture.16 However, this argument was only made in the alternative, to demonstrate that, even under the incorrect US theory, the amount of "product-specific" support for upland cotton in MY 1999-2002 exceeded the level of "product-specific" support for upland cotton decided in MY 1992.

What the United State neglects to note in its "concession" assertion is that Brazil then cited to its 22 August 2003 Rebuttal Submission, paras. 3-23 and 24-52, where Brazil argued exactly the same position it has set forth in these comments. Therefore, there was no "concession" or otherwise by Brazil. 15 Brazil's 22 August 2003 Rebuttal Submission, paras. 13-22. Brazil's 22 July 2003 Oral Statement, paras. 13-26.

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-739
12. The US 11 February 2004 Comments now go so far as to argue that any allocation methodology under Article 13(b)(ii) ­ which it argues means "product-specific" support ­ is prohibited by the Agreement on Agriculture.17 One interpretative guide to determine whether support is "product-specific" is found in the definition of "non-product-specific support" in Article 1(a) of the Agreement on Agriculture. Brazil demonstrated that only non-product specific support is actually defined and that it includes "support provided in favour of agricultural producers in general".18 The United States asserts that Brazil's definition of "general" is obsolete and that "general" means any support provided to more than one commodity.19 But this is a tortured reading of the term "in general". "Non-obsolete" definitions of "general" include "relating to a whole class of objects" and "not partial, local or sectional".20 As with the so-called "obsolete" definition criticized by the United States, these definitions fully support the ordinary meaning of "non-product-specific" support as support provided to a broad range of producers covering a wide variety of agricultural products, not simply more than one, as the United States argues.
13. Further context for the existence of some sort of an allocation methodology in the Agreement on Agriculture is Annex 3, paragraph 7, which provides that "[m]easures directed at agricultural processors shall be included to the extent that such measures benefit the producers of the basic agricultural products". This use of the term "benefit" is very similar to the notion of "support" as used in Article 13(b)(ii). The assessment of the extent to which measures directed at agricultural processors benefit producers of a particular product necessitates a delineation of support that actually benefit upstream agricultural producers. This requires an allocation methodology.
14. Further, the narrow US interpretation is contradicted by Annex 3, paragraphs 7, 8, 12 and 13 of the Agreement on Agriculture, which include as "product-specific" many types of domestic support not tied to the production of a particular commodity.21 Nor do the Agreement on Agriculture citations in paragraph 12 of the US 11 February 2004 Comments provide guidance as to where to draw the line for "non-product specific support".
15. While future negotiators may decide to clarify exactly what "product-specific" means in future revisions of the Agreement on Agriculture, the present text does not provide the "hard and fast" "production-requirement" subsidy rules advanced by the United States in this dispute. Indeed, Brazil notes that all commenting third parties in this dispute have stated their belief that the US countercyclical payments and crop insurance subsidies were "product-specific".22 This suggests that the United States' trading partners do not agree that there is a "production-requirement" test for "productspecific support". Consistent with these third party views, there is nothing in the text of the Agreement on Agriculture to support a finding that "product-specific" is determined solely by the de jure form of the payment or by whether the payment is tied to the production of the crop. Nor does the Agreement on Agriculture support the US hard and fast "tied to production" test. Absent such guidance, the determination of whether agricultural support is specific or "general" is a factual issue that must be decided on a case-by-case basis.

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-740
16. The US 11 February 2004 Comments further state that "product-specific" and "non-productspecific" are disjunctive, and that Article 6.4 of the Agreement on Agriculture requires de minimis levels of support to be categorized into "product-specific" and "non-product-specific".23 This is true, but begs the question of how and when to draw the line between product-specific and non-productspecific support. For example, the United States has argued that MY 2002 counter-cyclical payments for upland cotton are non-product specific.24 But in MY 2002, upland cotton counter-cyclical payments of almost $1 billion were received by producers holding only 1.7 per cent of US farmland.25 Brazil agrees with the EC, New Zealand, and Argentina that such payments are "partial, local or sectional" to particular US producers. 26 They are not provided "in general" to a broad group of US producers. Thus, they should be allocated as "product-specific support," including for purposes of an Article 6.4 de minimis analysis.
17. The United States argues that a single type of domestic support measure cannot be both "product-specific" and "non-product-specific" support.27 Once again, the answer to this question would depend on the facts of the case. For example, if 95 per cent of the expenditures of a so-called decoupled payment ended up in the pockets of farmers producing a single commodity (such as upland cotton counter-cyclical payments), these facts would support the finding of product-specific support for that commodity. Whether the other nine commodities eligible to receive a similar type of payment were also receiving product-specific support would have to be decided on a case-by-case basis. Similarly, if a decoupled payment programme gave farmers the flexibility to grow four different crops, but these crops represented only 10 per cent of total commodity production in that Member, then the support for each of these crops might be considered to be "product-specific".
18. In sum, the use of the term "in general" in Article 1(b) of the Agreement on Agriculture implies that this is a question of fact, the answer to which depends on a host of factors, not a simplistic and non-textually based "tied to production" rule, as advanced by the United States. Any other interpretation would write text into the Agreement on Agriculture that is not there and was not agreed to by Members. As the comments of the EC, New Zealand and Argentina in this dispute vividly illustrate, there is not an universal understanding that product-specific support means only domestic support that is de jure tied to production. By defining "non-product-specific support" using the "in general" language, Members provided flexibility to examine, on an case-by-case basis, whether the domestic support was so linked to a handful of products that it could not be considered "non-product specific support".
19. Finally, Brazil does not believe that the Panel, in this dispute settlement proceeding, is required to interpret "product-specific" support to resolve the now-expired peace clause provisions of Article 13(b)(ii). The concept of "product-specific" continues to be a significant issue with respect to ongoing negotiations and in future interpretations of Members' obligations to comply with their "total AMS" requirements. Brazil's claims in this dispute do not challenge the "total AMS" of the United States. Brazil has never claimed that "AMS" must be interpreted in this dispute. The interpretative issues relating to the peace clause can and should be resolved by interpreting the terms actually used in that provision ­ "support to a specific commodity" ­ not by interpreting the term "product-specific" that the United States now seeks to substitute in place of a carefully negotiated text.

3. Brazil's Methodology is Supported by Undisputed Evidence that the Contract Payments were Essential to Maintain Upland Cotton Production Between MY 1999-2002, and, thus, are Support to Upland Cotton
20. The US critique of Brazil's methodology rests not only on an incorrect legal interpretation of "support to a specific commodity," but more fundamentally on its false assumption that contract payments do not support the production of upland cotton. This factual assumption permeates all of the 32 pages of the US 11 February 2004 Comments. It is articulated by asserting that the contract payments are "decoupled" or "not tied to" the production of upland cotton. Ultimately, the combination of these flawed legal interpretations and factual assumptions result in the equally flawed US assertion that its Annex IV methodology is the only way to allocate contract payments (albeit only for purposes of Part III of the SCM Agreement).
21. In evaluating which methodology to use to count contract payment as "support to cotton", the starting point is the necessary fact that all the contract payments at issue are non-green box support.28 For example, direct payments and counter-cyclical payments are not properly considered "decoupled income support", within the chapeau of paragraph 6 of Annex 2 of the Agreement on Agriculture.29 This means that each of the contract payments is linked (or coupled), to some extent, to the production of one or more agricultural commodities. In addition, prior to applying the methodology, it must have been determined that the non-green box measures are "support to a specific commodity".
22. Having demonstrated these first two steps, the next question is the "amount of the support" to a specific commodity. This is a factual question and requires assessing to what extent a particular non-green box subsidy supports or maintains the production of a specific commodity or commodities. This initially requires an examination of the legal structure of the support mechanism. But more importantly, it requires an examination of the record evidence concerning the extent to which the payments de facto support or maintain the production of a specific commodity. Applied to this case, it means that the stronger the requirement for the contract payments to maintain (i.e., cover the costs of) production of upland cotton, the more appropriate it is to use a methodology that treats each dollar of payments received directly by producers of upland cotton as "support to" upland cotton.
23. The US "Annex IV" methodology assumes that all four contract payments are not tied in any significant way to the production of upland cotton. The primary evidence relied on by the United States are the legal provisions of the 1996 FAIR Act and the 2002 FSRI Act, which permit "producers" to grow other crops (except fruits, vegetables and wild rice) and still receive the contract payments. The United States argued that the legally permitted "decoupled" form of the support requires the payment to be spread out over the entire value of a farm's production.30 It is this assumption that underpins the US Annex IV methodology.
24. Calculating the amount of contract payments that is "support" to upland cotton by allocating the benefit of those payments across total production of farms receiving the payments might make sense if the four contract payments had, in fact, no significant role in maintaining the production of upland cotton. But the US methodology runs headlong into the overwhelming weight of the evidence showing a direct and significant link between "producers" receiving upland cotton contract payments and "producers" planting upland cotton. Brazil produced extensive evidence showing the link
28 The Panel would not be able to count these programmes for purposes of Article 13(b)(ii) unless they are out of the green box, and thus, "non-green box" support.

between these contract payments and the maintenance of upland cotton production.31 Consider the following key uncontested facts:
· 96 per cent of MY 2002 upland cotton acreage was planted on farms that hold upland cotton base.32 This demonstrates that the overwhelming majority of current US upland cotton production is planted on upland cotton base and shows that, in fact, direct and countercyclical payments are directly linked to current production.
· US upland cotton producers would have lost $332.79 per acre between MY 1997-2002 if they had not received upland cotton contract payments.33 This demonstrates the critical role contract payments play in sustaining production of upland cotton during MY 1999-2002.
· Without direct and counter-cyclical payments in MY 2002, the average US cotton farmer would have lost 14.36 cents per pound. With these two payments, they earned a "profit" of 4.2 cents per pound with the cotton DP and CCP payments.34
· Producers growing crops on upland cotton acreage receive much higher per acre payments than all other "covered commodities", except rice. The higher per acre payments are directly related to the higher costs to produce cotton compared to other crops.35 This fact highlights the expectation that former producers would continue to be present producers.36 This is an expectation that is a reality, since 96 per cent of upland cotton farmers do plant upland cotton on high per-acre payment upland cotton base acreage.
· Upland cotton producers in MY 2002 received $446.8 million in upland cotton direct payments, representing a subsidization rate of 13.1 per cent.37
· Upland cotton producers in MY 2002 received $986.4 million in upland cotton countercyclical payments, representing a subsidization rate of 28.9 per cent. 38
· The amount of US planted cotton acreage has shown only relatively small shifts over the past ten years regardless of market price movements, confirming the influence of the contract

32 See Annex A, Section 1, para. 16. This figure might be slightly overstated by possible aggregation problems. However, Brazil notes that the total amount of upland cotton base on farms planting upland cotton and holding upland cotton base exceeds MY 2002 plantings by 800,000 (13.8 million acres v 13 million acres), suggesting that any aggregation problem for MY 2002 is not significant.

See Table 3.8 for the total value of the upland cotton crop on all farms producing upland cotton. 38 See Annex A, Section 1, Table 1.5. See Table 3.8 for the total value of the upland cotton crop on all farms producing upland cotton.

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-743
payments in maintaining large volumes of production.39 This evidence is consistent with NCC testimony and USDA data showing that most upland cotton farmers do not shift out of specializing in upland cotton production towards the production of other crops to any great extent.40
· NCC officials repeatedly stated that their cotton farmer members cannot produce upland cotton without contract payments, and they have always treated contract payments as an integral part of an overall subsidy package of support for upland cotton production.41
25. In addition to the above, the provisions of the 2002 FSRI Act are evidence that upland cotton contract payments were intended to support the production of upland cotton. First, Section 1104(c)(1)(F) of the 2002 FSRI Act sets a "target price" for upland cotton of 72.4 cents per pound, which guarantees high revenues in much the same way that deficiency payments worked before MY 1996. This upland cotton-specific "target price" was requested by the NCC in 2001 and exists to support upland cotton ­ not the production of other crops. The cotton target price results in much higher per acre counter-cyclical payments for upland cotton than other crops (except rice). Second, Sections 1103(a) and 1104(a) require payments to current producers growing on covered crop base acreage. In other words, Congress intended that only farmers actually planting crops (or sharing the risk of planting a crop if one would have been produced) would directly receive the payments. Third, Section 1103(b) of the 2002 FSRI Act establishes very high direct payment rates for upland cotton base relative to other "covered commodities"42
26. The facts set out above are crucial for understanding why the US "Annex IV" methodology rests on a completely false assumption. That assumption is that US producers of upland cotton do not need or rely on the full amount of upland cotton payments to cover their long-term losses from the production of upland cotton. The United States implements this assumption by proposing that the only methodology that can be used is one that would spread the entire amount of the contract payments across the total value of an upland cotton farmer's production. But the record shows conclusively that most upland cotton farmers simply could not produce upland cotton profitably in MY 1999-2002 without using all contract payments they demanded and received for their upland cotton production.
27. The US 11 February 2004 Comments argue that Brazil's methodology for counting support to upland cotton makes "no economic sense".43 But it is the US Annex IV methodology, as applied to contract payments to US upland cotton producers, that makes no economic sense. For example, if upland cotton farmers were, in fact, using these payments to support unprofitable dairy, livestock, or fish farming operations, then they would have lost money on their upland cotton production. The fact that US producers were able to grow any upland cotton at all in MY 2002 after four straight years of huge "losses" (totalling $872 per acre by MY 2002,44 comparing production costs and market revenue) demonstrates conclusively the production-sustaining effects of these subsidies.45 Indeed, the

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-744

continued high levels of plantings in MY 2002 despite these losses are strong evidence that upland cotton producers did in fact (a) receive, and (b) use upland cotton contract payments to sustain their upland cotton production during MY 1999-2002. If not, US upland production would have been far lower, as farmers simply could not have survived economically. Thus, the US assumption in its "Annex IV" methodology that producers did not need or use upland cotton payments to sustain highcost upland cotton production is simply wrong.
28. By contrast, Brazil's methodology properly reflects the economic reality of the key role these payments played in sustaining US upland cotton production in MY 1999-2002. Brazil, like the NCC, believes that the contract payments were necessary for the maintenance and the survival of US upland cotton production during MY 1999-2002.46 In keeping with the key role that upland cotton contract payments played in sustaining upland cotton production, the principal element of Brazil's methodology focuses only on upland cotton contract payments made to producers of upland cotton. Such "cotton to cotton" payments represent the vast bulk of contract payments received by upland cotton producers. For example, under Brazil's methodology, 99.1 per cent of the MY 2002 direct payments received by upland cotton producers were upland cotton payments.47 Similarly, under Brazil's methodology, 99.8 per cent of the MY 2002 counter-cyclical payments received by upland cotton producers were upland cotton payments.48 Treating all of these "cotton to cotton" payments as support to upland cotton is fully supported by the essential role these cotton payments play in sustaining US upland cotton production.
29. The second (and relatively minor) part of Brazil's methodology is to account for the nonupland cotton contract payments received by current upland cotton producers. These non-upland cotton base payments represented a tiny 0.9 per cent in MY 2002 of the total direct payments allocated to upland cotton under Brazil's methodology, and 0.2 per cent in MY 2002 of the countercyclical payments allocated to upland cotton under Brazil's methodology. This small part of Brazil's methodology first pools any contract payments received for base acres not planted to their respective base crop and then distributes them as support to these contract payment crops according to their share of total "overplanted" base acreage on the farm.
30. The facts show that it is appropriate for Brazil to allocate these payments over the plantings of the other "covered commodities" produced by an upland cotton producer. Brazil demonstrated that, for each of the marketing years from 2000-2002, an upland cotton producer growing upland cotton on non-contract acreage would have suffered considerable losses.49 Even growing on non-upland cotton (except rice) base acreage would have resulted in losses during most of the period of investigation.50 Therefore, the relatively few upland cotton producers planting on some other type of base acreage needed and relied on the non-upland cotton payments to come close to making a profit. Without such payments, the average producer would have not been able to sustain upland cotton production.
31. In addition, the allocation across all contract crops (as opposed to all farm products produced) is justified by the evidence of the "specific" nature of the "covered commodity" payments. The United States never contested Brazil's evidence or argument that the contract payments are "specific" subsidies within the meaning of the SCM Agreement. For example, the United States never rebutted evidence that the 2002 FSRI Act "covered commodities" represented only 24 per cent of the value of US farm receipts (and 30 per cent of US farm acreage) in MY 2002, and that the 1996 FAIR Act "programme crops" represented less than 14 per cent of the value of US crops (and 22 per cent of the

acreage) during MY 1999-2001.51 Nor did the United States ever rebut any of the numerous statements of the users and recipients of the contract payments ­ the NCC ­ that they needed and received contract payments to survive.52
32. In sum, the proper allocation methodology under Article 13(b)(ii) of the Agreement on Agriculture must be consistent with the extent to which the domestic support payments directly maintain the production of a specific commodity. Brazil's methodology reflects the crucial role that each of the four contract payments plays in maintaining the production of US upland cotton. By contrast, the US "Annex IV" methodology assumes incorrectly that these payments do not support upland cotton any more than they support catfish farming or other production activities on an upland cotton farm. For the above reasons, Brazil requests that the Panel reject the US arguments, and adopt Brazil's methodology for allocating the contract payments.
4. A Methodology to Count Contract Payments Is Appropriate Based on the Text of Article 13(b)(ii) of the Agreement on Agriculture
33. The United States criticizes Brazil's methodology (and presumably any other methodology) because it is not based in the "text" of the peace clause or the Agreement on Agriculture.53 Instead, the United States argues that the Panel should use Annex IV of the SCM Agreement as the basis for its calculation of the amount of the contract payments.54
34. Article 13(b)(ii) of the Agreement on Agriculture does not provide explicit guidance on how to count up the amount of support for contract or any other type of payments.55 But that does not mean that no counting methodology can be used. The absence of explicit guidance on implementing more general provisions has not stopped WTO panels or parties from proposing and using methodologies to tabulate the amount of subsidies, costs, and volumes of trade impacted.
35. The Panel only need to look as far as the export credit guarantee arguments in this dispute as an example. Item (j) establishes that export credit guarantee programmes constitute export subsidies if they are operated at premium rates that are inadequate to cover the long-term operating costs and losses of the programmes.56 There is no explicit methodology provided in the text of item (j) that would define how to apply this provision. Yet, the United States has repeatedly argued for the application of a cash-basis accounting methodology to tabulate the amount of costs and losses.
36. Similarly, DSU Article 22.7 requires any suspension of concessions to be "equivalent to the level of nullification or impairment". As with Article 13(b)(ii) of the Agreement on Agriculture, this requires the tabulation of amounts ­ in the case of Article 22.7, the amounts of trade impacted through the non-implementation of WTO-inconsistent measures. Again, there is no methodology provided in Article 22.7 to assess the level of nullification or impairment. Nevertheless, arbitrators, at the urging, inter alia, of the United States, have applied DSU Article 22.7 using a variety of methodologies developed on a case-by-case basis to assess the level of nullification or impairment.57

53 US 11 February 2004 Comments, para. 8. 54 The United States argues that its methodology can only be used in connection with Part III of the SCM Agreement, not the Agreement on Agriculture. (See e.g. US 11 February 2004 Comments, paras. 2, 86). 55 Nor does Annex IV, as discussed in Section 4 below. 56 Brazil also claims that the export credit guarantee programmes constitute export subsidies under the terms of Articles 1.1. and 3.1(a) of the SCM Agreement. 57 Arbitrator Report, EC ­ Bananas (US), WT/DS27/ARB; Arbitrator Report, EC ­ Bananas (Ecuador), WT/DS27/ARB; Arbitrator Report, EC ­ Hormones (US, Canada), WT/DS26/ARB and

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-746
37. Finally, other provisions of the WTO Agreement similarly require WTO Members, as a practical matter, to implement general obligations by applying different valuation and allocation methodologies under general Anti-Dumping Agreement and the SCM Agreement rules.58
38. The United States argues that only Annex IV of the SCM Agreement offers any useful context. While it derides Brazil's methodology as being "invented", a close look at the text of Article IV reveals that it is ill-equipped to address the tabulation of support issue before the Panel. Annex IV, which is entitled "Calculation of the Total Ad Valorem Subsidization (Paragraph 1(a) of Article 6)" deals ­ as the title indicates ­ with the calculation of subsidization rates, within the meaning of Article 6.1(a) of the SCM Agreement. However, the "support to cotton" question before this Panel is not establishing an ad valorem subsidization rate, but rather the calculation of the amount of support to upland cotton, within the meaning of Article 13(b)(ii) of the SCM Agreement.
39. But setting aside the problem that Annex IV deals with calculation of a subsidization rate, the US contract payments at issue in this dispute are de facto tied to upland cotton production. Thus, Annex IV paragraph 3 would be implicated, i.e., the subsidization rate is determined by dividing the total amount of the tied contract payment subsidies by the total value of upland cotton sales. But this presupposes that the amount of the payments subsidies is known. Thus, Annex IV does not answer the crucial question how to determine the amount of the de facto tied contract payments that constitute support to upland cotton. Instead, it only offers a methodology to calculate the subsidization rate for known amounts of subsidies.
40. Indeed, Annex IV itself recognizes that there are holes in its provisions, stipulating in footnote 62 to Annex IV that "[a]n understanding among Members should be developed, as necessary, on matters which are not specified in this Annex or which need further clarification for purposes of paragraph 1(a) of Article 6". One such matter could have been the scope of the meaning of "tied to the production or sale of a given product". Must the "tie to production" be de jure as the United States argues, or de facto as Brazil asserts? But no understanding or clarification of this, or any other issue relating to Annex IV, was agreed to by Members prior to the expiration of Annex IV in 2000.
41. Thus, Annex IV does not assist the Panel in determining the amount of support to upland cotton, within the meaning of Article 13(b)(ii) of the Agreement on Agriculture. Contrary to the US arguments, paragraph 2 of Annex IV is inapplicable because the subsidies at issue are de facto tied to upland cotton production. Further, paragraph 3 of Annex IV does not provide any guidance on how to calculate the amount of the subsidy which is the goal of the Article 13(b)(ii) exercise.
42. In conclusion, it is incorrect to assert that the absence of any specific methodology precludes the Panel from applying one for the purposes of Article 13(b)(ii). It is also incorrect to claim that Annex IV provides definitive guidance, because it could only be useful for establishing a rate of subsidization, and not for calculating the amount of the subsidy. Thus, as with its item (j) analysis, the Panel needs to adopt a reasonable methodology to be applied for purposes of the peace clause in assessing the amount of support to upland cotton from the four contract payment programmes. This methodology must reflect the facts in the record and be consistent with the text, context and object
WT/DS48/ARB; Arbitrator Report, Brazil ­ Aircraft, WT/DS46/ARB; Arbitrator Report, US ­ FSC, WT/DS108/ARB; Arbitrator Report, Canada ­ Aircraft II, WT/DS222/ARB.
58 See e.g. Appellate Body Report, US ­ Lumber CVDs Final, WT/DS257/AB/R, paras. 155-166 (Appellate Body affirmed panel's finding that a "pass-through" methodology analysis must be performed by investigating authorities to determine the amount of subsidies benefiting down-stream purchases of subsidized products; this was despite the fact that no specific methodology for pass through was explicitly set out in Articles 10 and 32.1 of the SCM Agreement); Panel Report, US ­ Sheet/Plate from Korea, WT /DS179/R, paras. 6.135-36 (finding USDOC methodology applying multiple averaging periods during the investigation appropriate to implement "fair comparison" standard of Article 2.4 of the Anti-Dumping Agreement).

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-747
and purpose of Article 13(b)(ii). As Brazil has argued, its methodology ­ or some variant of its methodology such as the cotton-to-cotton methodology ­ is reasonable given the key role that contract payments played in the maintenance of upland cotton production during MY 1999-2002.59
5. The Evidence in the Record Supports a Finding, under any Methodology, that the United States' Level of Support Provided in MY 1999-2002 Exceeded the amount of Support Decided in MY 1992
43. Brazil responds in this section to the US 11 February 2004 Comments asserting that Brazil has not established that the amount of "support to upland cotton" in MY 1999-2002 is greater than the support decided in MY 1992.60 Brazil's basic response to these arguments is that even if the United States does not produce the farm-specific information by 3 March 2004, the Panel has before it sufficient evidence, including the evidence of any adverse inferences, to establish the amount of four contract payments for MY 1999-2002. The less-than-ideal data analyzed below confirms, in the first instance, Brazil's 14/16th methodology. Moreover, even if the Panel were to rely directly on the figures generated below from the application of Brazil's methodology, the US Annex IV methodology and a variation of each of those methodologies to the incomplete US data,61 these figures support a finding that the US support to upland cotton in MY 1999-2002 exceeded the level decided in MY 1992.
44. Brazil's analysis of the data below is necessary because Brazil's 28 January 2004 original analysis of the incomplete US data submitted on 18/19 December 2003 did not include additional data the United States recognized62 it failed to produce on 18/19 December 2003, and subsequently produced on 28 January 2004. Brazil has made certain adjustments to respond to criticisms of the United States. Further, to assist the Panel, Brazil presents the calculations from a minor variation of Brazil's methodology and of the US Annex IV methodology. In the final analysis, these various methodologies are "tools" (not "claims") that assist the Panel in making an objective assessment of the US data and other evidence before it for purposes of making a peace clause finding (and, if the Panel deems this necessary, the amount of subsidization for Brazil's serious prejudice claims).
45. Below, Brazil presents its updated results of the two methodologies applied in Sections 9 and 10 of its 28 January 2004 Comments and Requests Regarding US Data. This update is based on the revised US data provided by the United States on 28 January 2004.63 For detailed calculations, Brazil refers the Panel to Annex A to this submission.
59 See Section 3, supra. The fact that the great majority of upland cotton is planted on upland cotton base (86.34 per cent in MY 1999, 82.05 per cent in MY 2000, 80.10 percent in MY 2001 and 96.17 per cent in MY 2002) lends considerable support for this conclusion. These amounts are calculated as the share of upland cotton production planted on farms holding upland cotton base (up to the amount of upland cotton base) of total upland cotton plantings. MY 1999-2001 data are taken from category "1" farms and total upland cotton planting from the rPFCsum.xls file provided by the United States on 28 January 2004. Data for MY 2002 is taken from "Enrolled in Cotton PFC and planted cotton" farms and total upland cotton plantings from the rDCPsum.xls file provided by the United States on 28 January 2004.
60 See US 11 February 2004 Comments, paras. 15-17. This section also responds to the US comments that Brazil has not established a prima facie case of the amount of the contract payment subsidies for the purpose of its serious prejudice claims.
61 Brazil recalls that even the revised US summary data produced on 28 January 2004 suffers from aggregation problems and falls short of enabling the Panel and Brazil to account for soybean market loss assistance and peanut direct and counter-cyclical payments in its allocations. See Section 3 of Brazil's 28 January 2004 Comments and Requests Regarding US Data.

Cotton-to-Cotton Methodology

46. Brazil first presents the results of using a slight variation of Brazil's methodology. Brazil
notes the US arguments that only upland cotton contract payments could be included in any "support
to" upland cotton. Counting only upland cotton payments would undercount the amount of contract support, as Brazil argues in Section 9, infra. 64 But even though it undercounts the amount of support,
a methodology that examines only "cotton-to-cotton" payments is supported by the evidence in the
record described in Section 3 supra, including the fact that in MY 2002 96 per cent of upland cotton was planted on upland cotton base acreage.65

47. Brazil sets out the results of examining only the upland cotton contract payments received by producers planting upland cotton for MY 1999-2002 in Table 1.5 below:66

CCP Payments $986,357,993.8

48. As Brazil described in its 28 January 2004 Comments, the results of this analysis may be
distorted somewhat because the revised US summary data does not control for aggregation problems.68 However, given the fact that the United States can be deemed to know the amount of
payments from a cotton-to-cotton match, any continued refusal of the United States to produce the
data should permit the Panel to infer that the data outlined above is accurate.

Brazil's Methodology

49. Brazil also presents the results of applying its proposed methodology. However, given the
absence of farm-specific information, Brazil can present only a modified version of its proposed methodology, as discussed in more detail in its 20 January 2004 Answers to Additional Questions69 and applied in its 28 January 2004 Comments and Requests Regarding US Data.70 The data presented
below updates Brazil's earlier calculations by using the 28 January 2004 revised US summary data

64 US 11 February 2004 Comments, paras. 47-51. See also US 28 January 2004 Comments, paras. 34-
52, 208. 65 Calculated as the share of upland cotton production planted on farms holding upland cotton base (up
to the amount of upland cotton base) of total upland cotton plantings. MY 1999-2001 data are taken from
category "1" farms and total upland cotton planting from the rPFCsum.xls file provided by the United States on
28 January 2004. Data for MY 2002 is taken from "Enrolled in Cotton PFC and planted cotton" farms and total
upland cotton plantings from the rDCPsum.xls file provided by the United States on 28 January 2004. 66 This is because only in MY 2002 was less acreage planted to upland cotton than the total amount of
upland cotton base acreage held by farms producing upland cotton and holding upland cotton base. In MY
1999-2001, the amount of upland cotton acreage slightly exceeded the amount of upland cotton base. This
phenomenon is the effect of the base update allowed for under the 2002 FSRI Act. 67 For details of the calculations, see Annex A.1. 68 Brazil notes that the US summary data requested by the Panel on 3 February 2004 (part (b) of the
Panel's Request for Information under DSU Article 13) would not result in aggregation problems tainting the
results, nor would farm-specific data withheld by the United States and requested by Brazil on 3 December 2003
and by the Panel on 8 December 2003, 12 January 2004 and 3 February 2004 (part (a) of the Panel's Request for
Information under DSU Article 13). 69 See Brazil's 20 January 2004 Answers to Additional Questions, paras. 43-55. 70 See Section 9 of Brazil's 28 January 2004 Comments and Requests Regarding US Data.

that includes information on contract payments to farms not holding upland cotton base but producing upland cotton.71 The following table shows the results of applying Brazil's allocation methodology to the revised US summary data.72

Modified US Annex IV methodology

50. Brazil also applied the revised US summary data to a modified "Annex IV" methodology allocating total contract payments to farms producing upland cotton over the value of contract payment crops produced on these farms. This methodology is based on two assumptions: first, contract payments are support only to contract payment crops; and second, contract payments are allocated pursuant to the value of these contract crops' production on upland cotton producing farms.

51. Brazil believes that this methodology is not appropriate because it improperly undercounts the amount of support provided to maintain the production of upland cotton. Nevertheless, the analysis of this methodology permits the Panel to assess the impact of different assumptions on the amount of contract payments allocated. Further, because the "cotton-to-cotton" and "Brazil's" methodologies are supported by the strong link between contract payments and maintaining upland cotton production, the same evidence would more than support the modified Annex IV methodology. The following table shows the results of this allocation methodology. Brazil notes these figures are understated due to the fact that the United States did not provide any data concerning soybean market loss assistance payments and peanut direct and counter-cyclical payments.73

52. Finally, Brazil has applied the revised US summary data to the US-proposed methodology ­ updating the calculations presented in Section 10 of Brazil's 28 January 2004 Comments and Requests Regarding US Data. The data presented here updates Brazil's earlier calculations by using the 28 January 2004 revised US summary data that includes information on contract payments to

53. For purposes of comparison, Brazil reproduces the results of its "14/16th" methodology, as presented to the Panel at paragraphs 8 of Brazil's 22 December 2003 Answers to Questions and Brazil's 9 September 2003 Further Submission.

CCP Payments $935,600,000

54. Brazil notes that the results from each of the four methodologies applied to the revised US summary data suffer from shortcomings due to the incomplete and non-farm-specific data. Brazil would have to re-calculate all of these numbers if the United States produces the actual data on 3 March 2004. As it stands, the data currently available undercounts the support under each of the methodologies (except the cotton-to-cotton), because no information on soybean market loss assistance payments and peanut direct and counter-cyclical payments to farms producing upland cotton was provided by the United States. Further, due to the manner in which the US data is provided, distortions from the aggregation of farm-specific data possibly over- or under-state the results, as discussed in Section 6 below. Therefore, Brazil remains of the view that in the absence of complete farm-specific aggregated data, the Panel should rely on Brazil's 14/16th methodology.

55. While Brazil does not believe that the Panel should rely on either the two Annex IV-type methodologies, or even the "cotton-to-cotton" methodology, it is noteworthy that all four of the methodologies show that the United States does not enjoy peace clause protection.76 The table below
shows the results of the comparison of US support to upland cotton decided in MY 1992 with US
support to upland cotton provided in MY 2002. Under any methodology, the US support to upland
cotton in MY 2002 exceeds the support decided in MY 1992 considerably ­ by at least $464 million.

74 Calculations based on this data continue to suffer from aggregation problems and the missing
information on soybean contract payments and peanut direct and counter-cyclical payments to farms producing
upland cotton. (See Section 3 of Brazil's 28 January 2004 Comments and Requests Regarding US Data). 75 For details of the calculations, see Annex A.4. 76 Only under methodology (4) in MY 2000 is the support provided in that marketing year below the
support decided in MY 1992.

56. Brazil presents the tabulations for MY 1999-2001 in Annex B. These data show that the
United States also exceeds the MY 1992 limits under each of the four methodologies (except for methodology (4) in MY 2000) and under Brazil's 14/16th methodology.79

6. The US Critique of Brazil's Allocation Methodology Is Baseless

57. Brazil recalls that its methodology allocates support paid for upland cotton base that is
"planted to" upland cotton. It further allocates proportionally any other contract crop base payments that are not allocated to plantings of the respective contract payments crop.80 Brazil's methodology, as well as the "cotton-to-cotton" methodology, generates results that are very close to Brazil's 14/16th methodology. This is not surprising since the 14/16th methodology is based on the assumption of very
high percentages of upland cotton "planted on" upland cotton base acreage. All three of these
methodologies reflect the economic reality in MY 1999-2002 that each allocated contract dollar
received by upland cotton producers over a four-year period was needed to cover the costs of
producing upland cotton. The fact that the vast majority of upland cotton was actually planted on
upland cotton base is further confirmation of the reasonableness of these three methodologies.

58. Much of the US criticism of Brazil's methodology is tainted by the wrong assumption that contract payments provide "decoupled income support".81 For example, the United States states, at
paragraph 38 of its 11 February 2004 Comments, that "fundamentally, Brazil's approach is in error

77 The table below reproduces the table at paragraph 73 of Brazil's 22 August 2003 Rebuttal
Submission as updated by paragraph 8 of Brazil's 22 December 2003 Answers to Questions and paragraphs 12-
14 of the US 22 December 2004 Answers to Questions. Step 2 and marketing loan payments have been updated
in light of the US answer to Question 196. See US 22 December 2004 Answers to Questions, para. 12. 78 "Other Payments" have been included in the marketing loan figures. 79 Besides conclusively demonstrating that the US non-green box domestic support measures are not
exempt from action by virtue of Article 13(b)(ii) of the Agreement on Agriculture, the table above, as well as
the tables in Annex B, indicate the amount of subsidization of upland cotton by contract payments. Thus,
should the Panel consider that an allocation methodology is warranted under Part III of the SCM Agreement, the
record provides the factual basis for a finding that Brazil has met its burden of proof and established a prima
facie case of the amount of subsidization. 80 Brazil's 20 January 2004 Answers to Additional Questions, para. 43-55 and Brazil's 28 January 2004
Comments and Requests Regarding US Data, Section 9. 81 See inter alia US 11 February 2004 Comments, paras. 37. See also US 28 January 2004 Comments,
paras. 217, 219, 222-223.

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-752
because it assumes that there is a tie between the decoupled payments and current production". The United States is correct ­ Brazil's methodologies do make that assumption, for the very good reason that that assumption reflects the economic cost realities and the cotton-to-cotton planting on the ground, discussed in Section 3 supra. Similarly, the United States claims, at paragraph 37 of its comments, that "decoupled payments by their nature provide income support not tied to the production or sale of any given commodity". But this ignores the vast weight of the evidence, which demonstrates the link between upland cotton production and upland cotton base acre payments (and other payments) in MY 1999-2002.
59. The United States raises a number of hypothetical "problems" with Brazil's methodology.82 But the extent of any such problems, if any, can only be assessed by examining the actual farmspecific data. It is not credible for the United States to refuse to produce key farm-specific data and then speculate about potential problems for individual farms. Upon receipt of the US response to the Panel's request, Brazil looks forward to providing the Panel with such an analysis.
60. A principle complaint of the United States is that Brazil's allocation of non-upland cotton contract payments results in differential subsidization rates on different acres planted to upland cotton.83 Similarly, the United States criticizes Brazil for potentially allocating more than one nonupland cotton base acre payments to one planted acre of upland cotton.84 Both of these alleged problems with the allocation of non-upland cotton contract payments do not exist for MY 2002. This is because Brazil's methodology allocates for each planted acres of upland cotton only one upland cotton base acre payment.85 In MY 2002, the vast majority of contract payments allocated as support to upland cotton are upland cotton contract payments. In MY 2002, 99.1 per cent of direct payments86 and 99.8 per cent of the counter-cyclical payments87 received by upland cotton producers were upland cotton contract payments. This is because the vast majority of upland cotton is grown on farms holding upland cotton base, which in MY 2002 exceeds acreage planted to upland cotton. Farms growing upland cotton but not holding upland cotton base accounted for only 0.9 and 0.2 per cent of total allocated direct and counter-cyclical payments respectively. Since the two main US criticisms affect only the allocation of non-upland cotton contract payments, they affect, at most, 0.9 per cent of the payments at issue for MY 2002.88
61. Brazil notes that the "cotton-to-cotton" methodology, discussed in Section 5, does not allocate any non-upland cotton base payments. Therefore, none of the US criticisms, at paragraphs 37-42 of its 11 February 2004 Comments, affects the "cotton-to-cotton" results for MY 1999-2002. Thus, these results reflect the worst case scenario of any alleged over-counting in Brazil's methodology. Comparing the results of both methodologies, reproduced in Section 5 and Annex B demonstrates that even under the "cotton-to-cotton" methodology the Unites States surpasses its peace clause limits. The tables below reproduce the results of both methodologies:
82 US 11 February 2004 Comments, paras. 37-42. 83 US 11 February 2004 Comments, para. 37. 84 US 11 February 2004 Comments, para. 38-42. 85 The United States has not criticized Brazil's allocation of one payments on one contract payment base acres to one planted acre of cotton and the other contract payment crops. In other word, the United States accepts that the one-to-one allocation between planted and base acres. 86 See Annex A.2, Tables 2.9, 2.21 and 2.21. 87 See Annex A.2, Tables 2.9, 2.20 and 2.21. 88 The United States has not criticized Brazil's allocation of one payments on one contract payment base acres to one planted acre of cotton and the other contract payment crops. In other word, the United States accepts that the one-to-one allocation between planted and base acres.

62. As the Panel can readily see, the differences in the results of both methodologies are minor (with $118 million in MY 1999, $114 million in MY 2000, $95.5 million in MY 2001, and $5.7 million in MY 2002).

63. In addressing the specific US criticism affecting MY 1999-2001, Brazil notes that its methodology involves analysing the planting patterns and base acres of individual farms. Each farm is unique. Some farms will have greater base acres than planted acres and vice versa. Some farms will plant different crops than they used to establish their base acres, and, as in the case of most upland cotton farms, they will continue to plant upland cotton holding upland cotton base acres. Brazil's methodology accounts for all contract payments as support to contract crops planted on farms holding base. This means that some farms will have "extra" base acres payments that will need to be allocated over fewer planted acres of contract payments crops or vice versa. This reflects economic realities for farms that have many different combinations of base and planted acres.

64. The US comments, at paragraph 37 of its 11 February 2004 Comments, raise theoretical "arbitrary" attribution problems relating to "excess cotton acreage" or "excess" base acreage situations for a hypothetical farm. But the purpose of any methodology is not to determine the "subsidization" rate of a particular farm, but rather to assess, in the aggregate, the amount of payments. Of course, different farms will have different crop subsidization rates given the inherently unique base acreage and planting combinations. Therefore, Brazil's methodology, which is based on examining individual farm data, may result, in certain cases, in different crop subsidization rates for different farms. But this is neither remarkable nor illogical, as the United States claims, but rather reflects economic reality.

89 Market Loss Assistance Payments are calculated as PFC payments multiplied by the ratio of upland cotton market loss assistance payments to upland cotton PFC payments, as contained in Exhibit Bra-4 ("Fact Sheet: Upland Cotton", USDA, January 2003, p. 6). Since payment rates are not available directly, this ratio provides the information because both subsidies are paid based off the same payment units. Brazil notes that the market loss assistance payment amounts are understated by the non-allocated amount of soybean market loss assistance payments for which the United States has not produced any information.

Brazil notes that the market loss assistance payment amounts are understated by the non-allocated amount of soybean market loss assistance payments for which the United States has not produced any information.

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-754
65. The United States further complains that Brazil allocates all "excess" contract payments in MY 1999-2000 and almost all "excess" contract payments in MY 2001 to upland cotton.91 However, the data shows that in those three marketing years, all contract payment crops (except upland cotton) were planted to a degree that fell short of the base acreage for these crops. Thus, the simple fact that upland cotton farms during MY 1999-2001 increased their amount of upland cotton plantings at the expense of other contract payment crops suggests that some of the payments for these non-upland cotton base acres were devoted to supporting upland cotton production. This is reflected in Brazil's 28 January 2004 calculations (as well as in its updated calculations in Annex A.2). Brazil's calculations, therefore, reflect the reality of upland cotton production in those marketing years ­ production on upland cotton farms shifted to upland cotton and away from other contract payment crops. Brazil notes that no such "excess" upland cotton production exists in MY 2002. This appears to be ­ at the very least in part ­ a direct consequence of the base update aligning contract payments base with production trends during MY 1998-2001.92 The re-linkage of production meant that more current upland cotton production takes place on base acreage than during MY 1999-2001.
66. Finally, the United States asserts that the aggregation problems inherent in the US summary data will necessarily increase the amount of payments allocated to upland cotton.93 This criticism is again an ironic assertion by a party that has refused to provide the very data that would answer this criticism. Whether the aggregation problem leads to an upward or downward error in estimating the amount of support to upland cotton is a factual question that cannot be answered in the abstract, as suggested by the United States.94 Indeed, the effect of the aggregation problem is that upland cotton contract payments on farms that have "excess" upland cotton base are treated as upland cotton payments to farms that have "excess" upland cotton plantings.95 Whether such a treatment leads to over- or under-counting depends entirely on what the amount of support allocated to the "excess" planted upland cotton acres would be, which can only be derived with using farm-specific data. Only if it is lower then the support for an upland cotton base acre (allocated due to the aggregation effect) would the aggregation problem lead to over-counting. And this is a factual, not a theoretical question. The amount of support allocated to the "excess" acres planted to upland cotton could rank from zero (no contract payments available for allocation on that farm) to an amount that exceeds the upland cotton per-acre payment rate (for instance, rice base or payments for more than one base acre). Again, it bears repeating, that there will be no "aggregation problems" if the United States produces complete farm-specific data on 3 March 2004.
67. In sum, Brazil maintains that, in view of the de facto tied nature of the US contract payments at issue, Brazil's methodology is a reasonable means of calculating the support to upland cotton. As for some of the US criticisms that might affect the results (except for MY 2002), Brazil will control for these effects once the United States provides aggregate data in the manner requested by the Panel. Yet, Brazil is of the firm view that none of the US criticisms will meaningfully affect its results.
7. The US Critique of Brazil's Application of the Improper Annex IV Methodology is Baseless
68. Brazil has earlier demonstrated, in Section 4 above, the inability of Annex IV of the SCM Agreement to provide useful guidance regarding the calculation of the amount of the contract payments that constitute support to upland cotton. Brazil further demonstrated that the entire premise behind the US attempt to use an Annex IV-like methodology is wrong, since contract payments during MY 1999-2002 were de facto tied to the production of upland cotton.
91 US 11 January 2004 Comments, paras. 40. 92 Brazil notes that part of the phenomenon also results from reduced upland cotton plantings. 93 US 11 January 2004 Comments, para. 42. 94 US 11 January 2004 Comments, para. 42. 95 See Brazil's 28 January 2004 Comments and Requests Regarding US Data, para. 13-15.

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-755
69. Nevertheless, as an alternative argument, Brazil attempted in its 28 January 2004 Comments to apply the Annex IV paragraph 2 non-tied subsidy allocation methodology to the US summary data. As a preliminary matter, Brazil notes that the United States has never presented any data in support of its methodology.96 Instead, the United States has repeatedly argued that it is not its "burden" to establish the amount of contract payments under its own methodology. The United States has gone even further and refused, to date, to provide the data that would permit the calculation of its "across the value of total production on the farm" methodology. As a result, Brazil had to make a number of assumptions to fill the data gaps. The United States has reserved its energy regarding its methodology for a spirited critique of Brazil's attempt to apply the US methodology. Brazil responds to these to these arguments, and the incorrect US calculations, below.
70. First, the United States challenges, in paragraph 51 of its 11 February 2004 Comments, the use of non-upland cotton base acreage payments. This criticism is incorrect, since the Panel must make an objective assessment of the amount of "support to" upland cotton under Article 13(b)(ii), including support provided from non-upland cotton base payments. Therefore, Brazil's inclusion of all contract payments in its calculation was proper. Brazil sets out its arguments in Section 9 infra.97 Consequently, all of the US calculations at paragraphs 59-60 of the US 11 February 2004 Comments are incorrect, because they exclude all non-upland cotton payments.98
71. Second, the United States criticizes Brazil for not having included all farm and non-farm income of a farm into its calculations.99 There is no legitimate basis to include social security and stock market investment income in any payment calculation.100 Brazil has earlier responded to similar US arguments in cost of production discussions.101 The focus of Article 13(b)(ii) is on tabulating the amount of agricultural domestic support to a specific commodity.
72. Third, the United States claims that Brazil should have included the value of livestock raised by upland cotton farmers. The United States has provided no data to support its own methodology or its implied assertion that livestock production is a major component of upland cotton farms' production. However, the record supports Brazil's decision not to include any livestock value. A USDA 1997 ARMS study on costs of production on cotton farms showed that only between 0-6 per cent (depending on the category and location) of US upland cotton farms specialize in livestock production.102 Since no significant amount of livestock production is found on upland cotton farms, distortions in Brazil's results, if any, would be very minor.
96 As the party asserting this fact, the United States bears the burden of proving it. See e.g. Appellate Body Report, Japan ­ Apples, WT/DS245/AB/R, para. 157 ("It is important to distinguish, on the one hand, the principle that the complainant must establish a prima facie case of inconsistency with a provision of a covered agreement from, on the other hand, the principle that the party that asserts a fact is responsible for providing proof thereof.").
97 See also US 11 January 2004 Comments, paras. 46-50. 98 Otherwise, all figures seem to reflect Brazil's calculations. 99 US 11 January 2004 Comments, paras. 46, 55 and note 50. 100 Brazil has addressed the US argument that off-farm income may be responsible for closing the gap between upland cotton market revenue and production costs in paragraph 28 of its 2 December 2003 Oral Statement. 101 US 18 November 2003 Further Rebuttal Submission, paras. 111, 137. Brazil is further puzzled by the fact that the United States argues for inclusion of off-farm income over which contract payments have to be allocated. In its 18 November 2003 Further Rebuttal Submission, the United States argued that off-farm income (such as social security benefits) could be support to upland cotton (para. 111). It follows that the United States would argue that social security benefits support the production of upland cotton, while contract payments support social security benefits. 102 Exhibit Bra-16 ("Characteristics and Production Costs of US Cotton Farms", USDA, October 2001, Appendix Tables 1-4 p. 23-26).

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-756
73. The United States also raises several issues with respect to Brazil's calculation methodology. The United States correctly points out that Brazil should have used yields on planted acreage, rather than applying yields on harvested acreage to all acreage planted.103 Brazil has corrected for this in its updated analysis, set out in Annex A.4 ­ albeit only for its calculation of the value of upland cotton production.104 Since yield information on planted acreage for other crops is not available to Brazil ­ assuming that the US allegation is correct and the yield data in Exhibit Bra-420 is, indeed, based on harvested acres ­ Brazil continues to apply this data with respect to planted acreage for other crops. Any bias caused by this inaccuracy will naturally overstate the value of the non-upland cotton crop production on upland cotton farms105 and, thus, undervalue the amount of contract payments constituting support to upland cotton.106
74. The United States also criticizes Brazil's exclusion of fruits and vegetables from the calculation of the value of non-contract payment crop plantings.107 However, the contract payment programmes themselves exclude fruits and vegetables as possible beneficiaries of that support, by prohibiting the growing of these crops on base acres. There is no legitimate reason to assume that these payments could be support to fruits and vegetables.108 In any event, Brazil notes that the United States required reporting of fruits, vegetables and wild rice acreage on all farms receiving contract payments from MY 1999-2002 and that the Panel has requested this information.109 Thus, the extent of any distortions, if any, can only be assessed when the actual data is reviewed.
75. Finally, the United States repeats its flawed arguments that contract payments have to be reduced by about two-thirds to reflect the fact that only upland cotton farms that own their land in fact benefit from contract payments.110 Brazil refers the Panel to its 28 January 2004 Comments for its arguments on this issue.111
76. In sum, none of the US criticisms summarized at paragraphs 57 and 60 of its 11 February 2004 Comments withstand close scrutiny. Brazil's calculations under the US Annex IV methodology, based on the incomplete non-farm-specific data, are not biased.112 By contrast, all of
103 US 11 February 2004 Comments, para. 52 note 59. 104 US 11 February 2004 Comments, para. 52 and accompanying table. 105 This is because the upland cotton value is correct, whereas all the values of all other crops are overstated, reducing the share of the upland cotton value of total crop production on the farm. 106 The United States also asserts, at paragraph 53 of its 11 February 2004 Comments, that Brazil should have used state-by-state data in the determination of the value of sales from non-contract payment crops. Brazil is puzzled by this US argument, as it was the United States that withheld the farm-specific data, including data that would have enabled Brazil to use state-by-state figures on non-contract payment crop plantings for the calculation of the value of non-contract payment crop plantings. The US summary data simply does not allow for a proper weighting of any state-by-state values of non-contract payments crop plantings, if such data were indeed available. Similarly, the US reference to farming in Alaska is irrelevant. Any value of production in that state would not meaningful affect aggregates for the United States. In fact, it would be the US burden to produce data that would allow for the application of its proposed methodology. As the party asserting a fact, the United States bears the burden of proving it. See e.g. Appellate Body Report, Japan ­ Apples, WT/DS245/AB/R, para. 157 ("It is important to distinguish, on the one hand, the principle that the complainant must establish a prima facie case of inconsistency with a provision of a covered agreement from, on the other hand, the principle that the party that asserts a fact is responsible for providing proof thereof."). 107 US 11 January 2004 Comments, para. 54. 108 See Section 6 above. See also Brazil's 28 January 2004 Comments and Requests Regarding US Data, paras. 92. Brazil's 20 January 2004 Answers to Questions, para. 73. 109 3 February 2004 Communication from the Panel. 110 US 11 February 2004 Comments, paras. 56, 60; See also US 28 January 2004 Comments, para. 22. 111 Brazil's 28 January 2004 Comments, paras. 192-214. 112 For instance, Brazil has used yields on harvested acres for all non-upland cotton planted acres, thereby significantly overstating the value of the non-upland cotton production and understating the amount of support allocated to upland cotton. In fact, Brazil's calculations are conservative.

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-757
the calculations presented by the United States in its 11 February 2004 Comments were improperly based on upland cotton contract payments only.113
8. Brazil Has Established, in the Alternative, the Amount of Contract Payments for Purposes of its SCM Serious Prejudice Claims
77. The United States 11 February 2004 Comments continue the US argument that there is an explicit allocation requirement in Part III of the SCM Agreement "for determining the `subsidization' of a product set out in Annex IV."114 The US Comments also argue that "Brazil has expressly disavowed any allocation methodology for purposes of its serious prejudice claims on decoupled income support payments [and has] failed to make a prima facie case on these claims."115 Both assertions are incorrect.
78. Brazil has argued that Part III of the SCM Agreement does not require detailing the precise amount of the subsidies or a subsidization rate.116 But it has presented evidence and argument, in the alternative, regarding the size and subsidization rate of the subsidies it has challenged.117 For the four contract payments, the subsidy quantities are those amounts generated for the purposes of the "peace clause" analysis. The amount of a subsidy for purposes of establishing "support to a specific commodity" for purposes of Article 13(b)(ii) is the same amount for Brazil's serious prejudice claims. This conclusion is supported by the fact that the phrase "domestic support" in the Agreement on Agriculture is the same as "subsidy" in the SCM Agreement (assuming the elements of a subsidy for the "support" have been established). Thus, Brazil has offered the contract payment quantities (as well as the other subsidies) established in the peace clause phase of the proceedings as the "amount of subsidization," to the extent this is required, in the serious prejudice phase of the proceedings.
9. The United States Improperly Seeks to Limit the Scope of the Non-Green Box Support Measures to be Examined for Determining the Amount of Support for Purposes of the Peace Clause
79. The United States' 11 February 2004 Comments argue that the Panel cannot examine any evidence of payments received by upland cotton producers growing upland cotton on non-upland cotton base acreage, because Brazil's request for the establishment of a panel ("Brazil's panel request") violates DSU Article 6.2.118 There is no factual or legal merit to these arguments.
80. First, the Panel's obligation is to conduct an objective assessment of the facts and arguments before it. The issue of the amount of contract payments is a key issue that is part of the broader question of the amount of support to upland cotton under Article 13(b)(ii) of the Agreement on Agriculture. This broader issue is ultimately the key legal question and it is clearly within the Panel's terms of reference. Determining the amount of support requires an objective assessment by the Panel as to the amount of non-green box support to producers and users of upland cotton in MY 1992 and MY 1999-2002. It requires the Panel to include all support to upland cotton from the evidence before it ­ regardless of whether Brazil's panel request is broad enough to encompass all of the same subsidies for the purpose of its serious prejudice claims. For example, the fact that the Panel has ruled
113 US 11 February 2004 Comments, paras. 58-59. 114 US 11 February 2004 Comments, paras. 20. 115 US 11 February 2004 Comments, paras. 22-24. 116 See e.g., Brazil's 11 February 2004 Comments on US Answers to Questions Posed by the Panel Following the Second Substantive Meeting of the Panel, paras. 196-197, 216; Brazil's 18 November 2003 Further Rebuttal Submission, paras. 97-107; Brazil's 2 December 2003 Oral Statement, paras 3-5. 117 See e.g., Brazil's 11 February 2004 Comments on US Answers to Questions Posed by the Panel Following the Second Substantive Meeting of the Panel, para.216; Brazil's 2 December 2003 Oral Statement , para. 5; Brazil's 9 September 2003 Further Submission, Table 1 (setting out the amount and rate of subsidization of each of the four contract payment subsidies based on the 14/16th Methodology). 118 US 11 February 2004 Data Comments, paras. 47-50.

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-758
that certain cottonseed payments are not within its terms of reference for purposes of Brazil's serious prejudice claims does not mean that these same subsidies cannot be counted as "support to upland cotton" for the purposes of the peace clause. The amount of these payments is within the Panel's terms of reference in order to resolve the peace clause issues, because they are "support to" upland cotton. Indeed, identical payments made in MY 1999 have been notified by the United States as "product-specific" upland cotton support.119
81. Second, with respect to the new US Article 6.2 assertion, Brazil notes that the US comments acknowledge that Brazil's panel request is broad enough to cover the contract payments received by upland cotton producers.120 But the United States now claims the request is too broad claiming it "provides virtually no information that would allow identification of the specific measure at issue".121 This argument is both untimely122 and contradicted by Brazil's request.
82. Brazil's request complied fully with DSU Article 6.2 by identifying the specific measures at issue. Brazil's request (1) identified by name the specific laws providing for contract payments, i.e., the 1996 FAIR Act, the 2002 FSRI Act, and the 1998-2001 appropriation acts for market loss assistance payments, (2) identified by name the specific payments, i.e., PFC, market loss assistance, direct and counter-cyclical payments, which were required to be paid from those laws, (3) identified by name the specific recipients of those payments, i.e., upland cotton producers, and (4) identified the specific time period when those payments were made, i.e., MY 1999-2007. Yet, the United States would read into DSU Article 6.2 a requirement to go to a further level of detail and identify the subcategory (i.e., payments on non-upland cotton and on upland cotton base acreage) of the specific measures that were identified (contract payments to upland cotton producers). This would impose an unprecedented and unjustified level of detail in a panel request that is not required by DSU Article 6.2.
83. In sum, it is undisputed that Brazil's panel request covered all types of contract payments to upland cotton producers, not just those based on upland cotton base acreage. Thus all types of contract payment provided to upland cotton producers, as properly allocated, are support to upland cotton that are well-within the Panel's terms of reference.
84. Finally, the United States now claims that its due process rights were somehow violated because Brazil did not present its methodology for allocating contract payments when it filed its first submission on 24 June 2004.123 This is simply not credible. Brazil did not realize until early November 2003 that the United States had inaccurately denied for almost one year that it did not have specific information that would allow the computation of the amount of contract payments received by upland cotton producers planting upland cotton.124 Without farm-specific data, there is no basis to develop, let alone apply, Brazil's methodology. Brazil could only develop a methodology to apply to actual data when it received the EWG data in mid-November, and when it then sought farm-specific
119 See Exhibit Bra-47 (G/AG/N/USA/43, p. 20). 120 US 11 February 2004 Comments, para. 48. 121 US 11 February 2004 Comments, para. 48. 122 Brazil notes that the United States did not make this assertion even at the Panel meeting of 23 December 2004 even though Brazil's 18 November 2003 Further Rebuttal Submission unequivocally stated that non-upland cotton contract payments were included when calculating the amount of contract support payments. For example, in Brazil's 18 November 2003 Further Rebuttal Submission, Brazil stated in paragraph 16 in presenting the EWG data that "the best evidence that would permit the Panel to calculate the most precise amount of support to upland cotton from these contract payments is (sic) amount of upland cotton (and other) contract acreage that is planted to upland cotton". The footnote to this statement indicated that "these payments include all contract payments for upland cotton base acreage and payments for other crop base acreage that are received by US producers of upland cotton." (emphasis added). 123 See US 16 February 2004 Letter to the Panel. 124 See Brazil's 18 February 2004 Comments on US Answers to Questions, para. 26 (setting out the chronology of Brazil's and the Panel's requests for information).

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-759
data from the United States.125 This methodology then would be applied to actual data, and replace Brazil's 14/16th methodology. Thus, it is disingenuous in the extreme for the United States to claim now126 that Brazil should have presented its methodology on 24 June 2003. Any delay in the United States receiving notice of Brazil's methodology is due directly to the regrettable pattern of US misrepresentations in this dispute beginning in December 2002.127 In any event, the United States' due process rights have hardly been violated, since they have had more than sufficient opportunity to comment on Brazil's methodology.128 Unfortunately, Brazil cannot say the same, since it has not been able to apply its methodology because the United States has not produced farm specific data requested by the Panel on several occasions.
10. The United States Arguments Concerning Various Issues Related to the Amount of Support "Decided" in MY 1992 Compared to the Amount Supported in MY 1999-2002 are without Merit
85. Brazil briefly responds to several arguments that the US level of support decided in MY 1999-2002 was less than that decided in MY 1992. The United States first argues that because it could not know in MY 1992 what its exact expenditures would be, it is inappropriate to use a budgetary outlay methodology for calculating the amount of support to upland cotton.129 Brazil will not repeat all of its arguments concerning the meaning of "decided" and "support provided".130 However, the United States cannot deny that when it passed the implementing Uruguay Round legislation and Congress approved the SAA in late 1994, it was well aware of all, or the vast majority of, the budgetary support for upland cotton provided in MY 1992. Had the United States been concerned about the certainty of its peace clause "protection", it would not have been difficult for Congress, in the 1996 FAIR Act or even the 2002 FSRI Act, to include a "circuit breaker" provision directing the USDA Secretary to stop funding of any upland cotton budgetary outlays in excess of the 1992 levels. Such a provision would have allowed the United States to ensure that it remained protected by the peace clause throughout the implementation period.131
125 See Brazil's 18 November 2003 Further Rebuttal Submission, para 16. 126 The United States points to questions raised by Brazil in the Annex V procedures ­ questions the United States refused to answer. US 11 February 2004 Data Comments, para. 69. While Brazil focused some of its questions on upland cotton base acreage, it also focused on total market loss assistance and CCP payments to the US upland cotton industry and US upland cotton farmers in Questions 11.1 and 13.1. Exhibit Bra-49 (Questions for Purpose of Annex V Procedure). Similarly, Brazil's questions 3.6 in the consultations focused on total amount of PFC and DP to "upland cotton" for marketing years 1992-2002, and question 11.1 asked for the "total amount of market loss assistance payments made to US upland cotton industry in marketing years 1998 through 2001". Exhibit Bra-101 (Questions for Purposes of the Consultations). Obviously, Brazil is not precluded from seeking information or arguing that "support to upland cotton" also included payments to upland cotton producers on non-cotton base acreage. No party is required to cast in stone its arguments concerning a never-before interpreted WTO Agreement in responding to hundreds of questions, exhibits, and more than a thousand pages of arguments. Given the 10 months of briefing in this extraordinary panel proceeding ­ and the US refusal to provide requested information ­ it is disingenuous for the United States to claim that Brazil is prevented from further elaborating on its methodologies for allocating contract payments. 127 Given the refusal of the United States for the past sixteen months to produce information regarding contract payments, it is incredible for the United States to argue that Brazil "has provided virtually no information that would allow identification of the specific measures at issue". US 11 February 2004 Comments, para. 48. 128 See US 11 February 2004 Comments, paras 35-43. 129 US 11 February 2004 Comments, para. 16. 130 Brazil's 22 August 2003 Rebuttal Submission, paras. 68-87; Brazil's 22 July 2003 Oral Statement, paras. 27-36. 131 Of course, the United States was not required to enact such a measure, because the "peace clause" does not create an obligation on Members to bring their laws into conformity, since it is in the nature of an affirmative defence.

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-760
86. Furthermore, the United States asserts that under any methodology of calculating "support to upland cotton", it provided support in MY 1999-2002 below the level of support decided in MY ^1992.132 The United States performs this legal magic by (1) making $4.7 billion in contract payments133, including a billion dollars of CCP upland cotton payments in MY 2002 alone, simply disappear, (2) assuming that $5.5 billion134 in marketing loan payments were never made by applying a price-gap support methodology it never actually used or notified,135 and (3) imposing its "statute of limitations" calculation to end MY 2002 payments on 18 March 2002.136 Brazil has addressed all of these creative attempts to cover-up billions of dollars in support payments and will not repeat them here.
11. The United States Comments Regarding the Appellate Body's Japan ­ Agricultural Products Decision Are Misplaced
87. Brazil has studied the US comments regarding Japan ­ Agricultural Products137 carefully and believes Brazil's initial analysis of the decision largely addresses the points raised in the US comments.138 The United States continues to incorrectly interpret Japan ­ Agricultural Products by confusing "claims" with "arguments". The United States argues in paragraph 33 of its 11 February 2004 Comments that because Brazil allegedly has not argued that Annex IV is the proper methodology, the Panel cannot request information from the United States relevant to the application of that methodology.139 But Japan ­ Agricultural Products stands for the proposition that a Panel cannot make a "claim" for a party, i.e., a legal claim that would be required to be set out in a request for the establishment of a panel. It does not stand for the proposition that a panel is prevented from requesting information from a party that would be relevant to determine the merits of arguments made by that same party.
88. Further, the United States' entire premise in relying on Japan ­ Agricultural Products is wrong. In its 28 January 2004 Comments and Requests Regarding US Data, Brazil has made an
132 US 11 February 2004 Comments, para. 17 and accompanying notes. 133 This figure is based on Brazil's 14/16th methodology, but all other methodologies performed in Annex A generate very similar amounts of support to upland cotton from the four contract payment programmes. 134 See Brazil's 2 December 2003 Oral Statement, Section 5.2. 135 See US 22 August 2003 Rebuttal Submission, paras. 114-119. See Brazil's response in its 27 August 2003 Comments, paras. 10-16 and Brazil's 28 January 2004 Comments, paras. 29-36. 136 US 11 August 2003 Answer to Questions, para. 69, 133-134; US 22 August 2003 Rebuttal Submission, para. 115 note 145.

"argument," in the alternative, regarding a methodology proposed by the United States. The Panel's 3 February 2004 request for information on non-contract acreage crops grown by upland cotton producers was entirely consistent with the United States' suggestion of the US Annex IV methodology and with Brazil's attempt in its 28 January 2004 comments to apply the US Annex IV methodology. The United States responded to Brazil's argument on 11 February 2004. There is no doubt that receipt of the non-contract acreage crops grown on cotton farms would allow a more precise tabulation of the amount of payments using the Annex IV methodology. Thus, the Panel's various requests are fully consistent with the holding by the Appellate Body in Japan ­ Agricultural Products that a "panel is entitled to seek information ... to help it understand and evaluate the evidence submitted and the arguments made by the parties."140

Annex A
Calculation of Contract Payment Support to Upland Cotton
1. In this Annex, Brazil sets forth the details of its calculation of contract payments that constitute support to upland cotton, within the meaning of Article 13 of the Agreement on Agriculture. All of Brazil's calculations are based on the revised US summary files produced on 28 January 2004 and other USDA documents provided as exhibits to the Panel. Brazil explains its calculations either in the narrative of this annex or in the footnotes accompanying the tables.
1. Upland Cotton Contract Payments Only
2. The calculations in this section are based on the presumption that only upland cotton contract payments would be relevant for calculating support to upland cotton. As Brazil has explained in the main text of these comments, Brazil strongly opposes the US arguments that all non-upland cotton contract payments have to be excluded from the calculation of support to upland cotton. All contract payments, including those made on non-upland cotton base acreage, are properly within the Panel's terms of reference. Further, the Panel needs to include all contract payments, including those made on non-upland cotton base acreage, in its objective evaluation of the applicability of the peace clause exemption. Nevertheless, Brazil provides below the necessary calculations for allocating only upland cotton contract payments as "support to" upland cotton.
3. These calculations are performed in two different manners: First, the total amount of upland cotton contract payments to farms actually producing upland cotton is calculated. Second, the amount of upland cotton contract payments to farms actually producing upland cotton is adjusted pursuant to the amount of upland cotton actually produced by farms holding upland cotton base. Under this approach, only upland cotton payments for upland cotton base acres that are actually planted to upland cotton would be considered support to upland cotton. Since plantings of upland cotton on farms also holding upland cotton base exceed the upland cotton base acreage in MY 1999-2001,1 the adjustment only affects MY 2002 figures.2
4. The first step is performed by multiplying the amount of upland cotton payments units on farms producing upland cotton and holding upland cotton base3 (as reported by the United States in its 28 January 2004 summary files) by the applicable payment rate for upland cotton in each of the marketing years 1999-2002.
1 See rPFCsum.xls and rDPCsum.xls files provided by the United States on 28 January 2004. 2 Both approaches exclude any non-upland cotton contract payments received by farms that produce upland cotton and (1) hold upland cotton base, or (2) do not hold upland cotton base (but possible other base). 3 These farms are called "1" in the rPFCsum.xls file and "Enrolled in Cotton PFC and planted cotton" in the rDCPsum.xls file. Presumably the latter should be called "Enrolled in Cotton DCP and planted cotton."

7. As the Panel can see, the results of this methodology are not considerably different from the results of Brazil's 14/16th methodology.

4 Payment Units for MY 1999-2001 are taken from category "1" farms from the rPFCsum.xls file
provided by the United States on 28 January 2004. Payment Units for MY 2002 are taken from the
rDCPsum.xls file provided by the United States on 28 January 2004. 5 Exhibit Bra-394 (Agricultural Outlook Tables, USDA, November 2003, Table 19). 6 Subsidy Amount = Payment Units * Payment Rate. 7 See Table 1.1 for the underlying calculations. 8 Market Loss Assistance Payments are calculated as PFC payments multiplied by the ratio of upland
cotton market loss assistance payments to upland cotton PFC payments, as contained in Exhibit Bra-4 ("Fact
Sheet: Upland Cotton," USDA, January 2003, p. 6). Since payment rates are not available directly, this ratio
provides the information because both subsidies are paid based off the same payment units. Brazil notes that the
market loss assistance payment amounts are understated by the non-allocated amount of soybean market loss
assistance payments for which the United States has not produced any information.

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-765

8. In a second step, Brazil adjusts the above calculated subsidy amount pursuant to the amount
of upland cotton actually planted on farms holding upland cotton base. These calculations are
possible distorted due to the aggregation problems discussed in Brazil's 20 January 2004 Comments and Requests Regarding US Data.9 The adjustment factor is calculated as the ratio of upland cotton
planted acreage to upland cotton base acreage (capped a 1).

10. For purposes of comparison, Brazil reproduces the results of its "14/16th" methodology, as presented to the Panel at paragraphs 8 of Brazil's 22 December 2003 Answers to Questions and Brazil's 9 September Further Submission.

9 See inter alia Brazil's 28 January 2004 Comments and Requests Regarding US Data, paras. 13-15. 10 Upland Cotton Planted Acreage for MY 1999-2001 are taken from category "1" farms from the
rPFCsum.xls file provided by the United States on 28 January 2004. Upland Cotton Planted Acreage for MY
2002 is taken from "Enrolled in Cotton PFC and planted cotton" farms from the rDCPsum.xls file provided by
the United States on 28 January 2004. 11 Upland Cotton Base Acreage for MY 1999-2001 are taken from category "1" farms from the
rPFCsum.xls file provided by the United States on 28 January 2004. Upland Cotton Base Acreage for MY 2002
is taken from "Enrolled in Cotton PFC and planted cotton" farms from the rDCPsum.xls file provided by the
United States on 28 January 2004. 12 Ratio = Upland Cotton Planted Acreage / Upland Cotton Base Acreage. 13 The Adjustment Factor equals the Ratio of Upland Cotton Planted Acreage to Upland Cotton Base
Acreage capped at 1. This means all upland cotton contract payments are deemed to be support to upland cotton
if more (or equal) upland cotton is planted than there is upland cotton base. If upland cotton plantings are short
of upland cotton base, only the respective ratio is considered to be support to upland cotton. 14 Market Loss Assistance Payments are calculated as PFC payments multiplied by the ratio of upland
cotton market loss assistance payments to upland cotton PFC payments, as contained in Exhibit Bra-4 ("Fact
Sheet: Upland Cotton," USDA, January 2003, p. 6). Since payment rates are not available directly, this ratio
provides the information because both subsidies are paid based off the same payment units. Brazil notes that the
market loss assistance payment amounts are understated by the non-allocated amount of soybean market loss
assistance payments for which the United States has not produced any information.

11. The results of this methodology are only marginally below the results of Brazil's 14/16th
methodology, although this methodology would assume that upland cotton produced on farms that do
not hold upland cotton base would not receive any contract payments at all, and that upland cotton
contract payments on farms that produce upland cotton and hold base would only allocated up to the
share of contract acreage that is actually planted to upland cotton. The reason for the close similarity between the 14/16th methodology and the cotton-to-cotton methodology results is that the
overwhelming majority of upland cotton is planted on upland cotton base (86.34 per cent in MY 1999, 82.05 per cent in MY 2000, 80.10 per cent in MY 2001 and 96.17 per cent in MY 2002).15
2. Brazil's (Simplified) Allocation Methodology

12. In this section of Annex A, Brazil provides an update of its calculations in Section 9 of its 28 January 2004 Comments and Requests Regarding US Data taking into account the revised summary data produced by the United States on 28 January 2004. Brazil has discussed its methodology in considerable detail in its 20 January 2004 response to Question 25816 and has applied it in Section 9 of its 28 January 2004 Comments and Requests Regarding US Data. Brazil recalls that its methodology considers as support to a particular crop all crop contract payments for that crop that are made for base acres actually planted to that crop. All remaining support is pooled and allocated as support to contract crops according to their share of total "overplanted" contract crop acreage on a farm.

13. While the revised US summary data provided on 28 January 2004 neither addresses the
aggregation problems resulting from the particular manner in which the United States produced its summary data,17 nor the shortcomings in terms of soybean market loss assistance payments and
peanut direct and counter-cyclical payments, the United States provides information on contract base
of farms that plant upland cotton, but do not hold upland cotton base. To reflect this additional information, Brazil has updated its earlier calculations.18

14. In a first step, Brazil analyses farms that plant upland cotton and hold upland cotton base. By marketing year, the following four tables provide, first, by crop the total amount of contract payments received by farms that produce upland cotton and hold upland cotton base.

15 Calculated as the share of upland cotton production planted on farms holding upland cotton base (up
to the amount of upland cotton base) of total upland cotton plantings. MY 1999-2001 data are taken from
category "1" farms and total upland cotton planting from the rPFCsum.xls file provided by the United States on
28 January 2004. Data for MY 2002 is taken from "Enrolled in Cotton PFC and planted cotton" farms and total
upland cotton plantings from the rDCPsum.xls file provided by the United States on 28 January 2004. 16 Brazil's 20 January 2004 Answers to Additional Questions, paras. 43-55. 17 No such aggregation problem exists with respect to the summary data as requested by the Panel on
3 February 2004. 18 Since there are also minor changes to the summary data on farms that plant upland cotton and hold
upland cotton base, Brazil has recalculated all of the figures presented in Section 9 of its 28 January 2004
Comments and Requests Regarding US Data following the very same calculation methodology.

units are expressed in US$ per pound rather than in US$ per hundredweight as reported in that exhibit (i.e.,

small and payment rates were not available to Brazil. Any distortion resulting from this omission would only
reduce the amount of contract payments that are considered support to upland cotton. 29 Payment Units for MY 2002 are taken from category "Enrolled in Cotton PFC and planed cotton"
farms from the rDCPsum.xls file provided by the United States on 28 January 2004. 30 Exhibit Bra-394 (Agricultural Outlook Tables, USDA, November 2003, Table 19). Rice payment

16. Since planted acreage exceeds base acreage only for upland cotton, the entire amount of 1999
PFC payments available for allocation ($40,977,701.8) is allocated to upland cotton. Therefore the
amount of PFC payments that constitute support to upland cotton on farms planting upland cotton and holding upland cotton base in MY 1999 is $556,288,375.2.37

32 Additional PFC payments will be allocated as support to upland cotton on farms that produce upland
cotton but do not hold upland cotton base, as discussed below. 33 Contract Acres for MY 1999 are taken from category "1" farms from the rPFCsum.xls file provided
by the United States on 28 January 2004. 34 Planted Acres for MY 1999 are taken from category "1" farms from the rPFCsum.xls file provided
by the United States on 28 January 2004. 35 The subsidy allocated is the entire amount of contract payments for that crop if planted acreage
exceeds or equals base acreage. The subsidy allocated is amount of contract payments for that crop adjusted by
the ratio of planted acreage to base acreage if planted acreage is below base acreage. (see Table 2.1 for the
calculation of the total MY 1999 PFC payment by crop). 36 The amount of subsidy available for allocation to other contract payment crops is the residuum of
crop contract payments that has not been allocated to the respective crop because planted acreage was below
base acreage. 37 Additional PFC payments will be allocated as support to upland cotton on farms that produce upland
cotton but do not hold upland cotton base, as discussed below.

17. Since planted acreage exceeds base acreage only for upland cotton, the entire amount of 2000
PFC payments available for allocation ($37,483,895.1) is allocated to upland cotton. Therefore the
amount of PFC payments that constitute support to upland cotton on farms planting upland cotton and holding upland cotton base in MY 2000 is $519,906,241.1.42

38 Contract Acres for MY 2000 are taken from category "1" farms from the rPFCsum.xls file provided
by the United States on 28 January 2004. 39 Planted Acres for MY 2000 are taken from category "1" farms from the rPFCsum.xls file provided
by the United States on 28 January 2004. 40 The subsidy allocated is the entire amount of contract payments for that crop if planted acreage
exceeds or equals base acreage. The subsidy allocated is amount of contract payments for that crop adjusted by
the ratio of planted acreage to base acreage if planted acreage is below base acreage. (see Table 2.2 for the
calculation of the total MY 2000 PFC payment by crop). 41 The amount of subsidy available for allocation to other contract payment crops is the residuum of
crop contract payments that has not been allocated to the respective crop because planted acreage was below
base acreage. 42 Additional PFC payments will be allocated as support to upland cotton on farms that produce upland
cotton but do not hold upland cotton base, as discussed below.

20. Since in MY 2002, the amount of upland cotton acreage (13,022,668.9 acres54) on farms that
planted upland cotton and held upland cotton base was below the amount of upland cotton base (13,818,215.255), no additional contract payments would be allocated. Instead, the amount of support
to upland cotton is calculated by multiplying the amount of upland cotton direct and counter-cyclical payments on these farms by 0.94243.56 The table below shows the amount of payments allocated as
support to upland cotton.

22. The next four sets of calculations indicate the amount of base and planted acreage for each
crop and the amount of crop contract payments allocated to each crop as well as the amount of
contract payments available for further allocation to other crops. They finally also indicate the
amount of contract payments that constitute support to upland cotton on farms that plant upland cotton but do not hold upland cotton base.73

69 Brazil has not calculated the amounts of payments for other minor oilseeds, as the figures were so
small and payment rates were not available to Brazil. Any distortion resulting from this omission would only
reduce the amount of contract payments that are considered support to upland cotton. 70 Payment Units for MY 2002 are taken from category "Not Enrolled in Cotton PFC and planed

cotton" farms from the rDCPsum.xls file provided by the United States on 28 January 2004. 94 Contract Acres for MY 2002 are taken from category "Not Enrolled in Cotton PFC and planted
cotton" farms from the rDCPsum.xls file provided by the United States on 28 January 2004. 95 The subsidy allocated is the entire amount of contract payments for that crop if planted acreage
exceeds or equals base acreage. The subsidy allocated is amount of contract payments for that crop adjusted by
the ratio of planted acreage to base acreage if planted acreage is below base acreage. (see Table 2.14 for the
calculation of the total MY 2002 direct payment by crop). 96 The amount of subsidy available for allocation to other contract payment crops is the residuum of
crop contract payments that has not been allocated to the respective crop because planted acreage was below
base acreage. 97 Contract Acres for MY 2002 are taken from category "Not Enrolled in Cotton PFC and planted
cotton" farms from the rDCPsum.xls file provided by the United States on 28 January 2004. 98 Planted Acres for MY 2002 are taken from category "Not Enrolled in Cotton PFC and planted

for allocation as calculated in the "Subsidy Available for Allocation" column in Table 2.17. 101 Additional Subsidy Allocated = Share of Total Overplanted Base * Total Subsidy Available for
Allocation.

28. The total amount of MY 2002 counter-cyclical payments that is available for allocation over crops whose planted acreage exceeds their base acreage is allocated as detailed in the following table:

102 Additional direct payments will be allocated as support to upland cotton on farms that produce
upland cotton and hold upland cotton base, as discussed above. 103 Brazil has not calculated the amounts of payments for other minor oilseeds, as the figures were so
small and payment rates were not available to Brazil. Any distortion resulting from this omission would only
reduce the amount of contract payments that are considered support to upland cotton. 104 Contract Acres for MY 2002 are taken from category "Not Enrolled in Cotton PFC and planted
cotton" from the rDCPsum.xls file provided by the United States on 28 January 2004. 105 Planted Acres for MY 2002 are taken from category "Not Enrolled in Cotton PFC and planted

the ratio of planted acreage to base acreage if planted acreage is below base acreage. (see Table 2.14 for the

crop contract payments that has not been allocated to the respective crop because planted acreage was below
base acreage.

108 Contract Acres for MY 2002 are taken from category "Not Enrolled in Cotton PFC and planted

cotton" farms from the rDCPsum.xls file provided by the United States on 28 January 2004. 110 See Total in the preceding column 111 The figures in this column represent the total of the amount of MY 2002 direct payments available
for allocation as calculated in the "Subsidy Available for Allocation" column in Table 2.17. 112 Additional Subsidy Allocated = Share of Total Overplanted Base * Total Subsidy Available for
Allocation. 113 Additional counter-cyclical payments will be allocated as support to upland cotton on farms that
produce upland cotton and hold upland cotton base, as discussed above. 114 These figures have been calculated as the sum of the contract payments allocated as support to
upland cotton on farms that either hold or do not hold upland cotton base and produce upland cotton. 115 Market Loss Assistance Payments are calculated as PFC payments multiplied by the ratio of upland
cotton market loss assistance payments to upland cotton PFC payments, as contained in Exhibit Bra-4 ("Fact
Sheet: Upland Cotton," USDA, January 2003, p. 6). Since payment rates are not available directly, this ratio
provides the information because both subsidies are paid based off the same payment units. Brazil notes that the
market loss assistance payment amounts are understated by the non-allocated amount of soybean market loss
assistance payments for which the United States has not produced any information.

32. As the Panel can readily see, both methodologies produce quite similar results.

3. Annex IV-Type Methodology Over Contract Crop Values Only

33. The calculations in this section apply an Annex IV-type allocation methodology to all contract payments received by farms that produce upland cotton, whether or not those farms hold upland cotton base. The approach is the same as in Section 10 of Brazil's 28 January Comments and Requests Regarding US Data. ­ with the sole exception that the allocation is performed only over the value of programme crops produced on the farm, rather than over the entire value of the upland cotton farms (crop) production.116

34. As a first step, Brazil tabulates the total amount of contract payments received by farms that produce upland cotton, as calculated in Section 2 above. The following four tables show the results of this calculation indicating the amount of contract payments by contract payment crop.

35. In a second step the value of all contract payment crops produced on farms that also produce upland cotton is determined. Therefore, the total amount of acreage planted to each of the contract payment crops is multiplied by the average yield and the average farm price for the crop. This is shown in the following four tables.

126 Brazil has not calculated the amounts of payments for other minor oilseeds, as the figures were so
small and payment rates were not available to Brazil. Any distortion resulting from this omission would only
reduce the amount of contract payments that are considered support to upland cotton. 127 See Table 2.4 for the calculations resulting in these subsidy figures. 128 See Table 2.13 for the calculations resulting in these subsidy figures. 129 Sum of the two preceding columns

37. Finally, Brazil applies these percentages (the share of upland cotton value of total contract payment crop value) to the total amount of contract payments, as calculated in the first step. The resulting figures represent the total amount of contract payments that constitute support to upland cotton under this methodology. The following table shows the amount of support to upland cotton if an Annex IV-type methodology is applied to allocate the value of contract payments over the total value of contract crops produced on farms that also produce upland cotton.

145 Brazil has not calculated the amounts of payments for other minor oilseeds, as the figures were so
small and payment rates were not available to Brazil. Any distortion resulting from this omission would only
reduce the amount of contract payments that are considered support to upland cotton. 146 Planted Acres for MY 2002 are taken from category "Enrolled in Cotton PFC and planted cotton"
farms from the rDCPsum.xls file provided by the United States on 28 January 2004. 147 Planted Acres for MY 2002 are taken from category "Not Enrolled in Cotton PFC and planted
cotton" farms from the rDCPsum.xls file provided by the United States on 28 January 2004. 148 Upland cotton yields per planted acre (adjusted for abandonment) are taken from Exhibit Bra-4
("Fact Sheet: Upland Cotton," USDA, January 2003, p. 4). All other yields are taken from Exhibit Bra-420
(Agricultural Outlook Tables, November 2003, Table 17). If these yields should constitute yields on harvested
acres (the USDA document relied on by Brazil does not provide this information), then the use of these figures
would bias the results leading to lower allocations for upland cotton. No other yield figures are available to
Brazil. 149 Average farm prices are taken from Exhibit Bra-420 (Agricultural Outlook Tables, November 2003,
Table 17). 150 Total Value = (Crop Plantings on Farms Holding Upland Cotton Base + Crop Plantings on Farms
Not Holding Upland Cotton Base) * Average Yield * Farm Price per Unit. 151 These figures have been calculated as "Total Value" of upland cotton divided by "Total Value" of
all crops reported in Tables 3.5-3.8.

4. US-Proposed Annex IV Methodology

39. In this section, Brazil provides updated calculations for allocating contract payments over the entire sales of crops produced on farms producing upland cotton.154 In Section 3 of this annex, Brazil
calculated the total amounts of contract payments received by farms producing upland cotton
(Tables 3.1-3.4). Brazil also calculated the value of the contract programme crop production on farms
producing upland cotton (Tables 3.5-3.8). To avoid repetition, Brazil refers to Panel to these calculations.

40. While the revised US summary data provided on 28 January 2004 neither addresses the
aggregation problems resulting from the particular manner in which the United States produced its summary data,155 nor the shortcomings in terms of soybean market loss assistance payments and
peanut direct and counter-cyclical payments, the United States provides information on contract base
of farms that plant upland cotton, but do not hold upland cotton base. To reflect this additional information, Brazil has updated its earlier calculations.156

152 These figures have been calculated by multiplying the percentage amount in Table 3.9 by the total
amount of PFC, direct and counter-cyclical payments in Tables 3.1-3.4. 153 Market Loss Assistance Payments are calculated as PFC payments multiplied by the ratio of upland
cotton market loss assistance payments to upland cotton PFC payments, as contained in Exhibit Bra-4 ("Fact
Sheet: Upland Cotton", USDA, January 2003, p. 6). Since payment rates are not available directly, this ratio
provides the information because both subsidies are paid based off the same payment units. Brazil notes that the
market loss assistance payment amounts are understated by the non-allocated amount of soybean market loss
assistance payments for which the United States has not produced any information. 154 Brazil's original calculations are contained in Section 10 of its 28 January 2004 Comments and
Requests Regarding US Data. 155 No such aggregation problem exists with respect to the summary data as requested by the Panel on 3
February 2004. 156 Since there are also minor changes to the summary data on farms that plant upland cotton and hold
upland cotton base, Brazil has recalculated all of the figures presented in Section 10 of its 28 January 2004
Comments and Requests Regarding US Data following the very same calculation methodology.

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-789

41. Allocating the total amount of contract payments over the entire sales of crops produced on farms that also produce upland cotton requires determining the value of the non-programme crop production on these farms. In a first step, Brazil calculates the amount of acreage planted to nonprogramme crops on farms that produce upland cotton.

ANNEX I-23

COMMENTS OF THE UNITED STATES TO THE 18 FEBRUARY 2004 COMMENTS OF BRAZIL
3 March 2004
Introduction
1. The United States thanks the Panel for this opportunity to provide comments on the 18 February comments filed by Brazil relating to the data submitted by the United States on 18 And 19 December 2003. As an initial matter, the United States finds it odd that Brazil's 18 February comments advance a number of new arguments concerning the applicability of the Peace Clause at this late stage in the proceedings, long after the time when the Peace Clause portion of the dispute was supposed to have been concluded. This only demonstrates the shifting nature of Brazil's arguments and approach to the legal provisions at issue.
2. In these comments, we proceed as follows:
· First, the United States sets forth how Brazil's arguments on the use of the December data are mistaken because of Brazil's erroneous interpretation of the Peace Clause phrase "support to a specific commodity."
· Second, we rebut Brazil's argument that support to a specific commodity may be determined by an analysis of whether the payment in question "cover[s] (or contribute[s] to) the costs of production of a crop." Brazil's "costs of production" principle finds no support in the text of the Peace Clause or of any WTO agreement and in fact collapses when applied to its logical conclusion.
· Third, we demonstrate that Brazil's argument that decoupled income support payments are de facto tied to production is in error.
· Fourth, we explain that Brazil has not made a prima facie case under its subsidies claims with respect to decoupled payments because it has failed to advance evidence and arguments to allow for identification of the challenged subsidy and subsidized product.
· Fifth, we demonstrate that Brazil's various allocation methodologies, in addition to being irrelevant for Peace Clause Purposes and inapplicable for serious prejudice claims, are internally inconsistent and illogical and that its so-called "Annex IV" methodologies are in fact unrelated to the text of Annex IV.
· Finally, we conclude by noting that Brazil's interpretation of the Peace Clause and application of the December data would upset the balance of rights and obligations of members in the WTO agreements.

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-797
Brazil Misinterprets the Peace Clause1 Phrase, "Support to a Specific Commodity"
3. We begin by noting that the entirety of section 2, and many other parts, of Brazil's comments are based on an argument that Brazil invents and falsely ascribes to the United States. Brazil seeks to paint the US interpretation of the Peace Clause proviso as "based on" an understanding that "`support to' means `tied to' the production of a specific commodity" ­ that is, that "support to" in Article 13(b)(ii) of the Agreement on Agriculture means something like "tied to the production or sale of a given product" in paragraph 3 of Annex IV of the Subsidies Agreement.2 Brazil's argument, however, is not based on any submission of the United States since the United States has never linked the Peace Clause to Annex IV. Indeed, in the US February 11 comments, we specifically noted that:
[T]he terms "support to a specific commodity" and "product-specific support" are not found in Part III of the Subsidies Agreement, nor in Article 1 or Annex IV. Neither are the terms "subsidy," "benefit," or "subsidized product" from the Subsidies Agreement found in the Peace Clause proviso or any supporting text. Thus, the plain language of the Peace Clause and [Subsidies Agreement] Articles 5 and 6 indicate that these provisions refer to wholly different approaches and suggest that the methodology for allocating non-tied (decoupled) payments under the Subsidies Agreement may not be relevant under the Agreement on Agriculture. The definitions of product-specific support and non-product-specific support in Article 1(a) of the Agreement on Agriculture confirm that the Annex IV allocation methodology does not apply for purposes of the Peace Clause.3
Thus, contrary to Brazil's assertions, the United States is plainly not inappropriately attempting to interpret the phrase "support to" in the Peace Clause in light of the phrase "tied to" in Annex IV.4 Having laid down a patently incorrect understanding of the US argument, Brazil proceeds never to address the true bases for the US interpretation of the Peace Clause phrase "support to a specific commodity".
4. Although Brazil correctly suggests that the Panel should look to the ordinary meaning of the phrase "support to a specific commodity," it only provides a dictionary definition for one term in the phrase, "support" ("assistance, backing").5 Brazil's reliance on "support" is misplaced. When Brazil states: "The issue under Article 13(b)(ii) is whether a particular commodity receives `backing' or support' from a domestic support measure," Brazil fundamentally misunderstands the issue.6 "Nonproduct-specific support" is also "support" to various agricultural commodities. The simple fact that it supports those commodities (on a non-specific basis) does not thereby convert that support into
1 In paragraph 19 of Brazil's 18 February comments, Brazil in passing characterizes the Peace Clause as "now-expired". As the United States has explained earlier in this proceeding, the issue of the date of expiration of the Peace Clause is not at issue in this proceeding. Brazil accepts that the Peace Clause was in effect when the Panel was established. However, the United States has also explained that the Peace Clause has not yet expired for the United States or other Members whose relevant "year" began later in 1995, so Brazil's characterization is inaccurate as well.
2 Brazil's 18 February Comments, para. 3. 3 US February 11 Comments, para. 20 (footnote omitted). 4 Similarly, we are puzzled by Brazil's lengthy argument in section 4 of its comments that it is the US position that "only Annex IV of the SCM Agreement offers any useful context" to finding some methodology to apply to decoupled payments for purposes of the Peace Clause analysis. Brazil's 18 February Comments, paras. 38-41. As set out above, the Peace Clause determination is made on the basis of its text in its context; the United States does not rely on Annex IV as context or otherwise for interpretation of the Peace Clause; and no methodology to allocate non-product-specific support to a specific commodity can be found in the Agreement on Agriculture. 5 Brazil's 18 February Comments, para. 3. 6 Brazil's 18 February Comments, para. 6.

support to a "specific commodity" for purposes of Article 13(b)(ii). In addition, by solely defining "support," Brazil avoids the ordinary meaning of the phrase as a whole ­ that is, "assistance" or "backing" "specially . . . pertaining to a particular" "agricultural crop"7 ­ a meaning which runs directly contrary to Brazil's approach under which support to multiple commodities is at the same time support to particular commodities. Brazil not only fails to look to the ordinary meaning of all of the terms in this phrase8, it also fails to read the phrase "support to a specific commodity" in light of any other provision of the Agreement on Agriculture (the most immediate context for the Peace Clause) that contains any of the terms "support," "specific," or "commodity".9
5. For example, the phrase "support to a specific commodity" contains elements found in the phrases product-specific and non-product-specific support ­ but Brazil denies that those concepts have any relevance to the Peace Clause.10 Brazil also fails to discuss (and therefore presumably believes irrelevant) the similarities between the phrase "support to a specific commodity" and the phrases "support . . . provided for an agricultural product in favour of the producers of the basic agricultural product" (Article 1(a)) and "support for basic agricultural products" (Article 1(h)), which, respectively, define and refer to product-specific support (without using those exact words). Brazil's interpretation of the Peace Clause phrase "support to a specific commodity", in addition to ignoring the ordinary meaning of the phrase as a whole, ignores relevant context as well ­ that is, those phrases in the Agreement on Agriculture that, because of their close similarities, must inform a valid interpretation.
6. As we have previously noted, "support to a specific commodity" must be read not only according to the ordinary meaning of the terms, but also in light of the structure of the Agreement on Agriculture. Brazil asserts that Members would have used the exact phrase "product-specific support" instead of "support to a specific commodity" if they had meant the two to be read as having the same meaning,11 but Brazil sets up a false dichotomy. The Agreement elsewhere defines (Article 1(a)) and refers to (Article 1(h)) this concept without using that exact phrase. Indeed, the Agreement on Agriculture nowhere uses the exact phrase "product-specific support". A close approximation is the phrase "product-specific domestic support" in Article 6.4(a)(i); in Annex 3, paragraph 1, the term "product-specific" is used in the context of describing the AMS to be calculated for each basic agricultural product.12 Despite the absence in the text of the exact phrase "productspecific support", even Brazil has no difficulty recognizing that such a concept exists in the Agreement on Agriculture; thus, that the exact phrase "product-specific support" was not used in the
7 See US First Written Submission, para. 77 (July 11, 2003) (citing dictionary definitions of each term). 8 According to the customary rules of interpretation of public international law, the Agreement is to "be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose." See Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, Article 31 (General rule of interpretation). 9 See, e.g., Agreement on Agriculture, Articles 1(a), 1(d), 1(f), 6.4, and Annex 3 (paragraphs 1 and 7). 10 Instead, Brazil claims that all of its arguments relating to product-specific support and non-productspecific support have been arguments "in the alternative." Brazil also faults the United States for "falsely assert[ing] that Brazil has `conceded that `support to a specific commodity' refers to `product-specific support.'" Brazil's 18 February Comments, paras. 9-10. The United States notes that the Brazilian statement previously referred to by the United States (that is, "the support from contract payments that can be allocated to upland cotton is product-specific support within the meaning of the Agreement on Agriculture", Brazil's 28 January Comments, para. 73) did not contain any indication that it was made "in the alternative". Nonetheless, in these comments, the United States proceeds as if Brazil's 18 February comments are its final position. 11 Brazil's February 18 Comments, para. 5 ("Negotiators presumably knew what they intended when they used the very particular term `product-specific support'. They used the term repeatedly in the Agreement on Agriculture, and even defined `non-product-specific support in Article 1(a) ­ yet they declined to use `product-specific support' in Article 13(b)(ii)".). 12 See Agreement on Agriculture, Annex 3, para. 1 ("Subject to the provisions of Article 6, an Aggregate Measurement of Support (AMS) shall be calculated on a product-specific basis for each basic agricultural product receiving market price support, non-exempt direct payments, or any other subsidy not exempted from the reduction commitment (`other non-exempt policies').").

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-799
Peace Clause is no bar to finding that this is the correct interpretation of "support to a specific commodity".13
7. In addition, Brazil's suggestion that "support to a specific commodity" was intended to clarify that the Peace Clause test involves only "support to an individual commodity, not a group of commodities such as grains or even all commodities"14, does not withstand scrutiny.
· First, the phrase "support to a commodity," without the use of the word "specific", conveys the same meaning as "support to an individual commodity" (Brazil's proffered interpretation); thus, Brazil's interpretation renders the use of the term "specific" inutile.
· Second, under Brazil's interpretation of the Peace Clause, support to "a group of commodities" or "even all commodities" could be support to a specific commodity because the payments may be allocated to an individual commodity depending on what the recipient produces. Thus, Brazil's own Peace Clause interpretation contradicts this distinction between "support to an individual commodity" and support "to a group of commodities".
In addition, Brazil's suggestion that "the chapeau of Article 13(b)(ii) confirms this broader meaning of `support,' because it includes all types of non-green box measures"15, simply begs the question. "Domestic support measures that conform fully to the provisions of Article 6" (the language in the chapeau) may be either product-specific or non-product-specific, and even Brazil would agree that non-product-specific support is not "support to a specific commodity". Thus, just because a measure falls within the Article 13(b)(ii) chapeau does not assist in determining whether that measure provides "support to a specific commodity".
8. What may be most striking about the Brazilian critique of the US reading of the Peace Clause is that it nowhere presents nor rebuts the basis for the US interpretation. The basis for the US interpretation is set out plainly in the US February 11 comments:
The lack of grounding of Brazil's methodology in the WTO agreements stems from its erroneous interpretation of "support to a specific commodity." . . . . Brazil has consistently failed to read together the definitions of product-specific support and non-product-specific support in Article 1(a) of the Agreement on Agriculture. Read in conjunction with one another, non-product-specific support ("support provided in favour of agricultural producers in general") is a residual category of support that is not product-specific ("support . . . provided for an agricultural product in favour of the producers of the basic agricultural product").16
Brazil nowhere addresses the US argument relating to the definition of product-specific support in Article 1(a) of the Agreement on Agriculture. In fact, whereas in Brazil's Peace Clause submissions it serially misquoted the definition of product-specific support in Article 1(a), dropping key words,17 in its 18 February comments Brazil avoids that inconvenient definition by simply never mentioning it.18 At the same time, however, Brazil relies heavily on the definition of non-product-specific support
13 For convenience sake, the United States will use the term "product-specific support" as a shorthand for the concept of support to a specific commodity, in contrast to "non-product-specific support".

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-800
in Article 1(a).19 Thus, once again, Brazil invites the Panel to commit legal error in interpreting the phrase "non-product-specific support provided in favour of agricultural producers in general" devoid of the context provided by the immediately preceding definition of product-specific support.
9. That Brazil's position is untenable is demonstrated by comparing Annex 3, entitled "Calculation of Aggregate Measurement of Support," with Article 1(a), which defines "Aggregate Measurement of Support" or "AMS". Paragraph 1 of Annex 3 specifies that two different types of AMS shall be calculated:
· First, "an Aggregate Measurement of Support (AMS) shall be calculated on a product-specific basis for each basic agricultural product." Second, "[s]upport which is non-product specific shall be totalled into one non-product-specific AMS in total monetary terms".
Thus, Annex 3 distinguishes and calls for the separate calculation of non-product-specific support and product-specific support, which together comprise the AMS. Article 1(a), defining AMS, contains the identical distinction. While only non-product-specific support is identified by name, the structure of the AMS definition ­ which parallels Annex 3, paragraph 1 ­ demonstrates that product-specific and non-product-specific support together comprise the AMS:
· "`Aggregate Measurement of Support' and `AMS' mean the annual level of support, expressed in monetary terms, [1] provided for an agricultural product in favour of the producers of the basic agricultural product or [2] non-product-specific support provided in favour of agricultural producers in general . . . [bold and italics added]."20
That is, just as the calculation of AMS (which uses the term "product-specific") distinguishes productspecific from non-product-specific support, logically, so too does the definition of AMS (which does not use that term).21 Thus, it is simply not credible for Brazil to refer to the definition of "nonproduct-specific support" in Article 1(a) but to ignore the immediately preceding definition of product-specific support.22
10. her, Brazil's discussion of the meaning of the term "in general" in the definition of nonproduct-specific support is disappointing because Brazil mischaracterizes the US position and presents the Panel with an interpretation that is not the ordinary meaning of the term. In so doing, Brazil renews a faulty argument advanced in its Peace Clause submissions. In case there were any confusion, the United States clarifies the issue here.
· Brazil has, in fact, never used a dictionary definition of "in general," the exact phrase in the definition of non-product-specific support. Rather, Brazil has attempted to define "in general" by providing definitions of the word "general" as "relating to a whole class of
19 See, e.g., Brazil's 18 February Comments, paras. 9, 12, and 18. 20 Agreement on Agriculture, Article 1(a). 21 See also Agreement on Agriculture, Article 6.4(a) (for purposes of de minimis support, distinguishing "product-specific domestic support" from "non-product-specific domestic support"). 22 See, e.g., Brazil's 18 February Comments, para. 12 ("One interpretive guide to determine whether support is `product-specific' is found in the definition of `non-product-specific support' in Article 1(a) of the Agreement on Agriculture. Brazil demonstrated that only non-product-specific support is actually defined . . . .") (emphasis added).

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-801
objects" and "not partial, local or sectional".23 However, in the same dictionary from which Brazil quotes, there is a definition of "in general," which Brazil continues to avoid.24
· The definition of "in general" that comes closest to Brazil's use (for example, "including, involving, or affecting all or nearly all the parts of a (specified or implied) whole") is "in a body; universally; without exception." However, that definition of "in general" is marked "obsolete" in Brazil's own dictionary.25
· Thus, Brazil errs when it argues that the United States has asserted "that Brazil's definition of `general' is obsolete". Rather, the United States has asserted that Brazil has advanced a reading of the phrase "in general" that employs an obsolete meaning.26
· In contrast, the non-obsolete definition of "in general" is "in general terms, generally".27
Thus, the ordinary meaning of "non-product-specific support provided in favour of agricultural producers in general" in Article 1(a) would be support not "specially . . . pertaining to a particular"28 product provided in favour of agricultural producers "generally".
11. Brazil uses its faulty definition of non-product-specific support to conclude that US decoupled payments are not non-product-specific. However, Brazil recognizes that decoupled income support payments do not require any production29, a recipient may produce nothing at all or may produce any of numerous commodities. Thus, decoupled income support payments are non-productspecific because they do not "specially . . . pertain[] to a particular" product and are support "generally" to producers of whatever commodities they choose to produce (if any).
12. We also pause to note that Brazil argues that the EC, New Zealand, and Argentina believe that decoupled income support in the form of counter-cyclical payments are product-specific.30 However, Brazil points to nothing in the arguments of these third parties that differs from its own flawed interpretation, which the United States has thoroughly rebutted. Moreover, Brazil now explicitly argues that the Peace Clause "may require the application of an allocation methodology for . . . domestic support measures that may provide support to more than one commodity".31
· However, in the Peace Clause phase of this dispute, Brazil had asserted that "[t]he use of the word `specific' [in "support to a specific commodity"] makes clear that AoA [Agreement on Agriculture] Article 13(b)(ii) addresses actionable subsidy challenges made on a

24 See US Rebuttal Submission, para. 83 (22 August 2003). 25 US Comments on Brazil's Rebuttal Submission, para. 23 (noting that the definition of "in general" as "in a body; universally; without exception" was marked "obsolete" in The New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary). 26 US 11 February Comments, para. 10 ("As the United States has pointed out before, not only does this reading of `in general' rely on an obsolete meaning, which therefore cannot be the ordinary meaning of the terms, but Brazil has consistently failed to read together the definitions of product-specific and non-productspecific support in Article 1(a) of the Agreement on Agriculture.") (emphasis added; footnote omitted). 27 "In general" means "in general terms, generally" and "as a rule, usually."

product-by-product basis, as opposed to challenges regarding support for multiple commodities".32
· Further, we recall that the European Communities argued that "support which is provided to a number of crops cannot at the same time be considered `support to a specific commodity'. Such support is `support to several commodities' or `support to more than one commodity'".33
Thus, the European Communities has set out an understanding of "support to a specific commodity" in the Peace Clause that directly contradicts Brazil's current allocation methodology. Had Brazil revealed (or conceived of) its allocation methodology during the Peace Clause phase of the dispute, the third parties would have been in a better position to provide their informed opinions as to Brazil's Peace Clause interpretation and characterization of particular measures.
13. We also note that the context to which Brazil cites in support of its allocation methodology for Peace Clause purposes lends no support to its interpretation. First, Brazil argues that "[f]urther context for the existence of some sort of an allocation methodology in the Agreement on Agriculture is Annex 3, paragraph 7".34 However, even if this provision were to suggest "some sort of an allocation methodology" in the Agreement on Agriculture, it only applies to calculate AMS with respect to measures directed at processors and does not suggest any methodology that would allocate non-product-specific support as "support to a specific commodity." Brazil also suggests that paragraphs 7, 8, 12, and 13 of Annex 3 "include as `product-specific' many types of domestic support not tied to the production of a particular commodity."35 The United States has noted that it is Brazil that has put forward this "tied to the production" definition; the US position is that product-specific support means what Article 1(a) says it does: "support . . . provided for an agricultural product in favour of the producers of the basic agricultural product." That said, none of the paragraphs cited by Brazil speak to an allocation of non-product-specific support as product-specific support. That is, whether measures referred to in those provisions are product-specific or non-product-specific must be determined on the basis of the definition found in Article 1(a).36
14. Finally, Brazil argues that "Article 13(b)(ii) of the Agreement on Agriculture does not provide explicit guidance on how to count up the amount of support for contract or any other types of payments. But this does not mean that no counting methodology can be used. The absence of explicit guidance on implementing more general provisions has not stopped WTO panels or parties from proposing and using methodologies to tabulate the amount of subsidies, costs, and volumes of trade impacted."37 We disagree with Brazil's diagnosis and remedy.
· First, the Peace Clause is not a "general provision[]" lacking "explicit guidance on how to count up the amount of support." In fact, the Peace Clause provides "explicit guidance" through the phrase "support to a specific commodity". Read according to its ordinary meaning and in its context, this phrase refers to product-specific support as defined in
32 Brazil's First Submission, para. 136 (24 June 2003) (emphasis added). 33 Oral Statement by the EC at the First Panel Meeting, para. 21. The same logic would apply to crop insurance payments: support is provided to multiple commodities through premium payments for approved insurance products. See, e.g., US Rebuttal Submission, paras. 93-98 (22 August 2003). 34 Brazil's 18 February Comments, para. 13. 35 Brazil's 18 February Comments, para. 14. 36 For example, Brazil cites to paragraph 8 of Annex 3 on the calculation of "market price support". This provision refers to "the quantity of production eligible to receive the applied administered price"; assuming that "the applied administered price" relates to production of one product, such a measure would be productspecific. Paragraph 12 of Annex 3 refers to "[n]on-exempt direct payments which are based on factors other than price" being measured using budgetary outlays; paragraph 13 refers to the measurement of the value of other non-exempt direct payments; neither provision speaks to the distinction between non-product-specific support and product-specific support nor to the allocation of the former to the latter. 37 Brazil's 18 February Comments, para. 34.

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-803
Article 1(a) of the Agreement on Agriculture. The definitions in Article 1(a) establish a methodology by which product-specific support is included in "count[ing] up the amount of support" for Peace Clause purposes while non-product-specific is not.
· Second, given the balance struck in concluding the Uruguay Round between the need to achieve binding reduction commitments on agricultural support and the need of Members to be able to design measures to conform to those commitments ­ a point to which we return later ­ it is difficult to imagine that Members would have left the issue of how to calculate the "support to a specific commodity" for Peace Clause purposes undefined, putting the Panel in the difficult position of "proposing and using [a] methodolog[y]" on such a crucial issue. In fact, the Peace Clause provides a methodology for calculating that support. The measures to be included in the calculation are identified by the phrase "support to a specific commodity," as explained in the preceding bullet. The unit of measure to be used in the Peace Clause comparison is identified by the way in which the Member "decided" support during the 1992 marketing year.38
Thus, Members did not put the Panel in the untenable position of "adopt[ing] a reasonable methodology" with respect to its Peace Clause findings. Rather, they agreed to language that provides an explicit methodology both for the Panel's purposes as well as for the purposes of Members who wished to ensure their measures would conform to the Peace Clause. Neither Brazil's allocation "methodology [n]or some variant of its methodology" ­ however "reasonable" Brazil may believe those to be ­ can serve those purposes or find any basis in the Peace Clause and the Agreement on Agriculture.
15. Thus, we end where we began: the interpretation of the Peace Clause phrase "support to a specific commodity" we have provided is based on its ordinary meaning and in light of the context provided by relevant provisions of the Agreement on Agriculture,39 in particular, the definition of product-specific support in Article 1(a). Brazil, on the other hand, does not read this phrase according to the ordinary meaning of all of its terms, ignores the context provided by those provisions of the Agreement on Agriculture that use the terms "support", "specific," and "commodity," ignores the definition of product-specific support in Article 1(a), and instead points to provisions that do not provide any relevant context.
16. The Panel may ask itself: can a methodology that (as Brazil's tortured allocation methodology would have it) results in a payment sometimes being considered as support to no commodity (if the recipient produces nothing), sometimes as support to one commodity (if the recipient has planted a number of acres of a crop at least equal to the number of recipient's base acres of that crop), or sometimes as support to multiple commodities (if the recipient plants fewer acres of any crop for which the recipient has base acres) provide any meaningful interpretation of the phrase "support to a specific commodity"? The United States believes that the answer is no. Brazil has, at best, appreciated the reality of the payments in question: they are paid to producers in any of the situations it has described. Such support is not "support to a specific commodity" under the ordinary meaning of the terms (assistance or backing specially pertaining to a particular agricultural crop) or the Article 1(a) definition (support provided for an agricultural product in favour of the producers of the basic agricultural products). Rather, it is non-product specific support (support not specially pertaining to a particular product provided in favour of agricultural producers generally).
38 Thus, in the case of the United States, the support "decided during the 1992 marketing year" was a rate of support provided by the target price for deficiency payments of 72.9 cents per pound and the marketing loan rate of 52.35 cents per pound. See US February 11 Comments, paras. 15-17.
39 See, e.g., Agreement on Agriculture, Articles 1(a), 1(d), 1(f), 6.4, and Annex 3 (paragraphs 1 and 7).

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-804
Brazil's Costs of Production Approach to Determine Whether Payments are "Support to a Specific Commodity" Does Not Withstand Scrutiny
17. In the foregoing section, the United States set out the textual and contextual basis for reading the Peace Clause phrase "support to a specific commodity" according to the definition of productspecific support in Article 1(a). We also pointed out that it is not the United States that has attempted to apply Subsidies Agreement concepts to the Peace Clause analysis as Brazil incorrectly asserted. Rather, it is Brazil that has attempted to apply an (incorrect) allocation methodology as might be relevant for purposes of actionable subsidies claims under the Subsidies Agreement to the Peace Clause analysis. In so doing, Brazil has asserted a principle for determining whether a subsidy provides support to a commodity ­ that is, whether "they cover (or contribute to) the costs of production of a crop"40 ­ that is unworkable and illogical.
18. First, we note that Brazil defines "support" as relating to the recipient, but later elides this into support for a crop. For example, Brazil writes: "[T]he word `support' has a more general sense of `backing up' a group of agricultural farmers producing a specific commodity. For example, subsidies that cover costs of production when a farmer chooses to grow a crop, `back up' or `support' that farmer".41 However, the Peace Clause text is "support to a specific commodity" not support to farmers producing a specific commodity. This distinction is also found in the Article 1(a) definition of product-specific support: "support . . . provided for an agricultural product in favour of the producers of the basic agricultural product". The difference is that income support provided to farmers is not "support to a specific commodity" because the support is not "provided for an agricultural product" over any other; the farmer can (in Brazil's words), "choose[] to grow a crop", choose to grow no crop, or choose to grow multiple crops. Even if all recipients of a decoupled payment chose to produce one crop in particular, the payment would still not be support "for an agricultural product"; the support is "for" no specific product but rather is support not "specially . . . pertaining to a particular" product that supports producers generally. It is those producers, in turn, who may choose to produce one crop in particular.
19. Brazil then, without further explanation, links the notion that support has a "sense" of backing up a farmer who "chooses to grow a crop" to the notion that such support is "support to a specific commodity" by asserting that "all of these subsidies at issue in this dispute `support' production of upland cotton because they cover (or contribute to) the costs of production of a crop".42 Brazil nowhere provides any basis in the text of the Peace Clause or the Agreement on Agriculture for this test. Neither does Brazil explain the necessary implications of its approach.
20. For example, if a decoupled payment is "support to a specific commodity" if it "cover[s] (or contribute[s] to) the costs of production of a crop" then the same payment will be product-specific for some producers but not others. Brazil has pointed to survey data from 1997 ­ that the United States has explained is technologically and structurally out-of date43 ­ for the notion that average total costs of production for US producers are $0.73 per pound. On this basis, Brazil has (incorrectly) claimed that decoupled payments were necessary to cover the gap between market revenue and costs. Putting aside the extensive US critique of Brazil's argument (such as its reliance on total costs instead of operating costs)44, however, the out-of-date per pound total average cost on which Brazil relies is just
40 Brazil's 18 February Comments, para. 3. 41 Brazil's 18 February Comments, para. 3 (italics added). 42 Brazil's 18 February Comments, para. 3. 43 US Further Rebuttal Submission, paras. 123-33. 44 The United States has presented a detailed critique of Brazil's alleged costs of production vs. total revenue "gap" in paragraphs 105-41 of its further rebuttal submission of 18 November 2003. As further confirmation that Brazil's "average total costs of production" argument is wrong, we note that Brazil silently has de-emphasized its assertion that, to cover their high costs of production, upland cotton producers must have planted upland cotton "on" upland cotton, rice, or peanut base acreage to reap decoupled payments for these

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-805
that, an average. In claiming that all decoupled payments received by upland cotton producers (satisfying its complicated allocation methodology) are support to upland cotton, Brazil takes no account of the distribution of costs across farms. That is, some farms produce at costs below the average and some produce at costs above the average.45 Brazil attempts no analysis of whether decoupled payments received by producers who produce cotton at costs below the average "cover (or contribute to) the costs of production of" upland cotton.
· However, under Brazil's own rationale, if the decoupled payments do not "cover (or contribute to) the costs of production of a crop", then those payments do not support production of that crop and are not support to a specific commodity.
Thus, those payments could not form part of Brazil's Peace Clause analysis, but Brazil has not accounted for this.
21. Consider further Brazil's argument that "[w]ithout direct and counter-cyclical payments in MY 2002, the average US cotton farmer would have lost 14.36 cents per pound. With these two payments, they earned a `profit' of 4.2 cents per pound with the cotton DP and CCP payments".46 But Brazil has asserted that payments are "support to a specific commodity" only if they "cover (or contribute to) the costs of production of a crop".
· Thus, under Brazil's own rationale, the 4.2 cents per pound of "profit" ­ that is, returns above and beyond total costs of production ­ that Brazil attributes to decoupled payments cannot be "support to" upland cotton.
Brazil, of course, fails to carry through its rationale to this extent because this would reduce the decoupled payments it has calculated as support to upland cotton under its own (incorrect) approach.
22. In addition, Brazil's argument that payments are "support to a specific commodity" only if they "cover (or contribute to) the costs of production of a crop" carried through to its logical end would not only run contrary to the definitions of product-specific support and non-product-specific support in Article 1(a) of the Agreement on Agriculture but would produce illogical results. Consider the situation of marketing loan payments for soybeans:
· In the US view, there is no question that these payments are "support to a specific commodity" within the meaning of the Peace Clause because they are "support . . . provided for an agricultural product in favour of the producers of the basic agricultural product" (Article 1(a)).
base acres. See, e.g., Brazil's Closing Statement at the Second Session of the First Panel Meeting, Annex I (summary of evidence demonstrating that upland cotton producers in MY 1999-2002 produced upland cotton on upland cotton, rice, or peanut base acreage) (October 9, 2003). In fact, without having repudiated its earlier argument, Brazil's 28 January calculations demonstrate that Brazil's allocation methodology results in payments for many other programme crops being allocated to cotton. For example, for farms producing cotton and having cotton base, in marketing year 1999, payments for wheat, oats, rice, corn, and sorghum are allocated to cotton; in marketing year 2000, payments for wheat, rice, corn, sorghum, and barley are allocated to cotton; and in marketing year 2001, payments for wheat, rice, corn, and barley are allocated to cotton, oats, and sorghum. Brazil's 18 February Comments, Annex A, paras. 15-19 (Tables 2.5-2.8). That is, under Brazil's 20 January allocation methodology, upland cotton is allegedly "planted on" base acres for each of the programme crops just listed, not the cotton, rice, or peanut acres in Brazil's costs argument. Brazil has never explained the contradiction in its two arguments.
45 For example, the 1997 study shows that in that year the 25 per cent of US cotton farms with the lowest cost (accounting for 36 per cent of cotton production) had average operating costs of $0.31 cents per pound and average total costs of $0.55 cents per pound. Exhibit BRA-16, at tbl. 2.

· Under Brazil's rationale, however, marketing loan payments for soybeans might not be "support to" soybeans because they might not "cover (or contribute to) the costs of production of [that] crop".
· To determine whether, under Brazil's theory, those marketing loan payments for soybeans are "support to" soybeans or "support to" some other commodity (such as upland cotton) "requires an examination of the record evidence concerning the extent to which the payments de facto support or maintain the production of a specific commodity".47
· Under some combination of facts, then, marketing loan payments for soybeans could be deemed, under Brazil's theory, to be support to upland cotton (or some other commodity).
This cannot be the right result since, if the marketing loan payments provide any incentive to production (which will depend on the expected harvest season prices at planting), they provide an incentive to plant soybeans, not upland cotton (and if payments are made, they are made to producers of soybeans, not upland cotton). A correct reading of the Peace Clause does produce the right result since such payments are "support to a specific commodity," soybeans48, regardless of "the record evidence concerning the extent to which the payments de facto support or maintain the production of a specific commodity".
23. Finally, as a factual matter, we would note that Brazil has not addressed the most telling data that contradicts its assertion that decoupled payments "directly maintain the production of" upland cotton. This is the significant amount of upland cotton acreage planted by farms without any upland cotton base acres.
· Under the 1996 Act, farms without any upland cotton base acres planted 1.0 million acres of upland cotton in marketing year 1999, 1.2 million acres of upland cotton in marketing year 2000, 1.3 million acres in marketing year 2001, and 1.5 million acres in marketing year 2002.49
· After new base acreages were established in the 2002 Act (for purposes of direct and countercyclical payments), farms without any upland cotton base acres planted 0.5 million acres of upland cotton in marketing year 2002.
Under Brazil's theory, none of these acres should have been planted since without decoupled payments for upland cotton base acres, these producers "would have lost $332.79 per acre between MY 1997-2002" and "would have lost 14.36 cents per pound" in marketing year 2002.50 The fact that such large numbers of acres were planted without decoupled payments for upland cotton base acres demonstrates that, as a factual matter, US upland cotton producers can and do plant upland cotton without the allegedly indispensable decoupled payments for upland cotton base acres.51
47 Brazil's 18 February Comments, para. 22; see also id., para. 32 ("In sum, the proper allocation methodology under Article 13(b)(ii) of the Agreement on Agriculture must be consistent with the extent to which the domestic support payments directly maintain the production of a specific commodity.").
48 Under Article 1(a), marketing loan payments for soybeans are "support . . . provided for an agricultural product [soybeans] in favour of the producers of the basic agricultural product". Under the ordinary meaning of the terms "support to a specific commodity," marketing loan payments for soybeans are "assistance" or "backing" "specially . . . pertaining to a particular" "agricultural product": soybeans.

24. Thus, the principle Brazil advances to determine whether and to what extent decoupled payments are support to a specific commodity ­ that is, whether they "cover (or contribute to) the costs of production of a crop" ­ must fail. This principle is not applied by Brazil to its logical ends because to do so would reduce the amount of support to upland cotton Brazil has calculated to upland cotton. Most importantly, Brazil's costs of production principle finds no support in the text of the Peace Clause or any WTO agreement (such as the definition of product-specific support in Article 1(a)). Thus, the Panel should reject Brazil's erroneous approach.
Brazil's Argument that Decoupled Income Support Payments Are De Facto Tied to Production Is Wrong
25. Brazil argues that the decoupled income support measures at issue in this dispute cannot be allocated across "the total value of the recipient firm's sales" under paragraph 2 of Subsidies Agreement Annex IV because the payments are "de facto tied to upland cotton production".52 Brazil also argues that the amount of subsidies that support upland cotton cannot be determined under Annex IV, paragraph 3, and therefore "Annex IV does not assist the Panel in determining the amount of support to upland cotton, within the meaning of Article 13(b)(ii) of the Agreement on Agriculture".53 On this latter point, we are in agreement with Brazil: as set out above, the Peace Clause establishes the relevant support through the ordinary meaning of the phrase "support to a specific commodity" in its context, not by way of Annex IV. Under a correct reading of the phrase "support to a specific commodity", no allocation methodology may be applied to allocate nonproduct-specific support as "support to a specific commodity". Here, however, we note that Brazil's argument relating to the alleged de facto tie of payments to production does not hold.
26. In fact, the evidence does not support Brazil's argument that decoupled income support payments are "tied to the production or sale of a given product".54 These payments are received by recipients that may choose to produce no, one, or many different products. The evidence presented by the United States ­ fully consistent with the Environmental Working Group data presented by Brazil55 ­ is that approximately 47 per cent of upland cotton farms eligible for decoupled income support payments planted no cotton in marketing year 2002.56 Thus, payments are not "tied to the production or sale of a given product" since nearly half of the recipients do not plant even a single acre of cotton.
upland cotton and had, in the aggregate, 5.4 million base acres of upland cotton; the 7,420 farms in category C planted 0.5 million acres of upland cotton and had 0 base acres of upland cotton. In marketing year 2001, the 61,854 farms in category B planted 10.0 million acres of upland cotton and had 6.4 million base acres of upland cotton; the 20,322 farms in category C planted 1.3 million acres of upland cotton and had no upland cotton base acres. In marketing year 2000, the 62,557 farms in category B planted 9.8 million acres of upland cotton and had 6.4 million base acres of upland cotton; the 18,001 farms in category C planted 1.2 million acres of upland cotton and had no upland cotton base acres. In marketing year 1999, the 59,793 farms in category B planted 9.0 million acres of upland cotton and had 6.0 million base acres of upland cotton; the 15,812 farms in category C planted 1.0 million acres of upland cotton and had no upland cotton base acres. Under Brazil's theory, none of the tens of thousands of category B farms should have planted more upland cotton acres than their respective quantities of upland cotton base acres, and none of the tens of thousands of category C farms should have planted upland cotton at all.

27. Brazil points to evidence that it asserts demonstrates the "crucial role that each of the four contract payments plays in maintaining the production of US upland cotton".57 That is, Brazil argues that without the decoupled income support payments, many US producers would not have been able to continue producing cotton. However, Brazil's argument is not, as in Annex IV, that "the subsidy is tied to the production or sale of a given product", but rather that the production or sale of a given product is tied to the subsidy. The two statements are not equivalent. That an upland cotton farmer could not produce upland cotton without a subsidy payment (an argument which the United States has rebutted) does not mean that the payment is "tied to the production or sale of a given product" if recipients may produce or sell other than a given product. This is precisely the case with respect to decoupled income support payments: there is no "tie" to the production or sale of upland cotton because payment recipients can choose not to produce upland cotton (or any other crop).
28. Thus, Brazil has not established that the decoupled income support payments are "de facto tied to upland cotton production"; rather, the facts that demonstrate that nearly half of the payment recipients choose not to plant upland cotton at all de facto contradict Brazil's argument.
Brazil Has Not Made a Prima Facie Case under its Subsidies Claims with respect to Decoupled Payments
29. The United States has previously explained that Brazil has not properly interpreted the Peace Clause proviso and has not demonstrated that the challenged US measures are in breach of the Peace Clause. This ends the analysis with respect to Brazil's subsidies claims under Subsidies Agreement Articles 5 and 6 and GATT 1994 Article XVI:1. However, even if the Panel were to look beyond the Peace Clause to Brazil's subsidies claims, Brazil has not established a prima facie case with respect to decoupled payments.58
30. Brazil now argues that, while "Part III of the Subsidies Agreement does not require detailing the precise amount of the subsidies", Brazil "has presented evidence and argument, in the alternative, regarding the size and subsidization rate of the subsidies challenged."59 Brazil further claims that it "has offered the contract payment quantities (as well as the other subsidies) established in the peace clause phase of the proceedings as the `amount of subsidization', to the extent this is required, in the serious prejudice phase". In light of Brazil's repeated disavowals of any need to identify the amount of the subsidy for purposes of its subsidies claims,60 the United States does not believe that this and two other comments referenced by Brazil demonstrate that Brazil has argued and advanced evidence relating to identification of the challenged subsidy.61
57 Brazil's 18 February Comments, para. 32. 58 The United States has elsewhere explained that Brazil has not demonstrated serious prejudice, or threat thereof, from upland cotton marketing loan payments or any other challenged US measures. See, e.g., US Further Rebuttal Submission, paras. 1-177; US Further Submission, paras. 16-133. 59 Brazil's 18 February Comments, para. 78. The United States continues to be surprised by Brazil's denial of the significance of the amount of the subsidy for purposes of determining "the effect of the subsidy' under its serious prejudice claims. For example, had the DSB initiated the Annex V information-gathering process, that process would have been concerned, in part, with establishing "the amount of subsidization," Subsidies Agreement, Annex V, para. 2, and "the amount of the subsidy in question," id., Annex V, para. 7. Brazil's position that "the effect of the subsidy" may be evaluated without identifying the amount of the subsidy is akin to saying that one can determine "the effect of eating" without knowing how much is being eaten. 60 See, e.g., US 11 February comments, para. 24. 61 See Brazil's Comment on US Answer to Question 214 from the Panel, para. 216 (28 January 2003) ("Detailing the precise amount of the financial contribution ending up in the bank accounts of US upland cotton producers is not a legal pre-requisite to Brazil's actionable subsidy claims. If the Panel finds that Brazil is legally required to examine the exact amount of the subsidies in order to assess their `effects,' . . . Brazil refers the Panel to evidence and the allocation of the amount of `support to upland cotton' it has presented in the peace clause portion of its various submissions. This evidence is part of the record pursuant to Brazil's alternative arguments and is offered as evidence of the amount of such subsidy payments."); Brazil's Opening Statement at

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-809
31. Nonetheless, even if the Panel were to find that Brazil's comments dated 28 January 2004, and 11 February 2004 ­ that is, more than eight months into this dispute and after scheduled panel meetings and written submissions have been concluded62 ­ advanced an argument in the alternative, Brazil still would not have made a prima facie case with respect to decoupled payments. As set out in the US 11 February comments63, Brazil has never presented evidence nor made arguments that would allow the Panel to evaluate "the effect of the subsidy [decoupled income support payments]". In particular, Brazil has never presented information relating to the total value of the recipients' sales as would be necessary to determine the amount of these subsidies benefiting upland cotton that are not tied to the production or sale of a given product. The reason for this omission is simple: Brazil has never believed, nor does it today, that the Annex IV methodology is necessary or even relevant to identify the subsidy benefit and subsidized product.64 Because Brazil believes Annex IV is irrelevant for the Peace Clause but has offered its Peace Clause calculations (again, in the alternative) "as evidence of the amount of such subsidy payments"65, logically, Brazil must believe that Annex IV "does not assist the Panel in determining the amount of [the subsidy]".66
32. We do note that Brazil has argued that, "as an alternative argument, Brazil attempted in its 28 January 2004 Comments to apply the Annex IV paragraph 2 non-tied subsidy allocation methodology to the US summary data".67 We later set out in more detail the infirmities in Brazil's calculations. Here, we note that, Brazil evidently believes that by liberally assigning the "in the alternative" label, it will be able to assert that it has advanced evidence and arguments relating to whatever methodology the Panel adopts. Such an approach speaks volumes to Brazil's confidence in its approach to its serious prejudice claims, but it is also not enough to meet its prima facie case. A party may not make an argument, even if "in the alternative", for the first time nine months into briefing in a dispute, in its 18 February "Comments on US 11 February Comments on Brazil's 28 January `Comments and Requests Regarding Data Provided by the United States on 18/19 December 2003 and the US Refusal to Provide Non-Scrambled Data on 20 January 2004", in order to later claim to have carried its burden of making a prima facie case should the Panel decide to rely on this new argument. (The Panel will appreciate the irony that the party that has been complaining incessantly about delay in the proceedings has now been reduced to improperly trying to take advantage of that delay.) To allow this would deny the United States due process ­ as the entire dispute has been argued on other grounds and enormous amounts of time and resources have been
the Second Panel Meeting, para. 5 ("In any event, Brazil has demonstrated a collective subsidization rate averaging 95 per cent and subsidies in the amount of $12.9 billion.").
62 Article 12 and Appendix 3 of the DSU contemplates a process which all WTO dispute settlement proceedings must follow in order to ensure due process for the parties involved. Such a process requires that the parties "present the facts of the case, their arguments and their counter-arguments" before the first substantive meeting of the panel (see para. 4 of the Working Procedures of the Panel), present their case at the first substantive meeting of the panel (see para. 5 of the Working Procedures of the Panel), and then present their formal rebuttals by the second substantive meeting of the panel (see para. 6 of the Working Procedures of the Panel). In this regard, for Brazil to present new arguments for the first time now, or to use recently submitted US data to try to meet Brazil's initial burden of proof now, outside of the confines of the established panel process and without allowing the United States to provide counter-arguments or rebuttals, would appear contrary to the due process safeguards provided by the DSU and the Working Procedures of the Panel.

devoted to defending against the arguments Brazil did make ­ and deprive the Panel of the opportunity to receive fully considered briefing with respect to those issues.
33. Finally, through its belated and patently inadequate arguments and evidence relating to Annex IV, Brazil has put the Panel in the inappropriate position of "mak[ing] the case for the complaining party" were it to base any serious prejudice findings on decoupled payment subsidies allocated using the Annex IV methodology. As we stated in the February 11 comments:
· "Brazil has neither sought nor presented any evidence relating to the total value of the recipient firms' sales. Brazil has also not only not argued that the Annex IV methodology is necessary to identify the subsidized product and the subsidy benefit, Brazil has also continually argued against use of the Annex IV methodology since, in its view, no allocation of the payment or quantification of the benefit is warranted under Part III of the Subsidies Agreement. Thus, it would appear that Brazil has resisted making the necessary legal arguments and refused to submit any evidence relating a proper analysis of its claims."68
Brazil chose to challenge decoupled income support payments not tied to production or sale of a given product but also chose not to seek, develop, and present evidence relating to the total value of the recipients' sales. In fact, Brazil has not presented evidence that would allow that methodology to be applied.69 Therefore, due to its own litigation choices, Brazil has not established the amount of the challenged subsidies and therefore has not established a prima facie case that the effect of decoupled income support payments is to cause serious prejudice to Brazil's interests. The United States respectfully requests the Panel to so find.
34. The United States has reviewed Brazil's new comments regarding the Japan ­ Agricultural Products Appellate Body report and believes that Brazil continues to misread that report. In fact, Brazil does not address any of the facts relating to the "claims" and "arguments" made by the United States in that dispute, instead relying on generalizations as to "the proposition" that that report "stands for".70 The United States refers the Panel to its previous comments on this report for a more complete analysis.71
35. The United States does note that Brazil argues that any evidence sought by the Panel that would allow an Annex IV calculation to be made "was entirely consistent" with the US proposal of that methodology and Brazil's in the alternative argument. We have already shown that Brazil's "in the alternative" evidence and arguments are patently insufficient, and this was done without the need for additional information or the need to run any Annex IV calculations. Further, it requires no information to understand and evaluate the US rebuttal that Brazil had not brought forward evidence and arguments relating to the Annex IV methodology necessary for Brazil to identify the subsidy benefit and subsidized product. In other words, Brazil cannot use a US defence as rationale to insist that the Panel seek information and make all the Annex IV calculations necessary to make Brazil's prima facie case for Brazil.
Brazil's Various Allocation Methodologies, In Addition to Being Irrelevant for Peace Clause Purposes and Inapplicable for Serious Prejudice Claims, Are Internally Inconsistent and Illogical
36. The United States here addresses Brazil's revised, and in some cases new, allocation methodologies. Brazil advances all of these allocation calculations for purposes of the Peace Clause (and, in the alternative, to identify the amount of the challenged subsidies). For purposes of the Peace
68 US 11 February Comments, para. 33. 69 See US 11 February Comments, paras. 44-60. 70 Brazil's 18 February Comments, para. 88. 71 US 11 February Comments, paras. 31-34.

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-811
Clause, as set out above, the United States believes that no allocation methodology may be employed since the only relevant support is product-specific. For purposes of Brazil's serious prejudice claims, we have already explained that the Annex IV methodology would be necessary to identify the subsidy benefit and subsidized product for each of the challenged decoupled income support measures ­ and Brazil has not brought forward evidence and arguments to allow the Annex IV methodology to be used. Nonetheless, here we present certain additional comments on Brazil's allocation methodologies.
Brazil's Allocation Methodology Is Internally Inconsistent and Not Applied Consistently
37. In its February 18 comments, Brazil reaffirms that "its methodology allocates support paid for upland cotton base that is `planted to' upland cotton. It further allocates proportionally any other contract crop base payments that are not allocated to plantings of the respective contract payments crop".72 We note that Brazil inserted quotation marks around "planted to" in the phrase "upland cotton base that is `planted to' upland cotton". The reason for this is, as the United States has explained, there are no physical "base acres" on a farm. Crop base acres are an accounting fiction that do not represent any particular acres on the farm.73 Thus, base acres cannot be physically "planted to" any crop; this expression merely means that a quantity of acres has been planted that corresponds to (are equal to or less than) a farm's quantity of base acres. Thus, at the outset, there is no physical basis to say that decoupled payments for base acres of a crop must be "support to" that crop to the extent that the quantity of planted acres is less than or equal to the quantity of base acres ­ but that is exactly the first step in Brazil's flawed methodology.74
38. There is also no economic basis to conclude that (in Brazil's words) payments for base acres of a crop "planted to" that crop are support to that planted crop. Because a recipient of a decoupled income support payment is free to plant no crop, plant one crop, plant multiple crops, or engage in other economic activities, that payment is a subsidy to all of the recipient's economic activities (if any). Brazil's "planted to" approach does not take into account the fungible nature of money: if the payment recipient chooses to produce only upland cotton, that would be the sole "subsidized product", but if the recipient chooses to produce upland cotton and other products, all of those products are the "subsidized product" since the payment could have been applied to any of those activities. (In fact, recipients of decoupled payments do engage in a myriad of other activities; for example, in marketing year 2002, the 137,160 cotton farms falling in Category A as defined by the Panel (that is, that planted fewer cotton acres than their quantities of upland cotton base acres) planted over 1 million acres of fruits and vegetables and nearly 7 million acres of "other crops" as compared to nearly 6 million acres of upland cotton.)75
39. Further, we note that Brazil's reason for treating decoupled income support payments for upland cotton base acres as "support to" upland cotton was allegedly based on the de facto tie between such payments and upland cotton production. That is, Brazil argued that such payments were necessary to support or maintain upland cotton production.76 But Brazil does not apply that analysis throughout its methodology.
72 Brazil's 18 February Comments, para. 57. 73 US 11 February Comments, para. 38. 74 Applied to decoupled payments for upland cotton base acres, this first step in Brazil's methodology is the "cotton-to-cotton" alternative methodology set out by Brazil. See, e.g., Brazil's 18 February Comments, Annex A, para. 3 ("Under this approach, only upland cotton payments for upland cotton base acres that are actually planted to upland cotton would be considered support to upland cotton.") (italics added). As set out in the text above, base acres are not "actually planted to" anything; thus, in addition to not accounting for the fungible nature of money, the cotton-to-cotton methodology is not based on any physical reality. 75 See file "DCP02-2W.xls" (Category A farms, "Total" row). 76 See, e.g., Brazil's 18 February Comments, paras. 22-28.

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-812
· Brazil also allocates decoupled income support payments for non-upland cotton base acres first to the respective programme crops.77
· However, Brazil has made no analysis of whether such decoupled payments for non-upland cotton base acres support or maintain the production of the respective programme crop to which they are allocated by Brazil.
Therefore, even under its own Peace Clause analysis, Brazil has provided no basis to a key step in its allocation methodology ­ that is, the allocation of payments for non-upland cotton base acres first to the respective programme crops.
40. Brazil's current Peace Clause allocation methodology also directly contradicts its position earlier in this dispute. First, Brazil argued that all payments for upland cotton base acres were support to upland cotton. Then, Brazil amended its argument and asserted that, in order to cover their total costs, upland cotton producers must have planted upland cotton "on" upland cotton base acres. Subsequently, Brazil changed that argument to upland cotton must be "planted on" base acres for upland cotton, rice, or peanuts.78 Thus, the latter two of these arguments were predicated on the notion that each planted acre of upland cotton corresponded to one base acre. Now, however, Brazil's allocation methodology could assign payments from multiple base acres to a single planted acre of upland cotton.79
41. Tellingly, Brazil has no response to this critique of its methodology, other than to assert that "they affect, at most, 0.9 per cent of the payments at issue for MY 2002"80 and a vague statement that "[a]s for some of the US criticisms that might affect the results (except for MY2002), Brazil will control for these effects once the United States provides aggregate data in the manner requested by the Panel".81
· That is, Brazil has no logical explanation for the internal inconsistency in its methodology, that one upland cotton base acre should be allocated to one upland cotton planted acre while multiple non-upland cotton base acres could be allocated to one upland cotton planted acre.
This internal inconsistency suggests that Brazil's methodology is an effort to assign the maximum amount of payments to upland cotton, regardless of whether it provides any economically neutral method to allocate decoupled payments (as Annex IV, paragraph 2, does).
42. As the United States has previously pointed out, moreover, there is no economic reason to attribute decoupled income support payments to some crops (programme crops) but not others and some economic activities (programme crop production) but not others.82 Brazil's 18 February calculations demonstrate the point. For farms with no upland cotton base acres, Brazil treats all upland cotton planted acres as "overplanted base" (that is, planted acres in excess of base acres)
77 See, e.g., Brazil's February 18 Comments, Annex A, Tables 2.5-2.7; id., Annex A, para. 15 n. 175 ("The subsidy allocated is the entire amount of contract payments for that crop if planted acreage exceeds or equals base acreage. The subsidy allocated is [the] amount of contract payments for that crop adjusted by the ratio of planted acreage to base acreage if planted acreage is below base acreage.").
78 See, e.g., Brazil's Closing Statement at the Second Session of the First Panel Meeting, Annex I (summary of evidence demonstrating that upland cotton producers in MY 1999-2002 produced upland cotton on upland cotton, rice, or peanut base acreage) (9 October 2003).
79 See US 11 February Comments, para. 38 (providing example of farm with 100 base acres of soy, 10 planted acres of soy, and 1 planted acre of cotton; under Brazil's methodology, the 1 acre of cotton would be "planted on" (receive payments related to) 90 base acres of soy).
80 Brazil's 18 February Comments, para. 60. 81 Brazil's 18 February Comments, para. 67. 82 See US 11 February Comments, para. 37.

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-813
eligible for an allocation of the total subsidies available from "excess" base acres for other programme crops.83
· However, non-programme crops are in the identical position to upland cotton: that is, all nonprogramme crops also have base acreage equal to zero.84
· Even on Brazil's methodology, there is no reason (other than Brazil's assertion that it is so) to treat decoupled payments for non-upland cotton base acres as subsidizing upland cotton when a farm has overplanted its (zero) upland cotton base but not to non-programme crops that also (necessarily) have "overplanted" their base.
43. Finally, we note that, had Brazil desired to make its invented allocation methodology consistent with other arguments in its 18 February comments, it should have allocated "excess" base acres not to programme crops with "overplanted base" but rather to any crop (programme or not) produced by a payment recipient for which such payments "cover (or contribute to) the costs of production".85 Where payments "cover (or contribute to) the costs of production," according to Brazil, payments must be "support to [that] specific commodity."86 Further, if Brazil has not analyzed whether the challenged payments "cover (or contribute to) the costs of production" of other products produced by payment recipients, Brazil cannot assert that any payments must be "support to" one commodity over another since the payment might be necessary to "cover (or contribute to) the costs of production" of more than one product. That Brazil was unwilling to apply its "costs of production" principle throughout its allocation methodology suggests that Brazil's approach to Peace Clause interpretation has been a post hoc exercise in rationalization.
44. In sum, Brazil's allocation methodology is irrelevant to the Peace Clause because the only relevant support is product-specific. Unlike the Annex IV methodology, moreover, it is not a neutral and economically rational methodology for allocating a non-tied subsidy (such as decoupled payments) in order to identify the subsidized product and the amount of the subsidy. Finally, it is internally inconsistent and even contradicts other arguments Brazil has put forward in this dispute, for example, its argument that a payment is "support to a specific commodity" if it "cover[s] (or contribute[s] to) the costs of production" of that commodity.
Brazil's "Annex IV" Methodologies Are Nothing Like the Methodology Set Out in Annex IV
45. Brazil presents two other methodologies, a "modified Annex IV" calculation and a "US Annex IV calculation". Neither of these methodologies could serve as a basis to identify the amount of subsidy and subsidized product for purposes of Brazil's serious prejudice claims. The correct methodology is neither a "modified" nor a "US" methodology; rather, it is the methodology set out in the text of Annex IV. That text establishes that, if a payment is not "tied to the production or sale of a given product," the subsidized product is all of the recipient firm's sales, and the subsidy for any one product is that product's share of "the total value of the recipient firm's sales".87 Brazil does not use
83 See, e.g., Brazil's 18 February Comments, Tables 2.17 & 2.18 (upland cotton base acres: 0; upland cotton planted acres: 518,837.0; planted acres over which "excess" subsidy allocated: 518,837.0).
84 The data submitted in response to the Panel's supplementary request for information reveals that in marketing year 2002 (after base acres were established under the 2002 Act) farms planting upland cotton and having no upland cotton base acres planted substantial amounts of non-programme crop acreage, for example, 64,917 acres of fruits and vegetables, 9,664 acres of tobacco, and 169,480 acres of other crops. See "DCP022W.xls" file, Category C farms, "Total" row.
85 Brazil's 18 February Comments, para. 3. 86 Recall that it is for purposes of the Peace Clause that Brazil asserts its allocation methodology; in the alternative, Brazil argues that its Peace Clause methodology would also calculate the amount of the subsidy for its serious prejudice claims. 87 Subsidies Agreement, Annex IV, paras. 2-3.

"the total value of the recipient firm's sales" in its "Annex IV calculations" and does not even attempt to calculate total sales of upland cotton producers. Thus, neither of these methodologies can fairly be called an "Annex IV" calculation.
46. With respect to Brazil's "modified Annex IV" methodology, we note that Brazil allocated total contract payments to farms producing upland cotton "over the value of contract payment crops produced on the farms" based on the assumption that "contract payments are support only to contract payment crops".88 This approach is fundamentally inconsistent with Annex IV, paragraph 2, under which the subsidy is allocated over "the total value of the recipient firm's sales." Further, the United States has set out above a rebuttal of Brazil's assertion that decoupled income support payments could be considered "support only to contract payment crops". For example, such an approach ignores the fungible nature of money and contradicts Brazil's argument that payments are support to those crops whose costs are covered by the payments.
47. With respect to Brazil's "US Annex IV methodology," the United States has explained above that Brazil has not made a prima facie case with respect to decoupled payments because it has not presented evidence and arguments sufficient to allow an Annex IV calculation to be made. Brazil also has not corrected for errors in its calculations that the United States previously pointed out in its 11 February comments.
48. For example, Brazil's "US Annex IV methodology" errs in omitting the value of fruits and vegetables in calculating the total value of non-programme crop production. Brazil justifies this stance by asserting that fruits and vegetables could not possibly be "beneficiaries" of decoupled payments because they may not be grown on base acres. Again, this argument by Brazil ignores Annex IV, paragraph 2, under which the subsidy is allocated over "the total value of the recipient firm's sales" and ignores the non-tied (decoupled) nature of these payments. The aggregate data submitted today demonstrates that, in marketing year 2002 alone, 1.2 million acres were planted to fruits and vegetables on farms that reported cotton base acreage.89 As pointed out in the US comments of 11 February90, excluding fruits and vegetables biases significantly downward the value of non-programme crop acreage. For example, the per-acre value of non-programme crops including fruits and vegetables was estimated at $28191 for 2002 ­ that is, 138 per cent higher than the $118 per acre Brazil calculated when fruits and vegetables are excluded.92
49. Including fruits and vegetables in the total value of crop production gives a more accurate reflection of the share of upland cotton as a per cent of the total value of crop production on farms that planted upland cotton. As noted previously,93 had Brazil included fruits and vegetables in the value of non-programme crop cropland, upland cotton would have accounted for approximately 48.4 per cent to 56.7 per cent of the total value of crop production on farms that planted cotton in 1999-2002.
50. Moreover, Brazil has not taken any account of the value of on-farm production other than crops, and has presented no data that would allow that calculation to be made. Again, Brazil's approach is inconsistent with Annex IV, paragraph 2, pursuant to which the subsidy is allocated over "the total value of the recipient firm's sales." Brazil asserts that its "decision not to include any livestock value" is supported by the 1997 ARMS cotton costs of production survey, but that survey only shows that a small number of cotton farms in the survey year "specialized" in livestock production. Brazil does not define what "specialization" in livestock production would entail, but it would seem that a farm may have sales of a product without "specializing" in that product. The

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-815
evidence suggests that, had Brazil taken into account the value of non-crop on-farm production, the share of cotton as a per cent of total farm sales would be lower still. For example, in the 1997 ARMS cotton costs of production survey, the US Department of Agriculture found that, for 1997 when the value of cotton was high, cotton accounted for only 44.5 per cent of the total value of agricultural production on cotton farms.94
51. Brazil also fails to include off-farm economic activity, which can be substantial, in its calculation. Annex IV, paragraph 2, establishes that the non-tied subsidy is allocated over "the total value of the recipient firm's sales"; there is no basis in that provision to limit the sales over which the subsidy is allocated to farm sales. Brazil's refusal to apply the Annex IV methodology in full introduces yet another serious distortion in its calculation as cotton operations earn almost 30 per cent of income from off-farm sources.95
52. Finally, Brazil contests the notion that, in calculating the amount of subsidy benefiting upland cotton, it must take account of the fact that decoupled payments for base acres are capitalized into higher land values and cash rents, thus benefiting land owners, not necessarily those farming the land, referring the Panel to its 28 January comments.96 There, Brazil asserts that it is for the United States to demonstrate that payments on rented acres are capitalized into rents, thus impermissibly seeking to shift its burden of establishing the amount of challenged subsidies to the United States as responding party. Brazil also cites aggregate state-level data on cash rents to show that average cash rents in some cotton-producing states increased by less than the rate of inflation over the 1996-2002 period.97 Such analysis, however, ignores the aggregation bias introduced by averaging (1) cash rents from farmland with programme base with (2) cash rents from farmland without programme base.
53. We recall that Brazil has previously conceded that, as of marketing year 1997, 34 to 41 cents per dollar of production flexibility contract payments were capitalized into land rent.98 Brazil now argues that there is no evidence that further (increased) shares of production flexibility contract payments were capitalized in subsequent years. The Commission on the Application of Payment Limitations for Agriculture, to which Dr. Sumner presented testimony, reached conclusions on this very issue, however, and Brazil submitted this report as Exhibit BRA-276. The United States was therefore disappointed to see that Brazil's exhibit was missing pages 89-122, which precisely includes the portion of Chapter 5 of the Report entitled "Effects of Further Payment Limitations on Farmland Values." We attach as Exhibit US-155 the missing pages from the report.
54. The analysis of the Report of the Commission on the Application of Payment Limitations for Agriculture directly contradicts Brazil's conclusion that cash rent data "do [not] appear to reflect to any considerable extent the effects of PFC or other contract acreage payments".99 To the contrary, the Commission's Report explained:
In early 1997, professional farm managers indicated that in areas where competition for rental land was intense, PFC payments were almost immediately captured by landowners and reflected in rental rates and land values. Given the intense competition for leased land in many areas, tenants operating on cash leases found their lease rates being bid up until the landowner had captured most of the tenant's share of PFC payments. Producers with share leases reported that some landowners reduced their share of expenses, retained a larger crop share, or converted from share
94 See Exhibit BRA-16, table 3. 95 See US Further Rebuttal Submission, para. 137. 96 Brazil's 18 February Comments, para. 75. 97 See Brazil's Comments on US Answer to Panel Question 242, paras. 204-206 (28 January 2003). 98 Brazil's Answer to Question 179 from the Panel, para. 165 (27 October 2003); Brazil's Opening Statement at the Second Panel Meeting, para. 57. 99 Brazil's Comments on US Answer to Panel Question 242, para. 208 (28 January 2004).

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-816
leases to cash leases. However, in areas where competition for rental land was less intense, tenants retained much of their PFC payments (Ryan et al). Goodwin and Mishra estimate that each additional dollar per acre of PFC payments increased US average rents by $0.81 to $0.83 per acre during 1998-2000.100
Thus, the missing pages from Brazil's own exhibit reports that, during 1998-2000, an estimated average of 81 to 83 per cent of production flexibility contract payments were captured by landowners through increased rent.101 This conclusion is consistent with the US position that land owners capture the benefit of decoupled payments for base acres made to producers on rented land.102 The Report also extends its conclusions to market loss assistance payments, direct payments, and counter-cyclical payments.103
55. We also note Brazil's argument that counter-cyclical payments could not be captured by landowners through increased rent because the payments are "triggered on a year-by-year basis depending on low prices for upland cotton", and a landowner "cannot know in what amount CCP payments will be made".104 As noted, the Commission's Report does not support Brazil's position on counter-cyclical payments. However, Brazil does not draw the logical conclusion from its assertion: if that statement is true, then counter-cyclical payments cannot have effects on cotton farmers' planting decisions and production because farmers (and therefore landowners) cannot anticipate receiving those payments. On the other hand, to suggest that counter-cyclical payments do have production effects, Brazil has also argued that farmers do anticipate counter-cyclical payments being made.105 If that is true, then Brazil's own evidence demonstrates that those payments will be capitalized. Brazil cannot have it both ways.
56. In sum, Brazil's two "Annex IV" methodologies are wholly inadequate because Brazil does not even attempt to apply the methodology actually set out in Annex IV: that is, to allocate the value of a non-tied subsidy across "the total value of the recipient firm's sales". Brazil has never sought nor
100 Exhibit US-155, at 106 (italics added). 101 We also note that this information directly contradicts Brazil's previous argument that "contrary to the premise of the Panel's question [179], th[e] evidence suggests that PFC payments are somewhat, but not `largely capitalized' into land rents". Brazil's Answer to Question 179 from the Panel, para. 165 (27 October 2003). 102 Brazil also attempts to draw a distinction between land that is cash-rented versus share-rented. However, the Commission's Report describes a "non-operator landlord" as including those who "receiv[e] rent in the form of the crop produced on the land." Exhibit US-155, at 104. Thus, the Report's conclusions that the benefits of government payments largely accrue to non-operator landlords would appear to apply to owners who share-rent their land as well. 103 See, e.g., Exhibit US-155, at 106 ("Barnard et al. (2001) estimated that $62 billion or 20 per cent of the value of land producing the 8 major programme crops . . . was due to PFC payments, market loss assistance, disaster payments, and marketing loan benefits."); id. at 106 ("The effects of farm commodity payments on cropland values vary geographically, reflecting differences in . . . payments for crops eligible for direct and counter-cyclical payments and marketing loan benefits . . . ."); id. at 111 ("Government payments in the form of direct payments, counter-cyclical payments, and marketing loan benefits affect the value of farmland and land rents. Several studies indicate that government payments in recent years have increased farmland values nationally by 15-25 per cent.") 104 Brazil's Comments on US 22 December 2003 Answers, para. 209 (28 January 2003). Brazil goes on to say: "Further, as Brazil has demonstrated repeatedly, given the high non-land-related production costs involved in producing cotton, most US producers simply could not profitably produce cotton without CCP payments. Therefore, there is little, if any, basis for a non-producing landlord to demand increased rents to capture CCP payments". Id. The United States is puzzled by this assertion. It would appear that Brazil is saying that landlords would not charge higher rental rates because producers "could not profitably produce cotton without CCP payments". This is not our understanding of how landlords choose to set rental rates. 105 For example, in Dr. Sumner's model, acreage is a function of the net return to planting cotton, which includes prospective counter-cyclical payments. See Brazil's Further Submission, Annex I, para. 28 (equation (1)).

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-817
presented the value of total sales of the recipients (upland cotton producers) of the challenged decoupled income support payments. Brazil's inadequate calculations cannot meet its burden of establishing a prima facie case on decoupled income support payments for purposes of its serious prejudice claims.
Conclusion: Brazil's Interpretation of the Peace Clause Would Upset the Balance of Rights and Obligations of Members in the WTO Agreements
57. Throughout this dispute, we have noted that Brazil's Peace Clause interpretation is without foundation in the text and context of that provision and would upset the balance of rights and obligations set out in the Agreement on Agriculture. Brazil asserts that "[h]ad the United States been concerned about the certainty of its peace clause `protection,' it would not have been difficult for Congress, in the 1996 FAIR Act or even the 2002 FSRI Act, to include a `circuit breaker' provision directing the USDA Secretary to stop funding any upland cotton budgetary outlays in excess of the 1992 levels".106 Of course, the United States has disciplined itself to grant support not in excess of that decided during the 1992 marketing year by shifting away from the product-specific deficiency payments with high target prices under the 1990 Act and instead to provide a mix of decoupled income supports that are green box (direct payments) or non-product-specific (counter-cyclical payments) and product-specific marketing loan payments. But Brazil's assertion raises a number of questions:
· How could the United States have known how to cap the budgetary outlays under the decoupled income support measures to stay within the 1992 levels?
· How could the United States have known what payments would be considered "support to upland cotton" under Brazil's methodology, which only appeared on 20 January 2004?
· Which of Brazil's five in-the-alternative methodologies ­ the "cotton-to-cotton methodology", "Brazil's methodology", the "modified Annex IV methodology", the "US Annex IV methodology", or "Brazil's 14/16th methodology"107 ­ should the United States have been applying to ensure that budgetary outlays did not exceed the 1992 level?
Indeed, Brazil has ended this dispute taking the position that "the Panel needs to adopt a reasonable methodology to be applied for purposes of the peace clause in assessing the amount of support to upland cotton from the four contract payment programmes".108 It is difficult to imagine how that standard could have been incorporated into the design of the challenged decoupled income support measures to ensure Peace Clause compliance.
58. The United States submits that the Peace Clause must be interpreted in a way that permits Members to comply in good faith ­ that is, Members must be able to tell if they will breach the Peace Clause or not. Putting legal interpretive issues aside, Brazil's budgetary outlays approach does not do that since, with price-based support such as marketing loan payments, the United States cannot "decide" market prices.109 Brazil's allocation methodology also does not do that because the
106 Brazil's 18 February Comments, para. 85. 107 See, e.g., Brazil's 18 February Comments, para. 55. We note that the range of budgetary outlays Brazil calculates under these five in-the-alternative methodologies range from, for 2002 direct payments, $383.1 million to $466.8 million, and for 2002 counter-cyclical payments, from $640.4 million to $988.3 million. 108 Brazil's 18 February Comments, para. 42 (italics added). 109 We have previously noted that "support" does not mean "budgetary outlays". US 11 February Comments, para. 16 n.12. In addition, it is ironic that Brazil criticizes the US interpretation on the grounds that the Peace Clause does not read "product-specific support" when the Peace Clause also does not read "budgetary

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-818
United States does not "decide" what a decoupled income support recipient chooses to produce (or not to produce).110 Brazil's approach to Peace Clause issues would rob Members of the ability to design price-based and income support measures to conform to the Peace Clause and mean that Members could not know if they had complied with the Peace Clause until it was too late to do anything about it. 59. The United States has demonstrated that using any measurement that reflects the support "decided" by the United States ­ rather than factors (such as market prices) beyond the United States' control ­ US support to upland cotton in marketing years 1999-2002 has not exceeded the 1992 marketing year level.111 The question then is whether the Panel will find that the United States has breached the Peace Clause simply because market prices were lower in some recent years than they were in 1992. We have demonstrated that the United States has disciplined itself to grant support not in excess of that decided during the 1992 marketing year.112 Therefore, we are entitled to the protection of the Peace Clause and respectfully request the Panel to so find.
outlays"; however, the latter is a defined term in Article 1(b) of the Agreement on Agriculture while the former is not, suggesting that Members' decision not to use "budgetary outlays" in the Peace Clause was deliberate.
110 As set out above, no allocation methodology can be applied to the Peace Clause as the only support that is relevant to that determination is support to a specific commodity, read according to its ordinary meaning and in context.
111 See, e.g., US 11 February Comments, paras. 15-17. 112 Recognizing, as the United States believes is required by the Peace Clause text, that "decided" and "grant" cover only those parameters over which Members exercise control would also be consistent with this approach of allowing "good faith" compliance since it would permit Members to control whether their measures conformed to their obligations.

ANNEX I-24
RESPONSE OF THE UNITED STATES TO THE PANEL'S 3 FEBRUARY 2004 DATA REQUEST, AS CLARIFIED ON 16 FEBRUARY 2004
3 March 2004
Introduction
1. The United States is submitting today 8 data files, as requested by the Panel in its 3 February 2004, supplementary request for information, as clarified by the Panel's communication of 16 February 2004. The files are in an EXCEL format.
2. The data has been prepared in response to those letters, and has been prepared as well as possible in the time allotted, involving much time and effort. We first address how the files were derived and issues involved in their preparation, such as the handling of 1999 and 2000 crop soybeans and 2002 peanuts. Because of the peanut and soybean issues, there were in essence two runs of data, and both sets of data are presented.
3. In the first run, the United States ran the figures for 1999 and 2000 treating soybeans as a non-base crop, and thus one which would not effect any categorizations based on comparing plantings of total programme crops to total programme crop bases (such as those necessary to sort farms into B1, B2, and B3 categories). In the second run, soybeans were treated as a full programme crop for the Market Loss Assistance payments for those years in which oilseed payments were made (1999 and 2000) with an assigned base of zero for each farm as there were no farm bases for the soybean crops for 1999 and 2000.
4. Likewise, for peanuts, there were separate runs for 2002. In the first run, the peanut crops for Direct payments and Counter-cyclical payments were treated as a non-programme crop for categorization purposes. In the second run, peanuts were treated as a programme crop with a base of zero for each farm.
5. These two runs took into account the directive of the Panel of 16 February. There, the Panel instructed us to treat soybeans for Market Loss Assistance (MLA) as a programme crop and peanuts as a Direct and Counter-cyclical Payment (DCP) crop. As indicated, this did raise a question, one which is colored somewhat by a broader issue on the MLA payments themselves. There is no separate base acreage or yields for MLA purposes. And, the oilseed programmes for 1999 and 2000 were not farm based programmes. No farm had a soybean base for those years. Likewise, with peanuts, there was no farm base for 2002, the first year that peanuts became a programme crop. Bases were not assigned for peanuts until 2003 and could not be effective until that year. For 2002, the peanut programme was a producer-based programme. The same was true for soybeans in 1999 and 2000.
6. Finally, we also present the results of our efforts to identify any farms that would not have protectable privacy interests under the Privacy Act of 1974, as requested in item (a) of the Panel's 3 February supplementary request for information.
7. We then indicate how the files were put together and identify the files.

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-820
There were no Separate Market Loss Assistance Bases; Rather the Payments Were Made Proportionately to the Production Flexibility Contract (PFC) Payments
8. The market loss assistance payments (MLAs) were after the fact and simply supplemented payments that were made to a person under a PFC contract. There were no new contracts, bases, or yields. There were four MLA programmes. The first was for the 1998 crop. MLA programmes followed for the 1999, 2000 and 2001 crops, each under separate legislation, each after the fact ­ that is after the crop was planted and in supplement of payments already made under the PFC contracts.
9. To respond to the Panel's data request of 3 February 2004, the United States was called upon to give information for the PFCs and the MLAs. The data request was for base acreage with respect to farms that were in the programme. There were no bases as such for MLAs. The payments were proportional to what has been received in the PFC. The only slight difference was that for 2000, where Congress simply prescribed a rate, drawing from the previous statute for the previous crop. Thus, we have treated the request for MLA data (as explained below, soybeans aside) to be a request for the PFC data for the PFC year for which the PFC payment was supplemented by a particular MLA payment.
There Was No Soybean Farm Base for the 1999 and 2000 Market Loss Assistance Programme As There Were No Market Loss Assistance Programmes for Soybeans, and Oilseed Payments in those Years were Producer-Based, Not Farm-Based
10. Soybeans complicate the analysis. The United States reads the Panel's 16 February letter to indicate that for purposes of the data request, soybeans should be treated as an MLA crop. This presents an analytical problem because no farm had a soybean base. We note that the data files do contain for every category the soybean plantings for 1999 and 2000. (We note that there was no oilseed programme, and therefore no payments for soybeans, for 2001.)
11. As an initial matter, soybean payments for 1999 and 2000 were part of an overall oilseeds programme. There was no oilseed programme for the 2001 crop; therefore, there was no soybean payment of any kind for that year. There was never, even for 1999 and 2000, a base or yield for a farm for oilseeds in the PFC era.
12. For the PFC programme crops like cotton, the "farm" had a base. The "farm" had a yield. "Producers" on the farm received the payment even if they were not the same person who had produced the crops that produced the historic base or yield or had even been on the farm when the base or yield were created. If the producer had an interest in several farms with base under the PFC programmes, the producer received several checks. The base acreage and yield derived from historical plantings on the farm.
13. In the oilseeds programme, it was completely different. The producer had a base. The producer had a yield. The farm had no base. The farm had no yield. For the 1999 programme, if the producer was on Farm X in 1999 and planted soybeans there, the producer could receive a payment based on plantings that the producer may have had on Farms A, B, C, and D in the historical period. Current producers on Farms A, B, C, and D, by contrast, would have no "base." In short, there was no base for soybeans for any farm for oilseeds payments for 1999 or 2000.
14. Thus, this is the problem in terms of the data request for the Panel: the request considers soybeans as a covered commodity for MLAs and seeks information for base acreage on "farms," but soybean base for 1999 and 2000 oilseed payments was producer-based, not farm-based. In order to be as responsive as possible, we have run the data two ways. First, for 1999 and 2000, we treat soybeans as a non-programme crop for purposes of categorizing the farms into subcategories (as explained in more detail below), but show the actual soybean plantings for all farms. In the second run, we treat

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-821

soybeans as a programme crop and, for categorization purposes, treat all farms as having a soybean base of zero.

15. We respectfully refer the Panel to its 3 February 2004, letter. Category B farms are those with cotton "overplantings" ­ that is with more cotton plantings than cotton base. Category B2 farms are defined are those where, for all covered crops added together, the farm underplanted the total aggregated base. B3 is the mirror image of B2. It is where there was an aggregated overplanting for all programme crops taken together.

16. Assume the following plantings on Farm A:

Cotton

Base 10

Plantings 12

Rice

Base 5

Plantings 0

Soybeans

--

Plantings 5

If soybean plantings do not matter for categorization, then this farm is a B2 farm since the plantings for rice and cotton would be 12 and the total base would be 15. But if soybeans are counted and treated as having a zero base, then this farm is a B3 farm because the countable base would still be 15, but the plantings would now be 17. This would only be the case for MLA. Since soybeans, under the Panel's February 16 letter, would only be counted for MLAs, the farm would still be a B2 farm for purposes of the PFC calculations for the same year.

17. As we have indicated and set out further below, we have it covered both ways. We provide a file in which soybeans are treated as a covered commodity (for MLA purposes) with a farm base of zero. We also present a file in which soybeans are not considered a programme crop, in which the PFC and MLA figures are the same.

Farms Had No Peanut Base in 2002 Because the 2002 Peanut Programme was Producer-Based, Not Farm-Based

18. The Peanut programme presents the same problem for the 2002 Direct and Counter-cyclical Programme (DCP) as do soybeans for the 1999 and 2000 programmes, since it too was a producerbased, not a farm-based programme. There were no peanut bases for 2002 for any farm. The base was assigned to a producer for 2002. That producer had to be a "historical peanut producer" ­ someone who had produced peanuts in the base period. For the 2002 crop year, the producer received one check for all of the producer's base, calculated as the payment rate times the "payment acres of the historic cotton producer" times the "average peanut yield . . . for the historic cotton producer."1 However, starting in 2003, the base and yield had to be assigned by the historical producer to a farm of that producer's choice. The designated farm did not have to be a farm in which the producer had an interest, or one on which the producer had ever produced peanuts, or, for that matter, one on which anyone had ever produced peanuts or would ever produce peanuts in the future.

19. The distinction is perhaps best demonstrated by example. Assume that a farmer had in 19982001 produced peanuts on rented Farms A, B, and C. Assume that for 2002 the farmer decided to get out of farming altogether, and was living in retirement in Denver, Colorado, far outside the peanut belt and with no interest in any farm or any farm production anywhere. Under the terms of the 2002 Farm Bill, that historical producer would receive a payment based on that producer's base and that producer's yield. If that farmer happened to be a producer in 2002 on Farm D, that farmer would nonetheless receive payment based on his or her production on Farms A, B, and C in the base period.

1 2002 Farm Bill, § 1303(c) (direct payments) (Exhibit US-1); see id. § 1304(e) (counter-cyclical payments).

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-822
Producers in 2002 on Farms A, B, and C would receive nothing (unless they of course had their own producer base).
20. For 2003, however, the farmer living in Denver would have to pick a farm on which to place his base.
21. In short, there were no bases for any peanut farm in 2002, and the problem is the same as for soybeans. As for soybeans, the data was run both ways ­ that is, treating peanuts as a covered commodity for 2002 with a farm base of zero and not treating peanuts as a covered commodity.
How the Data was Compiled
22. The United States now explains the source of the data. We have previously mentioned the limitations of crop reports, which is from where all the planting data in the aggregations presented here are derived. Crop reports were not generally required until 2002, at which point they were required for persons seeking benefits for crops other than peanuts in the form of direct payments, counter-cyclical payments, or marketing loans. As for peanuts, similar reporting requirements apply where the payments are in connection with farms for which a base is assigned. Hence, the peanut reporting provision only begins to apply with the 2003 crop.
23. We note that the total number of acres accounted for in 2002 may exceed the total cropland numbers set out in the 18-19 December 2003 data, as corrected on 28 January 2004. Differences may result because: (1) farmers may have reported plantings of grass on noncropland; (2) there can be double-cropping in some areas; and (3) CRP acres may not have been reported and counted as available cropland.
The Categories of Farms for the Aggregated Data Files Responsive to Part "(b)" of the Panel's Request
24. We have sorted and aggregated the relevant farms into those categories set out in the 3 February supplementary request from the Panel. Category A farms are those for which the farms underplanted their cotton base. The panel also asked for farms that did not plant any other covered commodities and we have classified those as "A1" farms.
25. Category B farms are farms that overplanted their base. Subcategory B1 farms are farms that, in total for all base crops, planted exactly their covered commodity base, while B2 farms underplanted and B3 farms over-planted those total bases.
26. Category C farms planted cotton but had no base.
Data on Farms Without Privacy Interests Under the Privacy Act of 1974 As Set Out in Item (a) of the Panel's Request
27. We now address what was item (a) of the Panel's 3 February supplementary request for information. The Panel asked for information relating to those farms that do not have a privacy interest and thus who could potentially be subject to a detailed release of planted and base acreage information. This information appears to be of little interest to Brazil at this point as Brazil indicated in its 13 February letter that "because the United States apparently intends only to provide farmspecific information for far less than the total amount of farms (i.e., those that are not held by `individuals') this information will be useless for calculating the exact amount of total contract payments."2 By way of contrast, Brazil commented that, "[i]f the United States provides the complete information requested in part (b) of the 3 February 2004 Request, then most of Brazil's 28 January

Data Comments would be rendered moot," and "[w]ith the actual and complete data, the Panel would be in a position to apply any methodology it deems acceptable."3
28. For non-closely held corporations, information voluntarily received from a corporation is to be withheld if it is not the type of information customarily released by the corporation to the public. See Center for Auto Safety v. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 244 F.3d 144 (D.C. Cir. 2001).
29. Such is the case with respect to plantings prior to 2002. It would therefore, be necessary to examine, on a case by case basis, the circumstances of each "corporate" farming operation to determine if it is a closely held corporation which might enjoy a privacy interest and if the information was voluntarily submitted and not the type of information customarily released by the corporation to the public.
30. Given the time available, we used the year 2002 when in all cases, crop reports were mandatory with the limits indicated above. The United States conducted an electronic sort of cotton farms to narrow the number of files to a manageable number, which we then examined on a farm-byfarm basis to see if they were closely-held corporations. The data file containing farm-by-farm base, yield, and planted acreage information for these farms is described below.
The Data Files
31. The United States is providing the following data files via CD-ROM. This information is sensitive, and we do not consent to the release of this information to the public domain. Therefore, as with the data submitted on 18 and 19 December 2003, as corrected on 28 January 2004, pursuant to paragraph 3 of the Panel's working procedures, we designate this information as confidential.

Id. In light of the filing today of a complete response to item (b) of the Panel's supplementary request, the United States welcomes Brazil's withdrawal of its request that the Panel draw adverse inferences in this dispute.

ANNEX I-25
UNITED STATES' RESPONSE TO QUESTION 264(B) DATED 3 FEBRUARY 2004 FROM THE PANEL TO THE PARTIES FOLLOWING THE SECOND MEETING OF THE PANEL
3 March 2004
264. The Panel asks the United States to clarify certain aspects of Exhibit US-128:
(b) Does the US agree with the statement in paragraph 135 of Brazil's 28 January 2004 comments on US responses to questions that the difference between the $1,148 billion in the chart at para. 165 of Brazil's 11 August answers to questions and the $666 million amount in Exhibit US-128 ($1.75 billion) closely corresponds to the total "Claims rescheduled" figure reported by the US in Exhibit US-128 (column F)?
1. The United States first notes that Exhibit US-128 portrays data on a cohort basis. The figures in Brazil's chart are on a fiscal-year basis, which do not necessarily correspond to figures on a cohortbasis. In addition, data reflected in Exhibit US-128 commence with the 1992 cohort and end with the 2003 cohort. In contrast, Brazil's chart commences with fiscal year 1993 and ends with fiscal year 2002.
2. Also, as indicated in response to question 264(c)1, Exhibit US-128 does not reflect the receipt of principal payments under the reschedulings. Exhibit US-148 (column F) reflects approximately $205 million of principal collected on the reschedulings. As a theoretical matter, such "recovered principal" should be reflected in the budget line 88.40 that Brazil cites in its chart. Accounting research within the US Government suggests, however, that a significant portion of this amount has not in fact been reflected in that budget line.
3. Although the $1.75 billion number cited in the question and the $1.637 billion number pertaining to "claims rescheduled" are numerically of the same order of magnitude, for the reasons noted above, a direct comparison between Exhibit US-128 and Brazil's chart is not as appropriate or facile as Brazil would suggest. Nevertheless, as a general matter, the United States acknowledges that the most significant difference between the data reflected in Exhibit US-128 and the data in the Brazilian chart arises as a function of the standard accounting treatment of reschedulings by the Commodity Credit Corporation as no longer constituting an outstanding claim, but in fact a new direct
1 US Answers to Further Panel Questions Following Second Panel Meeting (11 February 2004), para. 24

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-826
loan.2 This is consistent with standard commercial practice in accounting for refinancings and reschedulings.3 Such treatment is reflected in column F of Exhibit US-128.

2 Under FASAB: Original Pronouncements, Version 3 (01/2004), a "direct loan" is defined as "a

disbursement of funds by the government to a nonfederal borrower under a contract that requires the repayment

of such funds within a certain time with or without interest. The term includes the purchase of, or participation

in, a loan made by another lender.

(Adapted from OMB Circular A-11)."

http://www.fasab.gov/pdffiles/vol1v3.pdf, p. 1290. Section 185.3 of OMB Circular A-11 defines "direct loan":

"a disbursement of funds by the Government to a non-Federal borrower under a contract that requires repayment

of such funds with or without interest. The term includes: [. . .] Financing arrangements that defer payment for

more than 90 days [. . .]." Exhibit BRA-116 (section 185.3, page 185-6). 3 In a routine case, a lender upon rescheduling or refinancing a loan would extinguish the prior loan

because payments are no longer due on the original schedule. The lender simultaneously would book the new

rescheduled loan as the asset (receivable) pursuant to the terms of which payments would be received. Perhaps

the most familiar illustration of this type of transaction is a home mortgage refinancing where the applicable

interest rate and maturity are changed from the prior mortgage loan. Upon consummation of the refinancing, the

original note and mortgage are deemed paid, and the new loan and its terms are booked as the new loan

receivable.

I. INTRODUCTION
1. Brazil thanks the Panel for the opportunity to comment on the US data produced on 3 March 2004. Section II of this submission provides Brazil's comments on the completeness and usability of the 3 March 2004 US data. In Section III, Brazil presents the results of its calculations applying the same allocation methodologies as used in Brazil's 18 February 2004 Data Comments. In Section IV, Brazil offers four tables comparing MY 1992 support to upland cotton with MY 19992002 support to upland cotton as determined under the four allocation methodologies.
2. Brazil's results ­ whether based off the 3 March 2004 US summary data or the earlier US 18/19 December 2003 or 28 January 2004 summary data ­ remain unchanged. Under any reasonable methodology for allocating contract payment support to upland cotton, the US support to upland cotton in MY 1999-2002 exceeds the support decided in MY 1992, within the meaning of Article 13(b)(ii) of the Agreement on Agriculture. Thus, the US domestic support measures challenged by Brazil in this dispute are not "exempt from actions" under the SCM Agreement and GATT Article XVI.
II. THE US 3 MARCH 2004 DATA REGARDING PART B OF THE PANEL'S 3 FEBRUARY 2004 REQUEST IS GENERALLY USABLE AND SHOULD BE RELIED ON BY THE PANEL
3. Given the US refusal to provide farm-specific data, the aggregated data provided by the United States on 3 March 2004 in response to part (b) of the Panel's 3 February 2004 Request is the best information available before the Panel. While certain problems with the US 3 March 2004 data remain (which particularly affect any value-based Annex IV-type allocation methodology), the Panel can and should rely on this data in making its peace clause determination. Thus, Brazil notes that it no longer considers that relying on its "14/16th" methodology would be appropriate.
4. With respect to part (b) of the Panel's 3 February 2004 Request, the United States appears to have provided complete summary base and complete summary planted acreage data covering all crops for which data was requested by the Panel and all farms covered by the Panel's request.
5. However, the United States has engaged in a completely incorrect reading of the Panel's request for data on Category A farms. The Panel defined Category A farms as "farms [that] had fewer upland cotton planted acres than upland cotton base acres".1 Unfortunately, the United States read this request as covering all farms that had upland cotton base and planted less than their full upland cotton base to upland cotton or that planted no upland cotton at all.2 There is no basis for any such interpretation. Farms with no planted acres do not have "fewer upland cotton planted acres" ­ which refers to a positive amount ­ they have none. Indeed, from the context of the Panel's 3 February 2004 Request is becomes clear that the entire purpose of the Panel's request was to facilitate the calculation of support to upland cotton, within the meaning of Article 13(b)(ii) of the Agreement on Agriculture. Neither Brazil, nor the United States, has ever argued that farms, which do not even plant upland cotton, receive any "support to upland cotton". Including these farms in the calculations would inevitably lead to major distortions, as the calculations are impacted by base and planted acreage on farms that are of no relevance to a determination of the "support to upland cotton".3 Had the United States interpreted the Panel's request according to its ordinary meaning, or, alternatively,
1 3 February 2004 Communication from the Panel, p. 1 (emphasis added). 2 This is apparent from the fact that the sum of all upland cotton base acres from Category A, B and C farms in the US 3 March 2004 summary data equals the amount of total upland cotton base in the United States. Logically, farms that gave up producing upland cotton must have been included in one of the categories and could only have been included in Category A. Indeed, this inclusion explains that large amount of upland cotton base relative to the upland cotton planted acreage on these farms. 3 Brazil notes that this problem does not affect the Cotton-To-Cotton Methodology, as discussed below.

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-830
provided the farm-specific information requested by the Panel on 8 December 2003, 12 January 2004 and 3 February 2004 (as part (a) of the Panel's Request4), this would not have been a problem.
6. Nevertheless, Brazil has been able to use the 28 January 2004 US summary data to largely correct for this erroneous inclusion of additional non-upland cotton producing farms in Category A. The 28 January 2004 US summary data contains a separate category for farms that hold upland cotton base but do not produce upland cotton. Brazil has used this aggregate information to subtract out of Category A data any base and planted acreage on farms that do not produce upland cotton.5 However, this approach was not feasible for the US Annex IV Methodology, since the 28 January 2004 US summary data does not contain all the data items contained in the 3 March 2004 US summary data. In particular, specific data on planted acreage for non-contract payment crops is missing from the 28 January 2004 US summary data, limiting Brazil's ability to correct all Category A farm data items for the purposes of applying the data to the US Annex IV Methodology. Similarly, a correction was not feasible for soybean planted acreage during MY 1999-2001 and for peanut planted acreage in MY 2002, as discussed below. Thus, any remaining distortions that might result from the necessary exclusion of soybeans and peanuts of Brazil's calculations under Brazil's Methodology and under the Modified Annex IV Methodology are directly a result of the US erroneous inclusion of non-upland cotton producing farms in Category A (and its continued refusal to produce farm-specific data).
7. In addition, and again in contrast with the 28 January 2004 US summary data, the United States' 3 March 2004 response does not provide contract payment yields or payments units that would allow for a precise calculation of the total amounts of contract payments received by a category of farms. While Brazil recognizes that the Panel's 3 February 2004 Request does not ask for this information, the United States should have produced in good faith the information on payment units in order to avoid potential distortions (as it did when providing its 18/19 December 2003 and 28 January 2004 summary data). Brazil has been required, therefore, to use the contract payment yield information set out in the 28 January 2004 US summary data. Brazil believes this contract payment yield information to be a useful proxy and the potential distortions that might result from the use of this data to be relatively minor.6
8. The United States' 3 March 2004 summary data is furthermore inadequate because it does not permit the calculation of support from soybean market loss assistance payments and peanut direct and counter-cyclical payments. The United States notes that MY 1999-2000 soybean market loss assistance payments and MY 2002 peanut direct and counter-cyclical payments were not "farmbased" but "producer-based".7 Therefore, payments were received by (historic) producers, rather than farms (or their owners). While the United States produced data on soybean and peanut planted acreage on upland cotton farms8, the United States did not produce any information that would allow
4 Brazil notes that it is of the firm view that none of the farm-specific planting data requested by the Panel would be covered by the US Privacy Act.
5 Brazil has subtracted from the Category A summary data provided on 3 March 2004 the amount of planted and base acreage per covered commodity as reported in the 28 January 2004 US summary data for farms that hold upland cotton base but do not plant upland cotton. This calculation corrects for any erroneous inclusion of additional farms in Category A. Since the 28 January 2004 US summary data does not contain data on MY 1999-2001 soybean plantings or base and MY 2002 peanut plantings or base by farms holding upland cotton base but not producing upland cotton, no correction is possible that would cover these crops. Therefore, both soybeans (for MY 1999-2001) and peanuts (for MY 2002) needed to be excluded from the calculations under Brazil's Methodology or the value-based allocation calculations under the Modified Annex IV Methodology, as discussed below. In addition, no update of the US-Proposed Annex IV Methodology using the US 3 March 2004 summary data was possible.
6 The United States obviously has no basis to complain about Brazil's use of this yield proxy given its failure to provide yield information on 3 March 2004 or to provide the farm-specific data.
7 US 3 March 2004 Response to the 3 February 2004 Request by the Panel, paras. 10-21. 8 The United States produced for MY 1999, 2000 and 2002 two sets of data, one treating soybeans and peanuts as a contract payment crop and categorizing farms accordingly and one treating the soybeans and

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-831
the calculation of "producer-based" soybean market loss assistance and peanut direct and countercyclical payments received by producers operating upland cotton farms.9 Yet, these payments should be considered under any allocation exercise (except the "Cotton-To-Cotton" Methodology). The absence of this information prevents Brazil from including these payments in its allocation calculations and, thus, biases Brazil's calculations downward, as discussed below. Any distortions resulting from this shortcoming of the 3 March 2004 us summary data are a consequence of the US failure to produce data on these soybean and peanut payments.
9. With respect to part (a) of the Panel's 3 February 2004 Request pursuant to DSU Article 13, the US 3 March 2004 response provided ­ after four weeks of what the United States characterizes as an analysis "involving much time and effort"10 ­ a file ("NotClose.xls") containing farm-specific data on 28 farms for MY 2002 that would not be covered by the US Privacy Act. At the same time, the United States indicated that, in MY 2002, 197,084 farms produced upland cotton and/or received upland cotton direct and counter-cyclical payments. It is obvious that the farm-specific data covering these 28 farms cannot provide information relevant to this dispute.11
10. Brazil reiterates that it does not consider farm-specific planting information to be covered by the US Privacy Act.12 (Certainly, Brazil's summary calculations in Sections III and IV below, based on the 3 March 2004 US summary data, could not possibly be considered confidential.) But even if the farm-specific planting information were confidential under US law, DSU Article 13 would oblige the United States to produce the information for the Panel and Brazil.13 Brazil also emphasizes that it remains of the view that farm-specific data would permit the most precise calculation of the amount of contract payments that constitute support to upland cotton, under whichever allocation methodology the Panel deems appropriate.14
III. CALCULATION OF SUPPORT TO UPLAND COTTON UNDER VARIOUS ALLOCATION METHODOLOGIES
11. In this Section, Brazil presents the results of applying the four allocation methodologies discussed in Section 5 of Brazil's 18 February 2004 Data Comments. That is, Brazil has applied two acreage-based allocation methodologies ("`Cotton-To-Cotton' Methodology" and "Brazil's Methodology") and two value-based methodologies ("Modified Annex IV Methodology" and "US Annex IV Methodology") to the 3 March 2004 US summary data.15 The results under Brazil's
peanuts as a non-contract payment crop and categorizing farms accordingly. (See US 3 March 2004 Response to the 3 February 2004 Request by the Panel, paras. 17, 21, 31-38).
9 As discussed above, no payment units are provided with the US 3 March 2004 summary data. 10 US 3 March 2004 Response to the Panel's 3 February 2004 Request. 11 See Brazil's 13 February 2004 Letter to the Panel, p. 2. 12 Brazil's 18 February 2004 Comments, comments regarding answers 259(a)-(c), paras. 1-21. See also Brazil's 28 January 2004 Data Comments, Section 4. 13 See Brazil's 28 January 2004 Data Comments, Section 5. 14 While Brazil stated at page 5 of its 13 February 2004 Letter to the Panel that "by producing the complete aggregated information, there would no longer be a need to draw adverse inferences", Brazil notes that the data produced by the United States is not complete, as discussed above. Should the United States argue or the Panel believe that Brazil ought to have provided more accurate data on contract payments that constitute support to upland cotton, Brazil requests the Panel to rely nevertheless on the calculations provided by Brazil in this submission. Any shortcoming in these results stems from the refusal of the United States to produce the farm-specific data requested numerous times by the Panel and Brazil. Further, the United States' refusal (1) to produce the farm-specific data or (2) to produce proper data on Category A farms by excluding all farms that do not produce upland cotton, as well as complete contract payment yield or payment unit information would permit the Panel to draw the adverse inferences that this information ­ if produced ­ would have shown even higher payments being allocated to upland cotton (see Brazil's 28 January 2004 Data Comments, Section 6). 15 While Brazil uses these results for purposes of the comparison required under Article 13(b)(ii) of the Agreement on Agriculture, the Panel could also use these results to determine the amount of subsidies provided

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-832

Methodology replace the estimated amount of support to upland cotton under Brazil's so-called "14/16th" methodology.
Cotton-To-Cotton Methodology16

12. First, Brazil has applied the "Cotton-To-Cotton" Methodology to the 3 March 2004 US summary data.17 This methodology is not affected by the Category A "over-inclusiveness" problem.18
The "Cotton-To-Cotton" Methodology allocates for each planted acre of upland cotton payments
associated with one upland cotton base acre ­ if available for that category of farms. For Category A
farms this means that for each acre planted to upland cotton, payments associated with one upland cotton base acre are allocated.19 For Category B1 to B3 farms this means that for each acre planted to
upland cotton, payments associated with one upland cotton base acre are allocated ­ up to the amount of upland cotton base acres held by these farms.20 For category C farms this means that no allocations are made.21

13. Since the 3 March 2004 US summary data did not include information on contract payment
yields or payment units by farm category, Brazil used the contract payment yield figures provided or implied in the 28 January 2004 US summary data to calculate payment amounts.22 After correcting
for and eliminating the non-upland cotton producing farms in Category A, Categories A, B1, B2 and
B3 consist of farms that previously were included in Category 1 under the US 18/19 December 2003 and 28 January 2004 summary data, as farms planting upland cotton and holding upland cotton base.23

to upland cotton for purposes of Brazil's actionable subsidy claims, should the Panel deem a finding on the

amount of subsidies necessary. 16 See Brazil's 18 February 2004 Data Comments, paras. 46-48 and Annex A.1. 17 For the reasons discussed below in the context of "Brazil's Methodology," Brazil has relied on the

categorization treating soybeans in MY 1999-2000 and peanuts in MY 2002 as a non-contract payment crop.

That is, Brazil has used the following files: `PFC1999W.xls', `PFC2000W.xls', `PFC 2001W.xls' and

`DCP2002W.xls' as provided by the United States on 3 March 2004. While the "Category A" problem does not

affect this methodology, to ensure comparability between the payment allocations for each category of farms,

Brazil has used the same categorization as for the calculations under Brazil's Methodology. 18 Since Category A consists of farms that have more upland cotton base acres than upland cotton

planted acres, for each planted acre of upland cotton payments associated with one upland cotton base acre are

allocated. All remaining upland cotton and other crop base payments are ignored. 19 Brazil recalls that these farms are defined as farms that plant less acres of upland cotton than they

hold base acres. 20 Brazil recalls that these farms are defined as farms that plant more acres of upland cotton than they

hold base acres. Thus, there are not enough upland cotton base acres to allocate payments associated with one

upland cotton base acre to each acre planted to upland cotton. No additional allocations are applied under this

methodology and, therefore, some upland cotton planted acres are not allocated contract payments at all. 21 Brazil recalls that these farms are defied as farms that plant upland cotton but do not hold upland

cotton base acres. Therefore, no upland cotton contract payments are available for allocation and no non-upland

cotton contract payments are allocated under this methodology. 22 The file `rPFCsum.xls' contains payment units and base acres per category of farms (1, 2, and 3

referring to farms that (1) hold upland cotton base and plant upland cotton, (2) hold upland cotton base and do

not plant upland cotton, and (3) do not hold upland cotton base but plant upland cotton). Since payment units

are defined as 85 per cent of the product of base acres and contract yields, payment units and base acres can be

used to calculate the required contract yield (payment units / (base acres * 0.85)). The file `rDCPsum.xls'

contains contract yields for all three categories of farms (see above). 23 To avoid any confusion, Brazil presents the following table detailing the nomenclature of the farm

categories in the various US summary data submissions:

Included in Category 1

also includes farms that

formerly Category 2 farms)

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-833

Accordingly, Brazil applied the contract payment yield for Category 1 farms from the 28 January 2004 US summary data to these four categories of farms in the 3 March 2004 US summary data.24 The contract payment yield for Category C farms under the 3 March 2004 US summary data corresponds to that of Category 3 farms under the 28 January 2004 US categorization.
14. Next, Brazil calculated the payment units by category of farms25 and multiplied them by the payment rate.26 The details of Brazil's calculations are presented (by farm category) in electronic form as Exhibit Bra-433 (`Calculations Acreage Based Methodologies.xls').

15. The following table shows the amount of contract payments allocated as support to upland cotton under the "Cotton-To-Cotton" Methodology.

24 Any possible distortion stemming from slightly higher or lower contract yields in Categories A, B1,
B2 and B3 than the average contract yield that was reported for category 1 farms in the 28 January 2004
summary data is due to the failure of the United States to provide more specific information. 25 85 per cent of the product of base acres and contract yields (using the applicable contract yields). 26 Exhibit Bra-394 (Agricultural Outlook Tables, USDA, November 2003, Table 17). 27 For details of the calculations, see Exhibit Bra-433 (`Calculations Acreage Based
Methodologies.xls'). 28 As in previous calculations (see Brazil's 28 January 2004 Data Comments, Section 9 and 10;
Brazil's 18 February 2004 Data Comments, Annex A), market loss assistance payments have been calculated by
adjusting the PFC payment according to the ratio of total upland cotton market loss assistance payments to total
upland cotton PFC payments (Exhibit Bra-4 ("Fact Sheet: Upland Cotton," USDA, January 2003, p. 6). The
United States has never criticized this approach and, in fact, confirmed its accuracy in paragraphs 8-9 of its
3 March 2004 response to the 3 February 2004 Request by the Panel. 29 See Brazil's 20 January 2004 Answers to Questions, paras. 43-55; Brazil's 28 January 2004 Data
Comments, Section 9 and Brazil's 18 February 2004 Data Comments, paras. 50-51, Section 6 and Annex A.2. 30 For instance, Brazil has deducted the amount of upland cotton base held by farms that hold upland
cotton base but do not produce upland cotton (as provided by the United States on 28 January 2004) from the
amount of upland cotton base held by Category A farms (as provided by the United States in 3 March 2004). A
similar deduction has been applied to base and planted acres for each crop for which such data was available in
the 28 January 2004 US summary data.

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-834

provided by the 28 January 2004 summary data31, and the payment rates32 to calculate the amount of contract payments by category of farms.33 Brazil recalls that its methodology allocates for each acre
planted to a contract payment crop payments associated with one base acre of that crop ­ as available.
All further contract payments not allocated to their respective contract payment crop are pooled and
allocated proportionally to the planted acres of contract payment crops to which no contract payments have been assigned under the first step.34

17. For the purposes of Brazil's methodology, Brazil treats soybeans as a non-contract payment crop for purposes of MY 1999 and 2000 market loss assistance payments35 and peanuts as a non-
contract payment crop for purposes of MY 2002 direct and counter-cyclical payments. This treatment
follows from Brazil's inability to correct the Category A data concerning soybean and peanut plantings, discussed above.36 In addition and as discussed above, Brazil has not been able to allocate
any MY 1999-2000 soybean market loss assistance payments or MY 2002 peanut direct and counter-
cyclical payments because no data on these payments has been provided. Accordingly, soybeans and
peanuts neither receive contract payment allocations, nor are soybean and peanut contract payments
allocated for the relevant marketing years.

18. The details of Brazil's calculations are presented (by farm category) in electronic form as
Exhibit Bra-433 (`Calculations Acreage Based Methodologies.xls'). Brazil applied the very same
calculation methodology as in its 28 January 2004 Data Comments and in its 18 February 2004 Data Comments.37 This methodology is not entirely identical to Brazil's 20 January 2004 discussion of its
methodology, which anticipated the use of farm-specific data that was never produced by the United States.38 Thus, certain adjustments, documented in Brazil's 28 January 2004 Data Comments, were necessary.39

31 See above discussion in the context of the "Cotton-To-Cotton" Methodology and Section II. 32 Exhibit Bra-394 (Agricultural Outlook Tables, USDA, November 2003, Table 17). 33 Brazil has used the following files: `PFC1999W.xls', `PFC2000W.xls', `PFC 2001W.xls' and

`DCP2002W.xls' as provided by the United States on 3 March 2004. 34 Brazil's 20 January 2004 Answers to Additional Questions, paras. 43-55. 35 Brazil recalls that the United States has informed Brazil and the Panel that there were no such

soybean payments in MY 2001. See US 3 March 2004 Response to the 3 February 2004 Request by the Panel,

Acreage

Based

Methodologies.xls'). 41 As in previous calculations (see Brazil's 28 January 2004 Data Comments, Section 9 and 10;

Brazil's 18 February 2004 Data Comments, Annex A), market loss assistance payments have been calculated by

adjusting the PFC payment according to the ratio of total upland cotton market loss assistance payments to total

upland cotton PFC payments (Exhibit Bra-4 ("Fact Sheet: Upland Cotton", USDA, January 2003, p. 6). The

United States has never criticized this approach and, in fact, confirmed its accuracy in paragraphs 8-9 of its 3

March 2004 response to the 3 February 2004 Request by the Panel.

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-835

20. The differences between results of the "Cotton-To-Cotton" Methodology and Brazil's Methodology result from the fact that under Brazil's Methodology a limited amount of non-upland cotton contract payments is allocated as "support to upland cotton." However, the great majority of upland cotton is planted on farms holding upland cotton base acres and their amount of upland cotton base acres closely tracks their amount of upland cotton planted acres. Thus, upland cotton contract payments account for the great majority of contract payments allocated even under Brazil's methodology. The following table presents, by marketing year, the amount of upland cotton planted acres for which there exists a corresponding upland cotton base acre farm category.

Modified US Annex IV Methodology44

21. In applying the first value-based methodology, the Modified Annex IV Methodology, to the new 3 March 2004 US summary data, Brazil again corrected for the over-inclusiveness of Category A and applied contract payment yields, as provided by the 28 January 2004 summary data, and the contract payment rates to calculate the total amount of contract payments by category of farms.45
22. Brazil was required to exclude soybeans46 and peanuts from the allocation calculations under this methodology47 (as well as under Brazil's Methodology) for the following reasons: First, since the United States did not provide data on soybean and peanut plantings with its 28 January 2004 summary data, Brazil is unable to correct these data items in the US 3 March 2004 Category A summary data.48 There were three theoretical options available to Brazil to address this problem. First, Brazil could have left in Category A all farms which were included by the United States, but which do not produce upland cotton. This approach would have resulted in distortions because considerable amounts of extra contract payments received by farms not producing upland cotton as well as unknown amounts of extra contract payment crop value generated by these non-upland cotton producing farms would be included in the calculations. Or, second, Brazil could have corrected the over-inclusiveness of

42 Brazil has used the following files: `PFC1999W.xls', `PFC2000W.xls', `PFC 2001W.xls' and
`DCP2002W.xls' as provided by the United States on 3 March 2004. 43 For Category A farms, Brazil has used the amount of upland cotton planted acres, since on those
farms upland cotton base acres exceed upland cotton base acres. For the three Categories B1, B2 and B3, Brazil
has used upland cotton base acres since for those farms upland cotton planted acres exceed upland cotton base
acres. Finally, for Category C farms, Brazil has used "0," since those farms have no upland cotton base acres. 44 Brazil has discussed this methodology in paragraphs 50-51 and in Annex A.3 of its 18 February 2004
Data Comments. 45 See above discussion in the context of the "Cotton-To-Cotton" Methodology and in Section II. 46 This exclusion of soybeans does not apply to MY 2002, for which complete summary data is
available. 47 Consequently, Brazil has used to following files as the basis for its calculations: `PFC1999W.xls',
`PFC2000W.xls', `PFC 2001W.xls' and `DCP2002W.xls' as provided by the United States on 3 March 2004. 48 This correction of course concerns the amount of soybean and peanut acreage planted by farms that
do not produce upland cotton.

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-836
Category A for all data items that it could correct leaving the additional soybean and peanut acreage from non-upland cotton producing farms in the pool. This approach would have resulted in distortions because unknown amounts of extra value of soybean and peanut production from nonupland cotton producing farms would be included in the calculations. To avoid these distortions, Brazil has selected the third option ­ to exclude soybeans and peanuts from the allocation. This choice enables Brazil to correct the Category A data for the inclusion of farms not producing upland cotton, in the manner described above49, and to proceed with its calculations.
23. Second, Brazil notes that the United States distinguishes the soybean market loss assistance and peanut direct and counter-cyclical payments in MY 1999, 2000 and 2002 as being producer-based rather than farm-based payments. But, the United States never provided information on the amount of these payments. However, payments received by producers of these crops that also owned upland cotton producing farms (to which all other contract payments were made) would need to be considered for any allocations methodology (except the "Cotton-To-Cotton" Methodology).
24. No doubt Brazil's choice not to include soybean and peanut planted acreage and soybean market loss assistance and peanut direct and counter-cyclical payments leads to distortions. These are unavoidable given the incorrect US reading of the definition of Category A farms. However, Brazil believes that these distortions are relatively minor. Brazil has excluded payments stemming from soybean market loss assistance and peanut direct and counter-cyclical payments50 as well as the crop value of soybean (for MY 1999-2001) and peanut (for MY 2002) production.51 Thus, soybeans and peanuts do not contribute contract payments to the pool of payments allocated over the value of the entire contract payment crop production of upland cotton producing farms. But, there are also no contract payments being allocated to soybeans and peanuts for these years. This minimizes distortions by roughly cancelling out over and under-counting effects from their exclusion from the calculation. Brazil notes that, for other crops, the amount of crop plantings and crop payment base is fairly proportionate.52 Soybeans and peanuts in all likelihood follow a similar pattern. In excluding these crops entirely from the calculations, Brazil minimizes the distortions resulting from the shortcomings of the 3 March 2004 US summary data, based on the assumption that these crops would contribute an equal (or very similar) amount of contract payments to the pool, as they would be allocated based on their share of the total value of contract payment crop production.
25. As in its 18 February 2004 calculations, Brazil calculated, by category of farm, the value of each contract payment crop produced on farms that make up the category. Brazil multiplied the amount of planted acreage times the yield53 and times the per unit price of the particular crop.54 Total contract payments for each category of farm were then allocated to upland cotton according to the share of the upland cotton crop value of the total value of contract payment crop production on the farms of that category. The details of Brazil's calculations are presented (by farm category) in electronic form as Exhibit Bra-434 (`Calculations Value Based Methodologies.xls').
26. The table below shows the resulting support to upland cotton under this methodology.
49 See Section II above. 50 For which the United States has not provided any payment information. 51 For which Brazil is not able to correct the Category A data given the respective data items missing in the 28 January 2004 US summary data. 52 Compare crop base and crop plantings as reported by the US 3 March 2004 summary data (`PFC1999W.xls', `PFC2000W.xls', `PFC 2001W.xls' and `DCP2002W.xls'). 53 Brazil notes that similar to its 18 February 2004 calculations it has used yields on planted acres for upland cotton and yields on harvested acres for all other contract payment crops, thereby overstating the latter's value and leading to understated allocations of contract payments to upland cotton. See Brazil's 18 February 2004 Data Comments, para. 73 and Annex A.3, notes to Tables 3.5-3.8 for further explanation and references to the data. 54 Exhibit Bra-420 (Agricultural Outlook Tables, USDA, November 2003, Table 17). Brazil notes that the cover page of this exhibit appears to be wrong. The table is, however, correct.

Brazil notes that these allocations are conservative. Absent data on yields per planted acre for any non-upland cotton crop, Brazil applied yields on harvested acres to calculate the amount of crop produced from all planted acres, thereby ignoring abandonment. This calculation leads to overstating the value of non-upland cotton crop production by overstating the amount of such production. By contrast, the value of the upland cotton crop has been calculated by using yields on planted acres, providing an accurate estimate.57 Thus, Brazil's calculations overstate the value of non-upland cotton contract payment crops produced in each of the farm categories, resulting in lower allocations to upland cotton.

US Annex IV Methodology

27. Brazil could not perform any updated calculations under this methodology based on the 3 March 2004 US summary data. The reason is that Brazil could not exclude from Category A data those farms that do not produce upland cotton.58 The US Annex IV Methodology would necessitate adjusting Category A data, inter alia, concerning planted soybeans acreage in MY 1999-2001 and peanut acreage in MY 2002. However, no such planted acreage data is available in the 28 January 2004 US summary data and, therefore, no such adjustment to Category A can be performed.

28. Further, for MY 2002, the 3 March 2004 US summary data provides more specific data items, including acreage data for fruits and vegetables, ELS cotton, tobacco and peanuts for all categories of farms. However, because these data items were also not provided in the 28 January 2004 US summary data, Brazil cannot correct the over-inclusiveness of Category A for these data items. In addition, the United States appears to have included more acreage in its "All Other Use Acres" than simply cropland. The sum of all non-contract payment crop acres in the 3 March 2004 US summary data exceeds the additional cropland as reported in the 28 January 2004 US summary data. This again

55 For details of the calculations, see Exhibit Bra-434 (`Calculations Value Based Methodologies.xls'). 56 As in previous calculations (see Brazil's 28 January 2004 Data Comments, Section 9 and 10; Brazil's 18 February 2004 Data Comments, Annex A), market loss assistance payments have been calculated by adjusting the PFC payment according to the ratio of total upland cotton market loss assistance payments to total upland cotton PFC payments (Exhibit Bra-4 ("Fact Sheet: Upland Cotton," USDA, January 2003, p. 6). The United States has never criticized this approach and, in fact, confirmed its accuracy in paragraphs 8-9 of its 3 March 2004 response to the 3 February 2004 Request by the Panel. 57 See Brazil's 18 February 2004 Data Comments, para. 73 and Annex A.3, notes to Tables 3.5-3.8 for further explanation and references to the data. 58 As long as only data concerning contract payment crops was relevant (excluding soybeans and peanuts under the Modified Annex IV Methodology), such an exclusion could be performed based on the 28 January 2004 US summary data, that provided congruous base and planted acreage summary information for these contract payment crops on farms that are now erroneously included in Category A. This allowed for deducting the base and planted acreage summary data for contract payment crops on farms that hold upland cotton base but do not produce upland cotton from the identical summary data items in Category A of the 3 March 2004 US summary data. For instance, Brazil has deducted the amount of upland cotton base held by farms that hold upland cotton base but do not produce upland cotton (as provided by the United States on 28 January 2004) from the amount of upland cotton base held by Category A farms (as provided by the United States in 3 March 2004). A similar deduction has been applied to base and planted acres for each crop for which such data was available in the 28 January 2004 US summary data.

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-838

precludes an adjustment of this data item in Category A for its over-inclusiveness, since the 28 January 2004 and the 3 March 2004 sets of summary data do not appear to be congruous.

29. Once more, the inability to exclude the non-upland cotton producing farms from Category A is important, because including a large number of farms that do not produce upland cotton in the allocation calculations would add a large potential for distortions given the significant amounts of plantings and contract payment crop base by these farms.

30. Further, while the 28 January 2004 US summary data provided information on the amount of non-contract payment crop acreage for MY 1999-2001, the 3 March 2004 US summary data fails to do so. Thus, for those marketing years and for purposes of the US Annex IV Methodology, Brazil could not rely on the 3 March 2004 US summary data and categorization of upland cotton farms at all, since the 3 March 2004 US summary data does not contain any information on the plantings of noncontract payment crops on these farms. For purposes of the US Annex IV Methodology, Brazil, however, needs to rely on planting data for non-contract payment crops to estimate the value of their production on upland cotton producing farms ­ data such as that provided by the United States in its 18/19 December 2003 and 28 January 2004 data submissions. Thus, Brazil's 18 February 2004 US Annex IV Methodology results based on the 28 January 2004 US summary data are more accurate than any calculations that could be performed based on the 3 March 2004 US summary data or some adjusted version thereof. Therefore, Brazil reproduces below its 18 February 2004 results applying the US Annex IV methodology to the 28 January 2004 US summary data.

Brazil notes that these allocations are conservative for two reasons: (1) the calculations overstate the
value of non-upland cotton contract payment crops, as discussed in the context of the Modified
Annex V Methodology; and (2) the calculations do not account for soybean market loss assistance payments in MY 1999-2000 and peanut direct and counter-cyclical payments in MY 2002.60

IV. THE UNITED STATES MY 1999-2002 SUPPORT TO UPLAND COTTON EXCEEDS THE MY 1992 SUPPORT TO UPLAND COTTON UNDER ANY METHODOLOGY

31. In the previous Section, Brazil has updated its 18 February 2004 calculations of the support to upland cotton applying various acreage- and value-based allocation methodologies. In this Section, Brazil combines its results with data on the amount of support to upland cotton from the other support programmes, and provides the Panel with summary tables for each of the 1999-2002 marketing years comparing the support to upland cotton in those marketing years with the MY 1992 level of support to upland cotton.

59 See Annex A.4 of Brazil's 18 February 2004 Data Comments. 60 Brazil's 18 February 2004 Data Comments, para. 52 and note 75 thereto as well as Annex A.4, para. 40. While the missing soybean and peanut contract payments could be corrected for by excluding these crops from any allocations under the previous three methodologies, soybeans and peanuts are a firm part of the allocation calculations under the US Annex IV Methodology because they are part of the overall farm's revenue. They were included in Brazil's 18 February 2004 calculations based on the US 28 January 2004 summary data. Thus, it is only the payment data that remains missing from these calculations resulting in understating the amount of contract payments allocated to upland cotton.

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-839
32. As Brazil discussed in its 18 February 2004 Data Comments, Article 13(b)(ii) of the Agreement on Agriculture endorses no particular methodology. Thus, the Panel needs to choose a reasonable methodology for allocating contract payments as support to upland cotton.61 Brazil favours its methodology, based on an allocation pursuant to the acreage planted to contract payment crops, but also provides results under the Cotton-To-Cotton Methodology (similarly based on an acreage comparison), as well as two value-based methodologies.
33. However, Brazil strongly urges the Panel to apply an acreage-based methodology ­ preferably Brazil's Methodology. A particular flaw in a value-based methodology is that allocating countercyclical payments over the value of crop production means that allocations for a crop will decrease if prices for that crop fall.62 Thus, at the time when counter-cyclical payments are "critically needed"63 to offset low prices for a crop, a value-based methodology would allocate these counter-cyclical payments increasingly as support to other crops, whose prices have not fallen. Using a value-based allocation methodology shifts the share of counter-cyclical payments that are allocated to the crop with falling prices away from that crop and to crops with increasing or constant prices. By contrast, allocating contract payments over the acreage planted to contract payment crops ­ as done by the "Cotton-To-Cotton" Methodology and by Brazil's Methodology ­ provides an allocation approach that reflects the economic reality and intention behind the counter-cyclical payment support.
34. But Brazil emphasizes that, on the facts of this case, and using whichever methodology the Panel may ultimately choose, the US MY 1999-2002 support to upland cotton exceeds the MY 1992 level in each year and under each methodology (with the exception of the "Cotton-To-Cotton" and the US Annex IV Methodology in MY 2000).64
35. The following four tables present the peace clause comparisons for MY 1999-2002. The table below presents Brazil's peace clause comparison for MY 2002.
61 Brazil's 18 February 2004 Data Comments, paras. 33-42. 62 Suppose that a farm produces in two consecutive years the same amount of upland cotton and rice. The value of both crops is 50 in the first year leading to an allocation of half of the contract payments received by that farm. In the second year, prices for upland cotton fall to half their pervious level, while rice prices remain the same. Thus, the same amount of upland cotton is only worth 25 in the second year with the value of the rice crop remaining at 50. It follows that upland cotton receives a third of the contract payments allocations (its value is 25 out of a total crop value of 75) and rice receives two thirds of the contract payment allocations. The same principle would apply if rice prices had fallen by half with upland cotton remaining constant. In this case rice would receive an allocation of a third of the contract payments while upland cotton would receive two thirds of the contract payments allocations. In both cases the crop whose price is falling receives a smaller share of the support, contrary to the counter-cyclical (not pro-cyclical) approach of the payments involved. 63 Exhibit Bra 111, ("The Six Year World Outlook for Cotton and Peanuts: Implications for Production and Prices," Bob McLendon, National Cotton Council, p.1). 64 Brazil recalls that given the manner in which the United States presented its 3 March 2004 summary data, Brazil was prevented to provide an updated US Annex IV Methodology calculation based on the 3 March 2004 US summary data. See Section III, above. Further, neither of the two methodologies captures all support to upland cotton with the "Cotton-To-Cotton" Methodology not capturing any non-upland cotton contract payments that constitute support to upland cotton and the US-Proposed Annex IV Methodology suffering from various data problems, including the non-availability of data on soybean market loss assistance payments for that year.

In sum, the contract payment data provided by the United States on 3 March 2004 (as well as the data provided on 28 January 2004) demonstrates that the United States' support to upland cotton in MY 1999-2002 exceeds the support to upland cotton decided by the United States in MY 1992, within the meaning of Article 13(b)(ii) of the Agreement on Agriculture. The results using any allocation methodology applying any set of US summary data74 demonstrates their robustness.

ANNEX I-27

BRAZIL'S COMMENTS ON US 3 MARCH 2004 ANSWER TO QUESTION 264(B)
10 March 2004

264. (b)

Does the US agree with the statement in paragraph 135 of Brazil's 28 January 2004 comments on US responses to questions that the difference between the $1,148 billion in the chart at para. 165 of Brazil's 11 August answers to questions and the $666 million amount in Exhibit US-128 ($1.75 billion) closely corresponds to the total "Claims rescheduled" figure reported by the US in Exhibit US-128 (column F)?

Brazil's Comment:

1. The United States acknowledges, in paragraph 3 of its 3 March 2004 response, that the
difference referred to in the Panel's question arises because the United States treats the principal
amounts of rescheduled defaults as an immediate, 100 per cent recovery that is passed through as a
dollar-on-dollar reduction from the amount of claims outstanding in the year the terms of the rescheduling are agreed.1

2. In paragraph 1 of its response, the United States argues that the Brazilian conclusion included
in the Panel's question results from Brazil's comparison of fiscal year data provided by Brazil with
cohort-specific data provided by the United States. In fact, as explained at paragraph 34 of Brazil's 18 February 2004 Comments and illustrated in Exhibit Bra-431, Brazil reaches the same conclusion
with a comparison of 1993-2002 fiscal year data provided by Brazil with 1993-2002 fiscal year data provided by the United States.2

3. In paragraph 2 of its response, the United States asserts, citing undocumented "[a]ccounting research within the US Government," that "a significant portion" of principal collected on reschedulings "has not been reflected" in US budget line 88.40, tracked in column 2(a) of Exhibit Bra-431, despite the United States' acknowledgement that "[a]s a theoretical matter such `recovered principal' should be reflected in budget line 88.40". As the party asserting this fact, the United States bears the burden of proving it (particularly here, where it is addressing a line item from its own budget).3

1 For Brazil's views on this aspect of the US cash-basis accounting methodology for making an assessment under item (j), see Brazil's 18 February 2004 Comments, paras. 34-40; Brazil's 28 January 2004 Comments, paras. 134-137; Brazil's 11 August 2003 Answers, para. 162; Brazil's 22 July 2003 Oral Statement, para. 122.
2 Exhibit US-147 also lists (undocumented) data for fiscal years 1992, 2003 and 2004. Including the additional revenue and expense figures for these years does not change the fact that revenue for the CCC export credit guarantee programmes fails to cover the costs and losses of the programs. Exhibit US-147 alleges additional revenue of $38.5 million for 1992, $185.6 million for 2003, and $35.4 million for 2004; and additional costs and losses of $3 million for 1992, $130.1 million for 2003, and $22.8 million for 2004. Accounting for this data (($38.5 + $185.6 + $35.4) ­ ($3 + $130.1 + $22.8) = $103.6 million) would bring the total net costs and losses down from $1.083 billion, arrived at in Exhibit Bra-431, to $979.4 million.
3 See e.g. Appellate Body Report, Japan ­ Apples, WT/DS245/AB/R, para. 157 ("It is important to distinguish, on the one hand, the principle that the complainant must establish a prima facie case of inconsistency with a provision of a covered agreement from, on the other hand, the principle that the party that asserts a fact is responsible for providing proof thereof."). Moreover, Brazil again notes that the United States

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-844
4. Each and every figure used in Brazil's cash-basis accounting methodology for making an assessment under item (j) represents actual (as opposed to estimated) data from official US documents that Brazil has provided to the Panel.4 The United States has not even cited to any documentary support for the figures it has provided in Exhibit US-147 or US-148, let alone provided those documents for the Panel's review.
5. Thus, it is impossible for Brazil or the Panel to verify, for example, whether the CCC has, as the United States asserts at paragraph 2, recovered $205 million of the principal on its reschedulings. Moreover, this figure conflicts with other data provided by the United States. In column F of Exhibit US-147, the United States asserts that $1.64 billion of defaulted CCC guarantees have been rescheduled over the period 1992-2003; in Exhibit US-153, the United States asserts that the principal outstanding on these reschedulings amounts to $1.58 billion. Rather than recovering $205 million of the principal on its reschedulings, this data shows that the CCC has recovered only $60 million.
6. In any event, even if the Panel accepts the United States' unsupported assertion that the CCC has recovered $205 million of the principal on its reschedulings, this would not mean that premiums collected for the CCC export credit guarantee programmes meet the operating costs and losses of the programmes. Even if the entire $205 million figure is added to the "claims recovered" column of Brazil's cash-basis accounting calculation (column 2(a) of Exhibit Bra-341) ­ which by its own admission would be over-crediting the United States for recoveries of the principle on its reschedulings5 ­ the result is still that long-term operating costs and losses for the CCC export credit guarantee programmes outpace revenue (not just premiums collected, but all revenue) by $878 million.6
bears the burden, under Article 10.3 of the Agreement on Agriculture, of proving that quantities exported in excess of its reduction commitments have not benefited from export subsidies.
4 See chart included in paragraph 165 of Brazil's 11 August 2003 Answers (reproduced in paragraph 129 of Brazil's 28 January 2004 Comments).
5 In paragraph 2 of its response, the United States asserts that "a significant portion of" the principal recovered on its reschedulings is not included in line item 88.40 and column 2(a) of Exhibit Bra-341 ­ not that none of the principal recovered is included in that column.
6 Exhibit Bra-431 shows that the operating costs and losses outpace revenue by $1.083 billion. Deducting the $205 million cited by the United States yields a loss of $878 million by the CCC export credit guarantee programmes.

ANNEX I-28
COMMENTS OF THE UNITED STATES ON THE 10 MARCH 2004 COMMENTS OF BRAZIL ON THE US DATA SUBMITTED ON 3 MARCH 2004
(15 March 2004)
Introduction
1. The United States thanks the Panel for this opportunity to respond to the 10 March comments filed by Brazil1 relating to the data submitted by the United States on 3 March 2004, in response to the Panel's supplemental request for information. Brazil's 10 March comments consist primarily of a series of calculations using the US 3 March data in each of the methodologies previously explained by Brazil in its 18 February comments. The United States has previously explained, in filings on 11 February2 and 3 March3, that none of these methodologies is pertinent for purposes of the Peace Clause.4 Therefore, we will not repeat much of that analysis in these comments but rather will refer the Panel, as appropriate, to those previous comments by the United States.
2. Brazil states that, because the US 3 March data "is the best information available before the Panel," Brazil "no longer considers that relying on its `14/16th methodology would be appropriate.'"5 This means that, by Brazil's own statement, the only methodology that Brazil had brought forward from August 2003 until January 2004 to allegedly demonstrate a breach of the Peace Clause is irrelevant to this dispute. Moreover, it is difficult to reconcile Brazil's concession with its view that the Panel need only apply a "reasonable" methodology to calculate the support to upland cotton since Brazil alleges that the 14/16th methodology produces results that are similar to those under its other (flawed) methodologies.
3. Brazil's disavowal of its 14/16th methodology, however, does highlight the shifting nature of Brazil's Peace Clause arguments on decoupled payments. It may be of use to set out just how and how many times Brazil's theories have changed in this dispute.
4. First, Brazil argued that all payments for upland cotton base acres were "support to upland cotton." For example, in response to Question 41 from the Panel following the first session of the first substantive meeting, Brazil wrote:
"The only US domestic support measures that Brazil is aware of that would meet the test of being `support to upland cotton' are those that it listed for purposes of calculating the level of support in its First Written Submission. In the view of Brazil,

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-846
these non-green box domestic support measures are the measures that constitute `support to' upland cotton for the purpose of Article 13(b)."6
The decoupled measures listed in Brazil's first written submission (paragraphs 144, 148, and 149) were all production flexibility contract payments, market loss assistance payments, direct payments, and counter-cyclical payments for upland cotton base acres only. Thus, "in the view of Brazil" as of the first session of the first substantive meeting, only these payments were within the Panel's terms of reference.7
5. Second, in response to US criticisms, Brazil realized that, on its own terms, the theory that all payments for upland cotton base acres were "support to upland cotton" was not tenable. Brazil's theory ignored the fact that there were fewer acres planted to upland cotton than there were upland cotton base acres, suggesting that payment recipients utilized planting flexibility to plant other crops or nothing at all.
Thus, following the first session of the first panel meeting, Brazil introduced the socalled 14/16th methodology, which adjusted total expenditures for upland cotton base acres "by the ratio of upland cotton base acres actually planted." In Brazil's words, "only the portion of upland cotton [base] payments that actually benefits acres planted to upland cotton can be considered support to upland cotton."8
That is, Brazil amended its theory, arguing that all upland cotton was planted "on" upland cotton base acres.
6. Third, under Brazil's fallacious argument that receipt of decoupled payments was necessary for upland cotton producers to cover their costs, Brazil acknowledged that it was not "necessary" that upland cotton be planted on upland cotton base acres ­ that is, rice and peanuts base acreage also received payments that would allow these alleged costs to be covered. However, Brazil argued that the facts did not support the notion that upland cotton was "planted on" rice or peanuts base acreage.9 Rather, through the second session of the Panel's first substantive meeting (that is, after the Peace Clause phase of the dispute had concluded), Brazil continued to insist that "at a minimum a significant majority of upland cotton farmers in MY 2002 were farming on upland cotton base acres."10
7. Fourth, however, even Brazil's own evidence indicated that not all upland cotton was planted "on" upland cotton base acres. For example, as a result of pest eradication and adoption of biotechnology, significant acres in the US Southeast previously planted to peanuts, corn, and other crops were newly being planted to upland cotton.11 Thus, Brazil altered its theory again and argued that "Brazil's methodology assumes that US producers of upland cotton grew upland cotton on upland cotton base acreage," which is "a reasonable proxy, because there will be some upland cotton that is grown on rice (and peanut) base receiving higher payments, and some upland cotton that is grown on, e.g., corn base receiving somewhat lower payments. On average, Brazil's approach would roughly cancel out the over-counting of rice and peanut payments and the under-counting of corn and any other lower-paying programme crop payments."12

(footnote omitted). 12 Brazil's Answer to Question 125(8), para. 40 (27 October 2003).

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-847
8. Fifth, Brazil suggested in its further rebuttal submission of 18 November 2003, that "the United States has refused to generate information regarding how much and which of the contract payment base acreage was planted to upland cotton."13 However, Brazil nowhere explained how such an analysis of "how much and which of the contract payment base acreage was planted to upland cotton" could be done. In fact, Brazil suggested that the Panel should request the United States to produce information and that "Brazil would be pleased to provide the Panel with a precise list of parameters and questions that should be answered in any such analysis."14
9. Brazil, however, did not provide any such "precise list of parameters and questions" until the second panel meeting in December 2003. While Brazil requested certain information through its request in Exhibit BRA-369, Brazil did not explain to the Panel or the United States how it proposed to determine the amount of upland cotton acreage "planted on" base acreage for any particular commodity. Indeed, the Panel was compelled on 12 January 2004, to ask Brazil to "submit a detailed explanation of the method by which one could calculate total expenditures to producers of upland cotton under the four relevant programmes on the basis of the data which it seeks."15
10. Sixth, Brazil put forward on 20 January 2004, for the first time its allocation methodology ­ that is, after further rebuttal submissions had been filed and as the "serious prejudice" phase (and indeed the dispute settlement proceeding) was concluding. Here, Brazil set out its notion of underand over-planting of programme crop base acreage, which the United States has criticized and rebutted in a series of filings over the last month.
11. Seventh, however, Brazil did not stop there. On 28 January 2004, in its comments on the US 18 and 19 December 2003, data (the comments that were to have been filed on 20 January), Brazil set forth yet another in-the-alternative methodology, a purported application of that December data to the Subsidies Agreement Annex IV methodology.16
12. Eighth, Brazil put forward on 18 February 2004 ­ that is, in its last substantive filing in this dispute ­ two more in-the-alternative methodologies to calculate the alleged support to upland cotton from decoupled payments. First, it explained a cotton-to-cotton methodology17 under which only decoupled payments for upland cotton base acres would be deemed support to upland cotton. Second, it introduced a "modified (programme crop only) annex IV methodology"18 under which decoupled payments would be allocated only to programme crops in the proportions to which they contributed to the value of programme crop production on a farm.
13. Given this never-ending stream of theories of how and to what extent decoupled income support payments could be support to upland cotton, it would appear that Brazil has made any argument that suited its immediate needs to maximize the purported support to upland cotton. There can be no question that Brazil's incessant in-the-alternative argumentation has prejudiced the United States by significantly increasing the burden in evaluating and responding to Brazil's theories.
14. Brazil has argued that "[w]ithout farm-specific data, there [was] no basis to develop, let alone apply, Brazil's methodology. Brazil could only develop a methodology to apply to actual data when
13 Brazil's Further Rebuttal Submission, para. 50. 14 Brazil's Further Rebuttal Submission, para. 48 (italics added). 15 Panel Communication of January 12, 2004 (Question 258). 16 The United States has elsewhere explained that Brazil has not brought forward evidence and arguments to allow the Annex IV methodology to be applied for purposes of its subsidies claims. See, e.g., US 3 March Comments, paras. 29-35, 45-56. 17 Brazil's 18 February Comments, para. 46 ("Brazil first presents the results of using a slight variation of Brazil's methodology."). 18 Brazil's 18 February Comments, para. 50 ("Brazil also applied the revised US summary data to a modified `Annex IV' methodology allocating total contract payments to farms producing upland cotton over the value of contract payment crops produced on these farms.").

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-848
it received the EWG data in mid-November, and when it then sought farm-specific data from the United States."19 In this statement, however, Brazil concedes that it had not developed ­ because, allegedly, "there [was] no basis to develop" ­ its methodology until, at the earliest, midNovember 2003.
· It is simply incredible to read that a complaining party should have chosen to challenge payments which, on their face, are not product-specific support to upland cotton, yet not have developed a methodology to determine the amount of the payments it would consider "support to [that] specific commodity" until at least 6 months into the dispute.
· That is, it is rather startling that Brazil, as the complaining party, began this dispute without the evidence, or even the legal theory, necessary to sustain its assertions.
Further, we note that, even if Brazil had developed its methodology in mid-November, it did not choose to put this methodology forward until 20 January 2004 (eight months into this dispute), in response to the Panel's Question 258.
15. It is precisely this long delay in developing its Peace Clause arguments that led Brazil first to focus solely on payments for upland cotton base acres, and then only six months or more into the dispute to seek to bring in payments for non-upland cotton base acres. As the United States has argued, Brazil did not identify these payments that are not within the Panel's terms of reference20 and which, if included in this dispute, would prejudice US rights of defence.21 Furthermore, that Brazil had not crafted its methodology for Peace Clause purposes until six or eight months into this dispute undermines Brazil's Peace Clause interpretation: that is, Brazil has cast and recast its Peace Clause theories in order to find a theory that would result in US support exceeding the 1992 level. As the United States has demonstrated, however, non-product-specific support (whether green box or not) cannot be allocated as "support to a specific commodity" within the ordinary meaning of that phrase and as defined in Article 1(a) of the Agreement on Agriculture.22 Thus, there is no basis to allocated decoupled income support payments to upland cotton for purposes of Peace Clause. Brazil various theories also rely on a "budgetary outlays" approach, which, for all the reasons the United States has explained previously, is not found in the Peace Clause text and is the wrong approach for Peace Clause purposes.
Brazil's Attempt to Resurrect a Basis for the Use of Adverse Inferences Is Unsustainable
16. After stating that the US 3 March data "is the best information available before the Panel" and that "the United States appears to have provided complete summary base and complete summary planted data covering all crops for which data was requested by the Panel and all farms covered by the Panel's request,"23 Brazil nonetheless faults the United States for "certain problems" with the data and argues, in the alternative, that the alleged US "refusal" to provide certain data "would permit the Panel to draw the adverse inferences that this data ­ if produced ­ would have shown even higher payments being allocated to upland cotton."24 Brazil's effort to resuscitate its request for "adverse inferences" to be drawn is misguided. First, in its 13 February letter, Brazil stated that "by producing the complete aggregated information, there would no longer be a need to draw adverse inferences."25 As noted, Brazil has in its 10 March comments stated that the United States has produced "complete
19 Brazil's 18 February Comments, para. 84. 20 US 11 February Comments, paras. 47-50. 21 See US Comments on Brazil's Answer to Question 204 from the Panel, paras. 34-42 (28 January 2004). 22 See, e.g., US 3 March Comments, paras. 3-16. 23 Brazil's 10 March Comments, paras. 3-4 (italics added). 24 Brazil's 10 March Comments, para. 10 fn. 14. 25 Brazil 13 February 2004, Letter to the Panel, at 5.

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-849
summary base and complete summary planted data covering all crops for which data was requested by the Panel and all farms covered by the Panel's request." Therefore, Brazil has implicitly conceded that there is no basis to draw adverse inferences, and its suggestion otherwise is yet another in-thealternative argument that only serves to add needlessly to the complexity of this dispute.
17. This conclusion is confirmed by examining the data that the United States allegedly "refused" to provide. First, Brazil faults the United States for providing data with respect to farms that had upland cotton base acres but planted no upland cotton within Category A.26 We note that the Panel's supplementary request for information asked for information on farms with "fewer upland cotton planted acres than upland cotton base acres, or equal numbers of each,"27 which does not exclude farms with no planted acres from its ambit. Indeed, as Brazil points out, on 28 January 2004, and on 19 December 2003, the United States had provided planted and base acreage information relating to (1) farms that both planted upland cotton and had upland cotton base acres and (2) farms that did not plant upland cotton and had upland cotton base acres.28 It is not apparent from the text of item (b) of the Panel's supplementary request for information that the Panel was seeking the same information that had previously been provided. Because the United States provided the information requested under item (b) with respect to Category A farms, there is no basis for any adverse inference to be drawn.
18. Second, Brazil argues that the US 3 March data "does not provide contract payment yield or payment[] units." However, Brazil itself immediately concedes that "the Panel's 3 February 2004 Request does not ask for this information."29 Thus, as the payment yield information was not requested by the Panel, the United States could not have refused to provide it, and there is no basis for any adverse inference to be drawn.30
19. Third, Brazil states that "the United States did not produce any information that would allow the calculation of `producer-based' soybean market loss assistance [that is, "oilseed payments" for soybean producers31] and peanut direct and counter-cyclical payments received by producers operating upland cotton farms."32 However, Brazil does not contest that these payments were made to producers and that there were no base acres for these payments on any farms for the relevant years (soybeans in 1999 and 2000, peanuts in 2002). The United States recalls that the Panel's supplementary request for information related to "farms" with upland cotton base acres and/or upland cotton planted acres.33 Thus, the Panel's request did not ask for "payments received by producers
26 Given Brazil's repeated complaints in this dispute, it is ironic that Brazil now, in effect, complains that the United States has provided too much information.
27 Panel's Supplementary Request for Information, item (b) (3 February 2004). 28 Brazil's 10 March Comments, para. 6 & fn. 5. 29 Brazil's 10 March Comments, para. 7. 30 Brazil's comment that the United States should have provided information on payment units in "good faith" as it did in its data submissions of 18 and 19 December 2004, and 28 January 2004, fails to mention that Brazil's request for data specifically asked for contract yields to be provided. Exhibit BRA-369 (second paragraph, fourth bullet: requesting "payment yield for each programme crop") (3 December 2003). The United States has responded to all requests for data in this dispute in "good faith" by providing all the data (within the limits of US law) requested. 31 See, e.g., Response of the United States of America to the Panel's 3 February 2004, Data Request, As Clarified on 16 February 2004, paras. 10-13. 32 Brazil's 10 March Comments, para. 8. 33 See Panel's Supplementary Request for Information, item (b) (first solid bullet: "How many farms had fewer upland cotton planted acres than upland cotton base acres, or equal numbers of each? We refer to these as `Category A' farms."; second solid bullet: "How many farms had more upland cotton planted acres than upland cotton base acres? We refer to these as `Category B' farms."; third solid bullet: "How many farms had upland cotton planted acres but no upland cotton base acres? We refer to these as `Category C' farms.") (3 February 2004).

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-850
operating upland cotton farms," and there is no basis to draw an adverse inference from an alleged "failure" to provide information not requested.
20. In sum, Brazil's in-the-alternative renewed request concerning adverse inferences has no basis in fact; either the Panel's supplementary request for information did not request the information or the United States properly responded to the request as drafted. Furthermore, to the extent that Brazil argues that the contract payment yield data or soybeans or peanuts payments received by producers operating upland cotton farms were "necessary" for its Peace Clause analysis, this would demonstrate not that any adverse inference should be drawn but rather that Brazil, as the complaining party bearing the burden of proof, has failed to bring forth evidence to make a prima facie case.
Brazil's Allocation Methodologies Are Irrelevant for Peace Clause Purposes and, in any event, Continue to Suffer from Conceptual and Methodological Flaws
21. The United States has set forth in other comments the reasons that no allocation methodology may be employed for purposes of a Peace Clause analysis since the only relevant support is "support to a specific commodity" ­ that is, "assistance" or "backing" "specially pertaining to a particular" "agricultural crop" (in the ordinary meaning of the terms) or "support . . . provided for a basic agricultural product in favour of the producers of the basic agricultural product" (read in the context of the definition of product-specific support in Article 1(a) of the Agreement on Agriculture).34
22. Further, we have explained that for purposes of Brazil's serious prejudice claims, the Annex IV methodology35 would be necessary to identify the subsidy benefit and subsidized product for each of the challenged decoupled income support measures ­ and Brazil has not brought forward evidence and arguments to allow the Annex IV methodology to be used.36
23. Finally, we have previously presented comments on each of Brazil's allocation methodologies.37 As the calculations in Brazil's 10 March Comments are substantially similar to those it set out earlier, our comments on Brazil's new calculations are limited but also substantially similar to those we have previously provided. In particular, we note that Brazil has simply ignored the US criticisms of its pseudo-"Annex IV" methodology and excluded any sales from fruits and vegetables production, non-crop on-farm activities, and all other off-farm economic activity.
Cotton-to-Cotton Methodology
24. The United States has previously set out its criticism of this methodology, under which decoupled payments for upland cotton base acres on a farm that are equal to or less than the number of upland cotton planted acres are deemed to be support to upland cotton. Indeed, Brazil has never responded to the US explanation that "there are no physical `base acres' on a farm. Crop base acres are an accounting fiction that do not represent any particular acres on a farm."38 Thus, the very notion that base acres are "planted to" any particular crop (or, conversely, that a crop is "planted on" any particular base acre) is illusory.
25. We do note that the application of this erroneous methodology to the 3 March data does result in significant downwards revisions in the calculations Brazil previously presented, ranging from $58 million (MY2001 PFC) to $122 million (MY2002 CCP).39

Brazil's Methodology
26. Again, the United States has previously set out at length its criticisms of Brazil's methodology. The inconsistencies and logical flaws in this methodology are striking and demonstrate the post hoc nature of Brazil's attempt to force an allocation methodology onto decoupled payments. For example:
· There is no physical or economic basis to consider that decoupled payments for base acres of a crop are support to current production of that crop or to other (underplanted) programme crops. Base acres are not physical acres and are not "planted to" anything. A decoupled income support recipient may produce no, one, or multiple products; since money is fungible, those payments in economic terms (but not for purposes of Peace Clause) may be attributed to all (if any) of the recipient's sales.
· Brazil has never examined whether decoupled payments for non-upland cotton base acres "support or maintain" the production of those non-upland cotton programme crops ­ and thus has demonstrated no basis (on its own theory) for allocating such payments to those crops first.
· Brazil argues that base acres are "planted to" a particular commodity, one-for-one, but has no explanation for how an upland cotton planted acre can also be deemed to be "planted on" multiple base acres at once, as occurs when "underplanted" base acres are totalled and allocated proportionally to all "excess" planted acres (including cotton).40
· Brazil has never provided any logical explanation for why decoupled income support payments would be attributed to programme crops but not to other crops or other on-farm or off-farm economic activities (as economics and the Annex IV methodology would suggest is necessary).
· Neither has Brazil attempted to apply its own rationale that decoupled payments are "support to a specific commodity" when such payments "cover (or contribute to) the costs of production" of that commodity41 to any other product produced by payment recipients, thus invalidating its own methodology, under which payments for base acreage is first support to the crop to which the acreage corresponds and then to other programme crops. Using Brazil's own "cost of production" principle, there is no basis to assert that order of analysis since Brazil has presented no evidence that such payments "cover (or contribute to) the costs of production" of those commodities but not others.
The United States has explored at some length these and other logical inconsistencies in Brazil's purported methodology for allocating decoupled payments to particular commodities. Although there is no basis in the Peace Clause to allocate non-product-specific support as support to a specific
40 For example, in Exhibit BRA-433, Brazil presents calculations for allocating payments under its methodology for the different categories of farms set out in the Panel's supplementary request for information. For marketing year 2002, Category B2 farms planted 2,703,663 acres of cotton and had 2,035,335 base acres of cotton. Thus, Brazil calculates that there were 668,329 overplanted cotton acres eligible for allocated payments. Base acreage for other programme crops for Category B2 farms exceeded planted acreage for those crops by 1,197,785 acres, and no other programme crop was planted in excess of its base acreage. Thus, Brazil allocated the total payments "free to be allocated" ($21,290,090) from the non-upland cotton base acreage entirely to upland cotton. This means that the 668,329 overplanted cotton acres were "planted on" 1,197,785 "excess" base acres for other programme crops, or each "excess" acre of cotton was "planted on" 1.79 non-upland cotton base acres.
41 Brazil's 18 February Comments, para. 3.

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-852
commodity, we nonetheless invite the Panel to consider these reasons why Brazil's methodology cannot serve as a neutral means to allocate decoupled payments.42
27. We also pause to recall that one of Brazil's primary responses to the US criticism that its methodology would result in different subsidization rates for upland cotton on a single farm and would result in the allocation of multiple non-upland cotton base acres per cotton planted acre was that "both of these alleged problems . . . do not exist from MY 2002. This is because Brazil's methodology allocates for each planted acre[] of upland cotton only one upland cotton base acre." Brazil then went on to suggest that because in MY 2002 greater than 99 per cent of direct and countercyclical payments received by upland cotton producers were for upland cotton base acres and because upland cotton base exceeded upland cotton planted acreage, "the two main US criticisms affect . . . at most, 0.9 per cent of the payments at issue for MY 2002."43
28. However, Brazil's 10 March comments tell quite a different story. There, Brazil calculates "the amount of upland cotton planted acres for which there exists a corresponding upland cotton base acre [by] farm category."44 The percentage of upland cotton planted acreage for which an upland cotton base acre exists is 72.87 per cent in marketing year 1999, 70.03 per cent in marketing year 2000, 68.06 per cent in marketing year 2001, and 84.33 per cent in marketing year 2002.
· That is, in any given year, approximately 15 to 22 per cent of upland cotton planted acres ­ between 2.1 million and 4.9 million acres ­ were allocated payments for non-upland cotton base acres and would be subject to the US criticisms dismissed by Brazil as de minimis. Brazil simply ignores this issue in its 10 March comments.
Furthermore, we recall that Brazil stated that "[a]s for some of the US criticisms that might affect the results (except for MY2002), Brazil will control for these effects once the United States provides aggregate data in the manner requested by the Panel."45 The United States is not aware of any explicit recognition by Brazil of "US criticisms that might affect the results" nor any effort by Brazil in its 10 March comments to "control for these effects."
29. Finally, we note that the application of Brazil's erroneous methodology to the 3 March data again results in significant downwards revisions in the calculations Brazil previously presented, ranging from approximately $43 million (MY2001 PFC) to $120 million (MY2002 CCP).46
Modified US Annex IV methodology
30. Brazil presents largely unchanged "modified Annex IV" calculations, for example, excluding both soybeans (marketing years 1999 and 2000) and peanuts (marketing year 2002) as a programme crop.47 Under this "modified Annex IV" methodology, Brazil allocated total contract payments to
42 See US 3 March Comments, paras. 37-44; US 11 February Comments, paras. 35-43; US Comments to Brazil's Answer to Question 258 from the Panel, paras. 207-29 (28 January 2004).
43 Brazil's 18 February Comments, para. 60. 44 Brazil's 10 March Comments, para. 20. 45 Brazil's 18 February Comments, para. 67. 46 Compare Brazil's 10 March Comments, para. 19 with Brazil's 18 February Comments, para. 49. 47 We note that the rice prices used by Brazil in its calculations in Exhibit BRA-434 are incorrect. Brazil has mistakenly divided the average rice farm price, reported in dollars per hundredweight (i.e., 100 pounds), by 220.46 instead of by 100 to obtain a price expressed in dollars per pound.

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-853

upland cotton "according to the share of upland cotton crop value of the total value of contract payment crop production."48 Thus, the US view of this "modified" methodology remains unchanged: Brazil's approach is fundamentally inconsistent with Annex IV, paragraph 2, under which the subsidy is allocated over "the total value of the recipient firm's sales." Furthermore, there is no plausible basis to maintain that decoupled income support payments are support only to contract payment crops. Brazil also improperly includes the total value of contract payments in its calculation when only payments for upland cotton base acres are within the scope of this dispute.
"US Annex IV Methodology"
31. Brazil offers no new analysis in its 10 March comments but just repeats the calculations presented in its 18 February filing. Thus, Brazil's "US Annex IV methodology" does not reflect the "US" interpretation of Annex IV, which is based on the text of Annex IV. That text establishes that, if a payment is not "tied to the production or sale of a given product," the subsidized product is all of the recipient firm's sales, and the subsidy for any one product is that product's share of "the total value of the recipient firm's sales."49 Brazil does not use "the total value of the recipient firm's sales" in its "US Annex IV calculation" and does not even attempt to calculate total sales of upland cotton producers.
32. Because Brazil reiterates its 18 February calculations, Brazil's 10 March calculations are similarly flawed. First, Brazil errs by omitting the value of fruits and vegetables in calculating the total value of non-programme crop production. As the US 3 3 March data shows, in marketing year 2002 alone, 1.2 million acres were planted to fruits and vegetables on farms that reported cotton base acreage.50 As pointed out in the US comments of 11 February,51 excluding fruits and vegetables biases significantly downward the value of non-programme crop acreage. For example, the United States estimated the per-acre value of non-programme crops including fruits and vegetables was estimated at $28152 for 2002 ­ that is, 138 per cent higher than the $118 per acre Brazil calculated when fruits and vegetables are excluded.53
33. Brazil suggests that it was not able to make any adjustment to its calculations because of its inability to separate those farms with no planted acres of cotton from Category A. However, Brazil does not explain why it was unable to use the actual planted acreage data, including that for fruits and vegetables, for Category B farms.54 Nor does Brazil explain why it was unable to use the state-bystate information on plantings to make any adjustment to its use of "the average per-acre value of production of non-programme crops in that marketing year in the entire United States."55

the scope of this dispute. To the extent Brazil disagrees, however, the same criticism of Brazil's failure to use
the actual planted acreage data applies. 55 Brazil's 28 January Data Comments, para. 90 (italics added).

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-854
34. Further, Brazil has not taken any account of the value of on-farm production other than crops, and has presented no data that would allow that calculation to be made. Again, the 1997 ARMS cotton costs of production survey suggested that, had Brazil taken into account the value of non-crop on-farm production, the share of cotton as a per cent of total farm sales would be lower still. For 1997, when the value of cotton was high, the 1997 ARMS cotton costs of production survey reported that cotton accounted for only 44.5 per cent of the total value of agricultural production on cotton farms.56
35. Brazil also fails to include off-farm economic activity, which can be substantial, in its calculation. Annex IV, paragraph 2, establishes that the non-tied subsidy is allocated over "the total value of the recipient firm's sales," not merely its farm sales. As we have previously noted, cotton operations earn almost 30 per cent of income from off-farm sources.57
36. Finally, Brazil continues not to make any adjustment for the fact that landowners capture the subsidy benefit of payments on rented acres. As the United States has noted, Brazil has previously conceded that, as of marketing year 1997, 34 to 41 cents per dollar of production flexibility contract payments were capitalized into land rent.58 Furthermore, certain missing pages from Exhibit BRA276 report that, during 1998-2000, the capture by landowners through increased rent of production flexibility contract payments increased to an estimated average of 81 to 83 per cent.59 Thus, Brazil's own evidence does not support its decision not to adjust the subsidy benefit to upland cotton producers downwards to reflect the two-thirds of cotton acres that are rented by producers, not owned.
Conclusion: Brazil Can Only Prevail on the Peace Clause Under an Incorrect Interpretation of the Peace Clause
37. The United States has demonstrated that Brazil's reading of the Peace Clause is not tenable; instead, Brazil invents the concept that non-product-specific support must be allocated to specific commodities. This concept runs directly contrary to the ordinary meaning of the Peace Clause text and directly contrary to its context, including the fundamental separation of product-specific and nonproduct-specific support in the Agreement on Agriculture.
38. The United States has also demonstrated that Brazil's approach to its "serious prejudice" claims is misguided. As mentioned previously, Brazil's notion that "the effect of the subsidy" may be analyzed without knowing the amount of the challenged subsidy is akin to saying that "the effect of eating" may be determined without knowing how much is being eaten.60 Of course, to determine "the effect of eating" one must also determine "what" is being eaten (in addition to "how much"); similarly, "the effect of the subsidy" will depend on the nature of the challenged subsidy.61 Thus, the United States believes that Brazil has failed to make a prima facie case with respect to decoupled income support payments (direct and counter-cyclical payments)62 under its serious prejudice claims because it has not identified either the subsidy benefit or the subsidized product(s) using the Annex IV
56 US 3 March Comments, para. 50; US 11 February Comments, para. 55. 57 See US 3 March Comments, para. 51. 58 Brazil's Answer to Question 179 from the Panel, para. 165 (27 October 2003); Brazil's Opening Statement at the Second Panel Meeting, para. 57. 59 US 3 March Comments, paras. 52-54; Exhibit US-155, at 106. 60 US 3 March Comments, para. 30 fn. 59. 61 See Subsidies Agreement, Article 7.2 (request for consultations under Article 7.1 "shall include a statement of available evidence with regard to (a) the existence and nature of the subsidy in question") (italics added). 62 Only direct and counter-cyclical payments were measures in existence at the time the Panel was established during marketing year 2002. Both production flexibility contract payments and market loss assistance payments were recurring subsidies paid with respect to past production that had terminated by the time of the panel request and panel establishment.

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-855
methodology. In addition, Brazil has failed to establish that the effect of these challenged payments is "serious prejudice"; to the contrary, the United States has demonstrated that the effect of these decoupled measures is no more than minimal.63
39. Finally, the United States has demonstrated that using any measurement that reflects the support "decided" by the United States ­ rather than factors (such as market prices) beyond the United States' control ­ US support to upland cotton in marketing years 1999-2002 has not exceeded the 1992 marketing year level.64 Brazil's proposed approach suffers from the key flaws (among others) that it relies on the argument that:
(1) budgetary outlays must be used, despite the fact that the United States never "decided" an expenditure level (a point confirmed by Brazil's own reliance on the marketing loan rate and counter-cyclical target price for purposes of its per se and threat of serious prejudice claims65); and
(2) decoupled income support measures ­ the green box direct payments and the nonproduct-specific counter-cyclical payments66 ­ can and must be allocated as "support to a specific commodity," despite the ordinary meaning of those terms in their context in the Agreement on Agriculture.
40. That both of these conditions must be met is evident if one examines the four tables setting out Brazil's Peace Clause comparisons.67
· For example, even using budgetary outlays, if decoupled income support payments are removed from Brazil's Peace Clause comparisons, US measures did not breach the Peace Clause in marketing years 2002 and 2000. The 1992 support would be $2,117.0 million, and the 2002 and 2000 levels would be $1,557.1 million and $1,218.7 million, respectively.68
· On the other hand, even if decoupled income support measures were allocated according to any of Brazil's four erroneous methodologies, US measures did not breach the Peace Clause in marketing year 2001 if a price-gap calculation is used in place of outlays for marketing loan payments. A price-gap calculation eliminates the effect of market prices on the support
63 See, e.g., US Comments on Brazil's Comments on US Comments Concerning Brazil's Econometric Model, paras. 4-9 (28 January 2004).
64 See, e.g., US 11 February Comments, paras. 15-17. 65 See Brazil's Further Submission, para. 432 ("The existence of the 72.4 cents per pound support price under the 2002 FSRI Act alone causes production-enhancing and price-suppressing effects. The single fact that these programmes exist ensures a guaranteed revenue amount from the production of upland cotton. This revenue floor is a guaranteed entitlement. That guaranteed revenue floor has the effect of removing any uncertainty and risk about the revenue farmers will receive for the crop. It means that regardless of the actual price development during the marketing year, a farmer knows that he or she will receive at the very least the loan rate for their product, plus price-triggered revenue support granted by the CCP programme."). 66 Were the Panel to examine the terminated payments prior to the 2002 Farm Act, production flexibility contract payments would be green box, and the market loss assistance payments would be nonproduct-specific, as notified to the WTO. 67 Brazil's 10 March Comments, paras. 35-38. 68 See Brazil's 10 March Comments, paras. 35, 37. This calculation ignores the inappropriate inclusion of crop insurance payments (non-product-specific), cottonseed payments (not in existence at time of panel establishment), and "other payments" (not identified in Panel request). We also note that the marketing year 1999 budgetary outlay level would be $2,431.6 million if decoupled support is excluded. Brazil has alleged that some portion of Step 2 payments are prohibited export subsidies, rather than domestic support, and the United States has argued that "other payments" are not within the Panel's terms of reference. The Panel's view of these issues could result in the 1999 budgetary outlay level too being below the 1992 level.

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-856
provided.69 US measures conform to the Peace Clause in marketing year 2001 under two different Brazilian allocation methodologies if a price-gap calculation is used.70
· Indeed, even without making any changes to Brazil's data, under two of its current "reasonable" methodologies, US measures did not breach the Peace Clause in 2000, the year with the highest market prices and therefore the lowest marketing loan payments.71
41. The United States believes that a proper interpretation and application of the Peace Clause must reflect the way in which the United States "decided" support in marketing years 1992 and 200272 ­ and, in the case of US measures, the support to upland cotton as "decided" was a rate of support. However, the United States has demonstrated that even an AMS calculation that reflects the support decided by the United States rather than market prices beyond our control would also demonstrate that US measures conform to the Peace Clause. Brazil's revised budgetary outlay calculations also support this view.
· If neither condition set out above is met ­ that is, decoupled income support measures are properly excluded from the Peace Clause analysis and price-based marketing loan payments are calculated using a price-gap methodology ­ US measures did not breach the Peace Clause in any marketing year between 1999 and 2002.
· Support in marketing year 1992 would be $1,384 million,73 well above the revised support levels are $659.1 million for marketing year 2002, $458.9 million for marketing year 2001, $582.7 million for marketing year 2000, and $670.6 million for marketing year 1999.74
· Again, these lower levels of support "decided" in recent years reflects the United States' decision after the Uruguay Round to move away from the product-specific deficiency payments with high target prices and instead to supplement producer income with a mix of decoupled income supports that are green box (direct payments) or non-product-specific (counter-cyclical payments).
69 See US Rebuttal Submission, paras. 114-17. By holding the external reference price fixed, support measured using a price-gap calculation shows the effect of changes in the level of support (the applied administered price) decided by the United States, rather than changes in outlays that may result from forces beyond our control, such as market prices.
70 For marketing year 2001, support measured using a price-gap calculation for price-based measures and budgetary expenditures for other payments results in $1,251 million. For methodologies (1) ("cotton-tocotton") and (4) ("US Annex IV methodology"), support was $1,240.9 million and $1,183.8 million. Again, these calculations do not remove crop insurance payments (non-product-specific), any portion of "Step 2" payments, or "other payments" (not within the scope of the dispute).
71 Brazil's 10 March Comments, para. 37 (1992 budgetary outlays were $2,117.0 million; 2000 outlays under the cotton-to-cotton methodology were $2,068.8 million; 2000 outlays under the "US Annex IV Methodology" were $2,112.6 million).
72 The measures (subsidies) provided with respect to marketing years 1999-2001 were no longer in existence at the time of Brazil's panel request and panel establishment. To the extent the Panel were to examine these measures, however, the same analysis would apply.
73 This figure uses the same $1,017.4 expenditure amount that Brazil used for deficiency payments. This figure is not markedly different from the $1,009 price-gap figure calculated by the United States using eligible acreage, but even if actual payment acreage were used, the price-gap payment total would be $867 million. US Comments on New Material in Brazil's Rebuttal Filings, para. 8 (27 August 2003). Thus, the 1992 level of support would still be higher than in marketing years 1999-2002.
74 These revised figures exclude decoupled payments and use the price-gap calculation for marketing loan payments, which results in a zero level of support since the marketing loan rate was below the fixed reference price. See US Rebuttal Submission, para. 117 & fn. 148 (22 August 2003). However, these revised figures do not even remove crop insurance payments (non-product-specific), any portion of "Step 2" payments (which Brazil alleges are, in part, prohibited export subsidies), or "other payments" (not within the scope of the dispute).

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-857
42. Were the Panel to reach the question of serious prejudice or threat thereof, the United States has demonstrated that Brazil has not made a prima facie case that the challenged US measures have had that effect. However, the Panel should not even reach that question as the facts demonstrate that the United States has disciplined itself to grant support not in excess of that decided during the 1992 marketing year. Brazil must argue that non-product-specific support can be allocated as support to a specific commodity and must argue that support "decided" means budgetary outlays because without those conditions, it cannot demonstrate a Peace Clause breach. The United States has demonstrated, however, that Brazil's approach is legally unsound and internally inconsistent. It would, moreover, provide no certainty for Members who seek to conform to their WTO obligations. Brazil's constantly shifting methodologies reflect its desire to find an approach to maximize the dollars it could argue are support to upland cotton but do not reflect the legal texts, structure, and concepts found in the Agreement on Agriculture and the Subsidies Agreement.
