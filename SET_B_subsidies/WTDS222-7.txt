CANADA ­ EXPORT CREDITS AND LOAN GUARANTEES FOR REGIONAL AIRCRAFT
Recourse by Brazil to Article 4.10 of the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures and Article 22.2 of the Understanding
on Rules and Procedures Governing the Settlement of Disputes
The following communication, dated 23 May 2002, from the Permanent Mission of Brazil to the Chairman of the Dispute Settlement Body, is circulated pursuant to Article 4.10 of the SCM Agreement and Article 22.2 of the DSU.
_______________
The Panel in the dispute Canada ­ Export Credits and Loan Guarantees for Regional Aircraft found that a number of transactions concerning Canadian exports of regional aircraft were inconsistent with Article 3.1(a) of the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures (the "SCM Agreement"). The report of that Panel (WT/DS222/R) was adopted by the Dispute Settlement Body (the "DSB") on 19 February 2002. The corresponding DSB recommendations established that Canada had to withdraw the identified prohibited subsidies "without delay". The DSB also determined that such withdrawal had to take place within 90 days.
In the DSB meeting held on 8 March 2002, in the agenda item "Canada - Export Credits and Loan Guarantees for Regional Aircraft, (a) Implementation of the recommendations of the DSB", the Canadian delegation merely indicated that Canada was "considering its options on how best to proceed with respect to this matter".
The 90-day period granted by the DSB for the withdrawal of the subsidies expired on 20 May 2002. In the DSB meeting held on 22 May 2002, Canada informed WTO Members that it had not taken action and would not be taking action with regard to any of the transactions found to be inconsistent with its obligations under the SCM Agreement.
Brazil therefore concludes that Canada has not followed the recommendation of the DSB within the time-period specified by the panel, as required by Article 4.10 of the SCM Agreement.
Accordingly, pursuant to Article 22.2(a) of the Understanding on Rules and Procedures Governing the Settlement of Disputes (the "DSU") and Article 4.10 of the SCM Agreement, Brazil hereby requests that the DSB, in its special meeting of 3 June 2002, grant Brazil authorization to take appropriate countermeasures in the amount of US$ 3.36 billion.
Brazil intends to implement this authorization to take appropriate countermeasures in the form of some or all of the following:

(1) suspension of the application of the obligation under paragraph 6(a) of Article VI of GATT 1994 to determine that the effect of subsidization under EDC Canada Account and EDC Corporate Account programmes is to cause or threaten material injury to an established domestic industry, or is to retard materially the establishment of a domestic industry;
(2) suspension of the application of obligations under the Agreement on Import Licensing Procedures relative to licensing requirements on imports from Canada; and
(3) suspension of tariff concessions and related obligations under the GATT 1994 concerning a list of products to be drawn from the list attached to this request.
