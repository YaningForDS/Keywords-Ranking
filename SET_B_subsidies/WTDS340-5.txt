_______________
My authorities have instructed me to request, pursuant to Article 4.11 of the WTO Understanding on Rules and Procedures Governing the Settlement of Disputes, that Mexico be joined in the consultations requested by the United States on 30 March 2006 in a communication circulated to Members on 3 April 2006 which identifies as the subject of the requested consultations "China's treatment of motor vehicle parts, components, and accessories ("auto parts") imported from the United States."
As a producer of automobile parts, Mexico has a substantial trade interest in this case, and would be most grateful if its request were given due consideration.
