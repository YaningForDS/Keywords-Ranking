Communication from the United States and Indonesia
The following communication, dated 7 August 1998, from the Permanent Missions of Indonesia and the United States, addressed to the Chairman of the Dispute Settlement Body, is circulated pursuant to Article 21.3 of the DSU.
_______________
This letter is sent to you on behalf of the Governments of the Republic of Indonesia and the United States of America and related to the matters of "Indonesia ­ Certain Measures Affecting the Automobile Industry" (WT/DS54). We take note that on 23 July 1998, the Dispute Settlement Body (DSB) adopted the panel report in the above-referenced dispute. We agree that instead of making its statement at a meeting of the DSB as anticipated by Article 21.3 of the DSU, Indonesia will inform the DSB by 21 August 1998 of its intentions in respect of implementation of the DSB's 23 July 1998 rulings and recommendations. Indonesia and the United States agree that their respective rights and obligations are preserved through this approach, as if a meeting under Article 21.3 of the DSU had been held.
