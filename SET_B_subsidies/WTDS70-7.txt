CANADA ­ MEASURES AFFECTING THE EXPORT OF CIVILIAN AIRCRAFT
Communication from Canada
The following communication, dated 6 September 1999, from the Permanent Mission of Canada to the Dispute Settlement Body is circulated at the request of Canada.
_______________
Pursuant to Article 21.3 of the Understanding on Rules and Procedures Governing the Settlement of Disputes, I am pleased to inform the Dispute Settlement Body of Canada's intentions in respect of implementation of the recommendations and rulings of the Dispute Settlement Body in the matter of "Canada ­ Measures Affecting the Export of Civilian Aircraft".
Canada intends to implement fully and faithfully the Dispute Settlement Body's rulings with respect to the two programmes - the Canada Account and the Technology Partnerships Canada ­ that were found to constitute prohibited export subsidies as applied to the Canadian regional aircraft industry. Details of Canada's implementation program will be forthcoming and we look forward to collaborating closely with Brazilian authorities at an early date on our respective implementation plans. Canada will keep the Dispute Settlement Body informed as is required.
