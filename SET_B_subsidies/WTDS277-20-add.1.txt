Notification of Mutually Agreed Solution

Dear Mr. Chairman:
The Governments of the United States of America and Canada hereby wish to notify the Dispute Settlement Body ("DSB") that, in accordance with Article 3.6 of the Understanding on Rules and Procedures Governing the Settlement of Disputes, we have reached a mutually agreed solution to the matters raised by Canada in the above-referenced disputes. This solution has taken the form of a comprehensive agreement between the United States and Canada, dated 12 September 2006, resolving all disputes related to trade in softwood lumber between our two countries (the "Softwood Lumber Agreement"). A copy of the Softwood Lumber Agreement is attached.
In light of the foregoing, Canada hereby withdraws its requests (WT/DS257/16; WT/DS264/17; WT/DS277/9) to the DSB pursuant to Article 22.2 of the DSU for authorization to suspend the application to the United States of tariff concessions or other obligations under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994 ("GATT 1994"). Canada having withdrawn its requests under Article 22.2 of the DSU, the United States hereby withdraws its requests (WT/DS257/17; WT/DS264/19; WT/DS277/10) to the DSB for arbitration under Article 22.6 of the

This mutually agreed solution is without prejudice to the WTO rights and obligations of the United States and Canada except with respect to the disputes listed above.
We ask that you circulate this notification to the relevant Councils and Committees, as well as to the Dispute Settlement Body.
