The following communication, received on 28 April 2006, from the delegation of Mexico to the delegation of China, the delegation of Canada and to the Chairman of the Dispute Settlement Body, is circulated in accordance with Article 4.11 of the DSU.
_______________
My authorities have instructed me to request, pursuant to Article 4.11 of the WTO Understanding on Rules and Procedures Governing the Settlement of Disputes, that Mexico be joined in the consultations requested by Canada on 13 April 2006 in a communication circulated to Members on 19 April 2006 which identifies the subject of the requested consultations as "China's treatment of automobile parts from Canada."
As a producer of automobile parts, Mexico has a substantial trade interest in this case, and would be most grateful if its request were given due consideration.
