Pursuant to Article 4.11 of the Understanding on Rules and Procedures Governing the Settlement of Disputes, the European Union hereby notifies the Government of the People's Republic of China ("China"), the Government of the United States and the Dispute Settlement Body that, in the light of the substantial trade interest of the European Union, it desires to be joined in the consultations requested by the United States in a communication circulated to WTO Members on 6 January 2011 (WT/DS419/1, G/L/950, G/SCM/D86/1) entitled "China ­ Measures Concerning Wind Power Equipment.

The European Union thus has a substantial trade interest in the present dispute.
