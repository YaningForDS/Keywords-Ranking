UNITED STATES ­ SUBSIDIES ON UPLAND COTTON
Questions from the Panel to the parties ­ second substantive Panel meeting
I. Terms of Reference
192. Regarding the interest subsidies and storage payments listed by the United States in its response to the Panel's Question No. 67:
(a) Please provide a copy of the regulations under which they are currently provided and under which they were provided during the marketing years 19962002;
(b) Please indicate whether there are any such payments which are not provided to implement the repayment rate for upland cotton within the marketing loan programme. USA
193. Are interest subsidies and storage payments already included in the amounts shown in your submissions to date for payments under the marketing loan programme? Has there been any double-counting? BRA
Brazil's Answer:
1. The answer to both questions is "no." Brazil reported interest subsidies and storage payments separately and thus did not double count them.1 To the extent that the United States confirms that both of these payments are connected in some way to the storage of bales of cotton involved in the marketing loan programme, then they would appropriately be included within the overall marketing loan numbers. In that case, the Panel should increase the amount of payments attributable to marketing loan payments by including interest and storage payments related to bales of cotton in the marketing loan programme.
194. Does the United States maintain its position stated in response to the Panel's Question No. 67 that "it would not be appropriate for the Panel to examine payments made after the date of panel establishment"? If so, please explain why. Can Brazil comment on this statement? BRA, USA
Brazil's Answer:
2. Brazil reserves its right to further comment on the US answer provides some initial thoughts.
3. Brazil reiterates its arguments that the Panel must examine data relating to payments made after the date of establishment.2 In addition, the Panel is not prevented from examining payment data that originates after the date of the Panel's establishment because these payments are identified in Brazil's panel request and, therefore, are within the Panel's terms of reference.
4. The measures covered by Brazil's request for the establishment of the Panel are very broad and encompass, inter alia, any type of payment made under the 2002 FSRI Act and the 2000 ARP Act.3 In addition, the panel request covers, inter alia, a time period of a "marketing year" for 2002 for
1 See e.g. Brazil's 9 September Further Submission, Table 1. 2 Brazil's 22 August Rebuttal Submission, paras. 88-96; Brazil's 22 July Oral Statement, paras. 40-44. 3 WT/DS267/7, p. 2.

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-279
upland cotton for the period 1 August 2002 through 31 July 2003. The panel request further covers 2002 FSRI Act and 2000 ARP Act payments to be made during marketing years MY 2003-2007. In addition, the identified measures guarantee the right of eligible US producers, users and exporters to receive future payments.4 Given the comprehensive scope and timing coverage of the request for the establishment of a Panel and the mandatory nature of the payments,5 the Panel's terms of reference encompass all payments made under the 2002 FSRI Act for the period marketing year 2002.
5. As has been firmly established in WTO jurisprudence, any "measure" identified in the panel request pursuant to DSU Article 6.2, is within terms of reference of the panel.6 As noted above, Brazil identified all relevant "measures" in its request for the establishment in the Panel. Further, in the Chile ­ Agricultural Products (Price Band) case, the Appellate Body held that a panel request which includes reference to "amendments" is sufficient to bring later enacted significant changes to legislation within the Panel's terms of reference.7 While Brazil's panel request also included "amendments," this case does not even raise the Chile ­ Agricultural Products (Price Band) issues because Brazil's panel request identified the measures that have not changed or been amended since 18 March 2003. Further, to the extent that "payments" made since 18 March 2003 are evidence, the Appellate Body and panels have repeatedly found that evidence generated after the establishment of the panel can be used by panel's in their objective assessment of the facts under DSU Article 11.8
II. Economic Data
195. Does the United States wish to revise its response to the Panel's Question No. 67bis, in particular, its statement that "the United States ... does not maintain information on the amount of expenditures made under the cited programmes to US upland cotton producers"? Did the United States make enquiries of the FSA in the course of preparing its original answer? USA
196. Please provide the latest data for the 2002 marketing year on payments under the marketing loan, direct payments, counter-cyclical payments, user marketing certificate (step 2) programmes and export credit guarantee programmes. BRA, USA
Brazil's Answer:
6. With its letter of 18 December 2003, the United States has finally confirmed ­ after asserting the contrary repeatedly to Brazil and then to the Panel ­ that it has collected complete planted acreage, contract base acreage, contract yields, and even payment data that would allow it to calculate with relative precision the amount of direct and counter-cyclical payments made to current producers of

To the extent that such information is relevant to our determination of the consistency of India's balance of payments measures with GATT rules as of the date of establishment of the Panel [18 November 1997], we take it into account."); Appellate Body Report, EC ­ Hormones, WT/DS26/AB/R, paras. 133-4 ("The deliberate disregard of, or refusal to consider, the evidence submitted to a panel is incompatible with the panel's duty to make an objective assessment of the facts. ... A claim that a panel disregarded or distorted the evidence submitted to it is, in effect, a claim that the panel, to a greater or lesser degree, denied the party submitting the evidence fundamental fairness, or what in many jurisdictions is known as due process of law or natural justice."); Panel Report, Japan ­ Apples, WT/DS245/R, para. 8.49; GATT Panel Report, Korea ­ Beef, BISD 36S/268, paras. 122-123.

upland cotton in MY 2002. Therefore, Brazil looks forward to the United States answering this question in full on 22 December.
7. Unfortunately, Brazil cannot calculate direct payment and counter-cyclical payment figures because the United States refused to produce on 18 December the information requested by Brazil and the Panel. In particular, the United States refused to provide farm-specific identifying numbers, thus rendering any matching of farm-level information on contract payments with information on farmspecific plantings impossible. Only this unique farm number (or a substitute number protecting the alleged confidentiality of farmers) would allow any matching of planting and payment data critical for the calculation of the amount of contract payments that constitute support to upland cotton.9 The United States asserts newfound "confidentiality" concerns even though it provided identical information on rice to a private US citizen making a simple FOIA request. But even these confidentiality concerns could not possibly apply to aggregate matched figures that the United States could easily calculate with the data the United States admits it has collected. On 12 January 2004, Brazil will provide a more detailed analysis of the US failure to cooperate in this proceeding by continuing to refuse to provide Brazil and the Panel with the requested information.
8. In view of the US failure to produce the requested information that would allow Brazil and the Panel to calculate easily the amount of direct and counter-cyclical payments (as well as PFC and market loss assistance payments for MY 1999-2001), Brazil must present below revised figures using its so-called "14/16th" methodology.10 The figures represent the best information available and are corroborated by circumstantial evidence. Moreover, in view of the US refusal to produce the actual information regarding direct payment and counter-cyclical payments, the Panel could reasonably infer that the actual amounts are greater than those estimated by Brazil.
9 Brazil pointed this out more than a month ago when it stated in its 18 November Further Rebuttal Submission, that "CCC-509 does indicate the quantity of base acreage fir each programme crop on the farm. Since both CCC-509 and FSA-578 require identification of the identical `farm' by a unique farm serial number, the base acreage from CCC-509 can be matched with the planted acreage in FSA-578. What the United States has failed to do is `connect the dots,' i.e., match the information in the two forms." (Brazil's 18 November Further Rebuttal Submission, para. 44, emphasis in original, footnotes omitted).
10 In view of the new information provided by the United States in Exhibit US-95, Brazil has adjusted the total amount of contract payments by a ratio of 13.714 million acres of actual upland cotton plantings in MY 2002 to 18.858 million acres of total upland cotton base.

9. Concerning the export credit guarantee programmes, Brazil estimates the amount of payments
using the "guaranteed loan subsidy" estimate FY 2003 (which largely overlaps with MY 2002) results in a subsidy amount of $17 million.16 In sum, the latest data available to Brazil continues to
demonstrate that US support to upland cotton in MY 2002 far exceeds the support decided in MY
1992.

197. Please provide actual data for 2002/2003 for US exports, US consumption and per cent of world consumption to replace the projected data in Exhibit US-47. If available, please provide projected data for 2003/2004 to replace the forecast data. USA

11 Taken from Table 1 of Brazil's 9 September Further Rebuttal Submission. 12 Exhibit Bra-373 (Loan Deficiency Payment and Price Support Activity as of 12/3/2003). 13 Brazil notes that the United States also paid $104.2 million in fulfilment of its reinsurance obligations towards the insurance companies providing the insurance policies to upland cotton producers. These payments also constitute support to upland cotton, but Brazil had so far not included them in its calculation of the total support to upland cotton. This amount results from a MY 2002 loss ratio of 1.26, i.e., the 26 per cent of the $400,666,618 in indemnity payments were not covered by the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation or producer premium payments. These $104.2 million were paid by the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation (See Exhibit Bra-374 ("Crop Year Statistics MY 2002" ­ Federal Crop Insurance Corporation). 14 This calculation is based on total direct payments for upland cotton base of $625 million (US 27 August Comments, Table at para. 28 reporting PFC payments for MY 2002 of $452 million and additional direct payments of $173 million). This figure has been adjusted by the ratio of MY 2002 plantings (13.714 million acres) and MY 2002 direct payment base acreage (18.858 million acres) (See Exhibit US-95). 15 Brazil has used the direct payment of $454.5 million and adjusted it by the ratio of the direct payment rate of 6.67 cent per pound basis and the CCP payment rate for MY 2002 of 13.76 cents per pound. 16 Brazil refers the Panel to Exhibits Bra-333 (Cotton: World Markets and Trade, USDA, October 2003, Table 3) for the amount of cotton exports that were covered by export credit guarantees during the fiscal years that overlap with MY 2002 (FY 2002 and FY 2003). Since the overlap is largely with fiscal year 2003, Brazil has used the share of cotton export credit guarantees ($349.63 million) of the total guarantees made available ($5,953 million) under GSM 102 and GSM 103 in that year to calculated the amount of payments as estimated by the FCRA formula. The original subsidy estimate for FY 2003 (taken from the 2004 budget) is $294 million. The share attributable to cotton export credit guarantees would be $17 million.

Brazil's Answer:
10. Brazil has no reason to disagree with the US calculations which appear based on information exclusively within the control of the United States.
199. What is the composition of the A-Index? We do note footnote 19 and, for example, Exhibit BRA-11, but please explain more in detail how this index is calculated. BRA
Brazil's Answer:
11. Brazil refers the Panel to the statement made by Andrew Macdonald in Annex II of Brazil's 9 September Further Submission that provides considerable detail about the calculation and formation of the A-Index.17 Further information is set forth in Exhibit Bra-375.18 The A-Index, along with the B-Index, are two important indices that summarize the price developments of the physical market in various countries around the world. Both indices are published by Cotlook, Inc., a private company, and reflect an average price.19 As an index, it is not a trading or negotiable price, but a composite of quotations from the major producing origins around the world, much like a poll.
12. The A-Index is published weekly by the Cotton Outlook and calculated daily based on daily cotton price quotes converted on the basis of delivery to Northern European ports. The A-Index is generated based on Cotlook receiving daily information as regards quotations for upland cotton referring to 16 different origins. The quotes are for an upland cotton described as quality Middling Grade with a 1 3/32" staple length. The 16 quoted prices that are eligible for inclusion in the A-Index include prices for Brazilian Middling 1 3/32" upland cotton as well as prices for US Memphis and California/Arizona Middling 1 3/32" upland cotton.20 The A-Index value of the day represents the average of the five cheapest quotes out of the 16 quotes that are considered for the index calculation. The price quotes are derived from a variety of physical markets, merchants and trade information, which is gathered telephonically and analyzed for consistency and logic.21
13. Andrew Macdonald testified that growers, consumers and traders perceive the A- (and BIndex), along with the New York futures prices as reflecting the "world" market price for cotton.22
200. Concerning the chart on page 37 of Brazil's further rebuttal submission, why did Brazil use a futures price at planting time? Is this a relevant measure for assessing acreage response? BRA
Brazil's Answer:
14. Brazil presented the nearby futures chart in its 18 November Further Rebuttal Submission23 to rebut US arguments that US producers allegedly respond to market price signals in making their

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-283
planting decisions.24 Because the United States' 18 November Further Rebuttal Submission focused on the December Futures price in February as the relevant contract month to gauge producer's revenue expectations, Brazil presented a similar chart in its 2 December Oral Statement based on average December futures prices in January-March planting period.25 Using December futures prices (like the nearby futures chart) confirms USDA's economists ­ and the world's leading cotton trader's26 ­ conclusions that US subsidies make cotton producers largely unresponsive to market price signals.27

201. Is data available to show the proportion of US upland cotton production sold under futures contracts, and the prices under those contracts, at different times during the marketing year? If so, please provide summarized versions to the Panel. How does a futures sale impact the producer's entitlement to marketing loan programme payments? BRA, USA
Brazil's Answer:
15. Brazil has reviewed the questions very carefully and regrets that it does not have a clear understanding of the meanings of the terms used. Therefore, Brazil provides alternative answers depending on the possible intent of the questions/terms used. Brazil regrets if it has misinterpreted the terms in the questions and would welcome the opportunity to provide additional comments if the Panel should so desire.
16. The first question focuses on data relating to "cotton production sold under futures contracts." The term "futures contracts" could have several meanings in the context of this dispute. First, if the phrase "production sold under futures contracts" means the amount of US production sold on a forward delivery basis, the answer is that Brazil has no access to any such data. However, Brazil notes that all US upland cotton that is exported is for "future delivery" because it takes time to actually ship cotton from the United States, and some contracts are more "future" than other contracts. Theoretically, it would be possible to take the volume of US upland cotton exported each week and assume that it was sold at the average A-Index price that week. However, this would only be an estimate and would not necessarily reflect the price received by the US producers, or the prices received by the exporter. Prices received by US producers are tabulated by USDA and are before the Panel.28 Average A-Index prices are also evidence before the Panel and are found in Exhibit Bra-311. If this is the information sought by the Panel, Brazil would be pleased to provide an estimate.
17. If the phrase "production sold under futures contracts" means contracts for future delivery where the contract for sale contains a pricing clause pegged to the New York futures price at the time of delivery, then the answer to the first question is "no," i.e., there is no data that would provide the amount of production sold through such contracts. The record contains evidence that Brazilian and Chad producers and purchasers of upland cotton use such clauses in their contracts.29 Brazil has no access to information concerning the amount of US upland cotton sold through such contracts.
18. Finally, if the phrase "cotton production sold under futures contracts" means the amount of US upland cotton that is sold through the New York cotton futures exchange, the answer is "very

little." As Andrew Macdonald has indicated, the purpose of the futures market is not for the buying or selling of physical cotton.30 Rather, it is used for hedging position for growers and the upland cotton industry while the speculators in the market provide the day-to-day liquidity.31 Physical delivery is theoretically possible in order to give reality to the market, i.e., it is always possible to take or give delivery of cotton at the expiration of the contract. This ensures that the futures truly reflect the market and vice versa. However, the volume normally delivered is very small compared to the total volume traded during the life of a contract. This is because traders with long (or buy) futures contracts and traders with short (or sell) futures contracts "close out" or "settle" the contracts by offsetting trades at the end of the contract period and, thus, no physical cotton is delivered.32
19. With respect to the final question of whether a "futures sale impacts the producer's entitlement to marketing loan programme payments," the answer is "no." A producer is entitled to receive a marketing loan payment independent from any futures price or selling price that the producer may receive. A producer receives a marketing loan benefit if ­ after having taken out a marketing loan ­ he sells the upland cotton, i.e., loses the beneficial interest to the upland cotton, or foregoes the right to a marketing loan in favour of a LDP payment, which is paid upon ginning of the raw cotton.33 The process of marketing and selling the upland cotton in the United States or for export through forward contracts to supply upland cotton in the future, or contracts which set the price based on future New York futures market prices does not impact in any way the amount the US producer receives in marketing loan payments. The amount of marketing loan payment solely depends on the difference between the loan rate and the adjusted world price. Whether the actual selling price is below or above the loan rate, or below or above the adjusted world price, has no impact on the amount of the marketing loan benefit. The fact that producers may sell at prices above the adjusted world price means that they generate a combined revenue from the market and the marketing loan programme that exceeds 52 cents per pound.
202. Concerning paragraph 7 of the US oral statement, are the expected cash prices shown for February only? Can the US provide the prices for January and March of each year as well? USA
203. Please provide information concerning the organization, mandate, credentials and standing of FAPRI. BRA
Brazil's Answer:
20. The Food and Agricultural Policy Research Institute (FAPRI) was established in 1984 by a grant of Congress and continues to be financed largely by the US Congress. FAPRI is a unique dualuniversity programme by the Center for Agricultural and Rural Development (CARD) at Iowa State University34 and the Center for National Food and Agricultural Policy at the University of Missouri (Columbia),35 with researchers at the University of Missouri focusing mainly on the domestic / US side of agriculture and researchers at Iowa State University focusing mainly on international agricultural issues. FAPRI uses comprehensive data and computer modeling systems to analyze the

complex economic interrelationships of the food and agriculture industry.36 FAPRI's mission is to provide objective qualitative and quantitative analyses of alternative US and international agricultural policies.
21. FAPRI is considered the leading US agricultural policy research institute and ever since the 1985 farm bill37 has conducted analyses of alternative policies that have helped shape US farm legislation. In July 2002, FAPRI received the USDA Secretary's Honor Award, the highest award bestowed by the US Department of Agriculture, for its analysis of various farm bill proposals that led to the 2002 FSRI Act.38 Professor Bruce Babcock described the award as follows:
This award recognizes the outstanding research effort by FAPRI at [Iowa State University] and [the University of] Missouri in analyzing policy proposals during the 2002 farm bill debate. This group has dedicated itself to being the world's best at conducting agricultural policy analysis.39
...
World economic integration makes it increasingly vital that we understand the impacts of US policy decisions on US and world markets, producers and consumers. Increasing numbers of policy proposals and their complexity requires that we continually update our analytical capabilities and our market intelligence.40
22. FARPI is the leading research institution that fulfills this task in the United States. FAPRI prepares baseline projections each year for the US agricultural sector and international commodity markets. The multi-year projections are published as FAPRI Outlooks,41 which provide a starting point for evaluating and comparing scenarios involving macroeconomic, policy, weather, and technology variables.42 These projections are intended for use by farmers, government agencies and officials, agribusinesses, and others who do medium-range and long-term planning.43
23. FAPRI describes its objectives as follows:
· To prepare baseline projections for the US agricultural sector and international commodity markets. These multi-year projections are available in print and on the Web.
· To examine the major commodity markets and analyze alternative policies and external factors for implications on production, utilization, farm and retail prices, farm income, trade, and government costs.
· To help determine effective risk management tools for crop and livestock producers, and to analyze how government policy affects risk management strategies.

· To disseminate research results through printed reports, staff presentations, and on the Web.44
24. In sum, FAPRI is the most influential organization in the United States analyzing farm policy and its effects on US and world commodity markets, i.e., that has the highest reputation and experience in answering the kind of "but for" questions faced by this Panel. This is a fact implicitly recognized by Dr. Glauber who indicated on 2 December in responding to the Panel's oral questions that the United States was not contesting FAPRI's work or analysis but rather took issue with Professor's Sumner's modifications to and use of the FAPRI baseline.
204. Which support to upland cotton is not captured in the EWG data referred to in Brazil's 18 November further rebuttal submission? BRA
Brazil's Answer:
25. While Brazil believes that the EWG data is a useful indicator of the amount of support provided to producers of upland cotton, the EWG data undercounts the amount of support in several basic ways. First, the database undercounts the amount of marketing loan payments reflected in FSA's "LDP / Loan / Market Gain Activity" Summary Report by $572 million for MY 2000 through MY 2002.45 The EWG database also undercounts the amount of contract payments by $61 million in MY 2000 and MY 2001.46 This means that there are very likely additional farms and recipients of upland cotton contract payments that also received marketing loan payments, but that are not tracked by EWG data.
26. Second, as described more fully in Christopher Campbell's statement in Exhibit Bra-316, the database also undercounts the percentage of contract payments to farms growing upland cotton, because marketing loan certificates are often purchased by partnerships, with the partnership receiving the payment from USDA.47 There can be multiple partners in these partnerships that eventually get a portion of the marketing loan certificate payment. These partners are not recorded in the EWG data as receiving marketing loan payment ­ thus as upland cotton producers ­ but they are, in fact, producers of upland cotton that will most likely receive contract payments.
27. Third, current producers of upland cotton also received contract payments from base acreage other than upland cotton. The EWG database does not readily permit the allocation of these payments without the application of a complex methodology requiring a number of assumptions. Only farmspecific data exclusively controlled by the United States, which it continues to refuse to provide to Brazil and the Panel, would permit such a calculation.
28. The EWG data, however, provides corroborating evidence that Brazil's "14th/16th" methodology is a reasonable approximation of the amount of contract payments that are support to upland cotton. In view of the continued refusal of the United States to provide the requested information on contract payments and acreage matched by farm, the Panel should infer that Brazil's methodology of calculating these payments undercounts the actual amount of contract payments that constitute support to upland cotton.

205. Does the United States accept or agree with the EWG data submitted by Brazil? If not, please explain your reasons. USA
206. Please explain how the graph in paragraph 40 of the US further rebuttal submission was derived. In so doing, please clarify whether the figures are on a cents per pound basis or some other basis. What averaging method was used? Can you prepare individual charts showing average US and Brazilian cotton prices for each of those third country markets? USA
207. Please indicate whether any of the measures challenged in this dispute obliges cotton farmers to harvest their crop in order to receive the benefit of the programme (subsidy). USA
208. Please provide data for the marketing years 1992 and 1999-2002 of the "quantity of production to receive the applied administered price" (Agreement on Agriculture, Annex 3, paragraph 8) for purposes of a price-gap calculation of support through the marketing loan programme. USA
209. It is understood that the data in the graph in paragraph 5 of the US oral statement are as at harvest time, while the data in the graph in paragraph 39 of Brazil's oral statement are as at planting time. Please explain why the trend of US acreage increase/decrease differs between these two graphs. BRA, USA
Brazil's Answer:
29. The trend between those two graphs differs because they provide a different measure for US upland cotton acreage. The graph at paragraph 5 of the US 2 December Oral Statement shows harvested acreage, while the graph at paragraph 39 of Brazil's Oral Statement shows planted acreage. The figures differ because not all planted US upland cotton is harvested. The rate of abandonment that describes the difference between planted acres and harvested acres is significant in the United States. During MY 1996-2002 it varied between 3.6 per cent in MY 1997 and 20 per cent in MY 1998. The average for the period was 12.2 per cent.48
30. Brazil notes that US upland cotton farmers naturally reflect their planting decisions in planted ­ not harvested ­ acreage. To analyze whether the planting decisions of upland cotton farmers in the United Sates are "congruent" to farmers in other parts of the world, it would be best to compare planted acreage figures. Harvested acreage figures are a function of weather effects that may cause the abandonment of a significant portion of planted acreage. This is relatively common in the arid cotton producing areas of the US Southwest and less common in the irrigated regions of the US West or in the high rainfall regions of the South. Brazil also refers the Panel to its response to Question 210.
210. Are worldwide planted acreage figures available? BRA, USA
Brazil's Answer:
31. To the best of Brazil's knowledge, there are no planted acreage figures available on a worldwide basis. However, the fact that these figures do not or may not exist does not render the US harvested acreage graph valid for the purpose of evaluating the responsiveness of the US farmer to world prices.
48 Exhibit Bra-4 ("Fact Sheet: Upland Cotton," USDA, January 2003, p. 4).

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-288

32. Nonetheless, variations in harvested acreage could be a reasonable proxy for variations in planted acreage for the world outside the United States. The reason is that the relationship between planted acreage and harvested acreage on a worldwide basis can be assumed to be relatively stable, i.e., weather-related problems likely lead to the abandonment of about the same percentage of planted acreage at the aggregate level each year. Upland cotton is grown in many regions and worse than normal weather conditions in one region will be offset by better than normal weather in other regions. But this is not the case when only an individual country such as the United States is analyzed because individual countries have more variable weather. This is particularly true for the United States with the considerable variance in abandonment in the Southwest. Thus, for the United States, planted acreage is the appropriate measure of production decisions. By contrast, on the worldwide level, high abandonment in one region would be compensated or balanced out by low abandonment in other regions. On average, these differing trends would cancels each other out and worldwide harvested acreage would remain relatively stable over from year to year.
33. The following graph shows percentage changes in US planted acreage and percentage changes in non-US (harvested) acreage:49

As expected, the graph demonstrates that the decision-making process of US producers is quite different than that of non-US producers. US planted acreage moved in opposite directions to world harvested acreage between MY 1998-2000. In MY 1996, 1997 and 2001, US planted acreage changes to a far greater extent than non-US planted acreage.50 Given those significant differences, for any valid statistical analysis, this graph could not possibly be used to support a claim that planting decisions in the US were analogous to those made worldwide. In fact, taken together with the other evidence that US producers are not sensitive to market signals,51 this graph confirms that US producers are insulated from market forces and act independently of competitors' behavior.
49 The US planted acreage is taken from Exhibit Bra-4 ("Fact Sheet: Upland Cotton," USDA, January 2003, p. 4) and Non-US acreage is taken from Exhibit US-63.
50 The non-US planted acreage is approximated by using non-US harvested acreage. As discussed above, with a stable rate of abandonment, changes in harvested acreage equal changes in planted acreage.
51 Brazil's 18 November Further Rebuttal Submission, Section 3.4 with further references.

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-289
34. The United States relies on its "harvested acreage" chart to argue that "US producers have increased and decreased acreage commensurately with producers in the rest of the world" relying on data for MY 1996-2002.52 But even using this inappropriate harvested acreage chart, the same disconnect between US producers and other world producers can be seen. Only in two out of seven years is there a similar movement in the harvested acreage of the US and the rest of the world. In the other five years, the movement either goes in the opposite direction or the magnitude of the acreage movement is much smaller or greater respectively.
35. These distinctly different reactions by US and non-US farmers are consistent with the fact that non-US farmers must actually deal with market signals. The significant production declines by Mato Grosso producers in MY 2000 and 2001 in the face of record low prices (even though they are among the world's highest yield and lowest cost producers) illustrate this point well.53 In addition, the fact that US farmers' planted acreage did not significantly decline in MY 1999-2002 is totally inconsistent with the considerable exchange rate increases of the US dollar during the same period.
36. Finally, even in MY 2002 when US acreage movements were relatively consistent with the rest of the world, the effect of the US subsidies significantly dampened the decrease in US acreage. As Professor has demonstrated, the US planted acreage in MY 2002 would have been 7.5 million acres without US subsidies not the 13.7 million acres actually planted.54 Thus, the effect of the US subsidies is better estimated by examining the amount (or level) of US planted acres, rather than percentage changes in which the graph moves. Were it not for the US subsidies, the US downward trend in MY 2002 would have been much sharper, as a large number of inefficient cotton producers would have chosen not to plant or would have switched crops.
211. Brazil presents a graph in paragraph 59 of its further rebuttal submission indicating the increasing cumulative loss incurred by cotton producers. Please comment on the argument that US cotton producers could not continue operating without subsidies. In particular:
(a) to what extent does the use of 1997 survey technological coefficients with annually updated values affect the results?
(b) to what extent do producers base planting decisions on their ability to cover operating costs but not whole farm costs? USA
212. Brazil states in paragraph 37 of its oral statement that studies of Westcott and Price found that the effect of the programme on cotton is to add an additional 1 to 1.5 million acres during marketing years 1999-2001 and to suppress US prices by 5 cents per pound. Does the US reject these findings? Why or why not? USA
213. What differences, if any, can be observed in the results of econometric models in the literature which use lagged prices and those which use futures prices to analyse the effect of prices on planting decisions? BRA, USA

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-290
Brazil's Answer:55
37. Econometric simulation models of the sort used by Professor Sumner, USDA and other independent economic analysts have not used futures markets in their projections or counterfactual analysis. Instead, analysts have used either lagged prices and revenues or some variant of lagged or actual realized prices or revenues as the representation of grower expectations. Thus, there are no comparisons that one could make in this regard.
38. As previously noted, "it is impossible to know what precisely individual farmers expect"56 because price expectations of farmers are "fundamentally unobservable."57 It is important to note that USDA economists Westcott and Price, like Professor Sumner, have used and relied on the same retrospective analysis of the effects of marketing loans using so-called "lagged prices" ­ not futures prices. The United States notes that the use of a futures price analysis for MY 2002 is not possible for "multi-commodity modeling frameworks for extended time projection."58 The United States accepts that FAPRI, USDA and the US Congressional Budget Office use lagged prices rather than futures prices as proxies for price expectations.59 And Dr. Glauber indicated during the second Panel meeting on 3 December that the United States accepts the FAPRI modeling system as a valid means to analyze the questions faced by this Panel.
39. The statistical estimation literature in agricultural economics has used a variety of proxies for anticipated prices and revenue for the upcoming season. These include rational expectations in which many sources of information available to decision makers are combined and the expectations are consistent with the conditional forecasts of the model. Such models have strong theoretical grounding but have been impractical in most estimation situations.
40. No systematic survey has been undertaken of the very large statistical literature estimating supply functions to study how estimates differ based on assumed models of the formation of expectations.60 In a recent study for rice, McDonald and Sumner61 found that most published articles for rice (another US programme crop with complex government programmes) used a variant of lagged information to project prices and future revenue per acre. None of the rice estimates used futures markets.
41. Across a wide variety of commodities, no systematic differences are noticeable in estimated supply or acreage response depending on how expectations of prices and other revenue terms are represented in the model. That is, there is no evidence that the estimated acre response elasticity are systematically lower or higher using futures markets to represent the price that then enters the projected relative net revenue function used for estimation.
42. Finally, if the United States were right (which it is not) that futures prices are a better indicator of farmers' price expectations, then Professor Sumner's results are not wrong, but
55 The information and analysis in this answer was provided by Professor Sumner. 56 Brazil's 9 September Further Submission, Annex I, para. 18. 57 Exhibit Bra-279 (Statement of Professor Sumner ­ 7 October 2003, para. 9). See also Exhibit Bra361 (Cotton Pricing Guide, July 2001) containing guidance for farmers to take planting and marketing decisions. 58 US 7 October Oral Statement, para. 34. 59 US 7 October Oral Statement, para. 34. 60 Exhibit Bra-306 (Lin, William, Paul C. Westcott, Robert Skinner, Scott Sanford, and Daniel G. De La Torre Ugarte. Supply Response Under the 1996 Farm Act and Implications for the US Field Crops Sector, TB-1888, US Department of Agriculture, Economic Research Service, July 2000) provides a survey of the literature and cites mostly studies that use a variant of lagged prices. Lin et al. use both lagged prices and futures markets to represent expectations. 61 Exhibit Bra-381 (Jeffrey D. McDonald and Daniel A. Sumner. "The Influence of Commodity Programmes on Acreage Response to Market Price: With an Illustration concerning Rice Policy in the United States." American Journal of Agricultural Economics, (85) 4 (November 2003): 857-871).

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-291
conservative. This is, because, as a matter of statistical theory, the more precise the proxy for expected price or revenue, the larger the coefficient of supply response. For example, in regression estimations, when an explanatory variable is measured with error, the regression coefficient tends to be biased toward zero, thus undercounting the significance of the variable. When there is less error in measurement (i.e., the imperfectly measured proxy variable becomes more accurate) the regression coefficient tends to be larger.62 In the present context, this means that if futures market prices were better proxies for farmers' expectations, the estimated coefficient of the price or revenue effect on acreage (the acreage response elasticity) would be larger. It follows that the estimated acreage response elasticity would be too low in the FAPRI model. US acreage would respond stronger to changes in relative cotton revenue than estimated in the FAPRI models. In the context of the Professor Sumner's simulation analysis, that would mean larger US supply response to expected price and revenue changes, and thus higher supply and export response to government programme benefits. In sum, Professor Sumner's results, which are based on FAPRI elasticity estimates, would not be wrong, but would underestimate the amount of additional acreage, production and exports from US policy incentives.
III. Domestic Support
214. Please provide a copy of regulations regarding the marketing loan programme and loan deficiency payments published at 58 Federal Register 15755, dated 24 March 1993. What does this regulation indicate about the target price? USA
215. Please expand or comment on the statement at paragraph 91 of the US further rebuttal submission that the counter-cyclical target price ceases to be paid when the farm price rises above 65.73 cents per pound. In this scenario, should the Panel disregard Direct Payments? BRA, USA
Brazil's Answer:
43. It is correct that the CCP payments cease when average US farm prices for the marketing year received by US farmers rise above 65.73 cents per pound. But this has only happened four times since the 1930s and the last time was seven years ago in MY 1996. In MY 2002, the average price received by US farmers was 40.50 cents per pound.63 Through November 2003, MY 2003 average price received by US farmers was 58.5 cents per pound.64 Indeed, the first CCP payment has been made for MY 2003.65
44. The impact of the direct payments has been analyzed and quantified by Professor Sumner who found, using the FAPRI November 2002 baseline, that in MY 2002 direct payments added 120,000 acres to US upland cotton production.66
45. Even in the highly unlikely event that expected US farm prices were to exceed the CCP target price of 72.4 cents per pound for MY 200467 (prices that have occurred only twice in the past 75 years), direct payments would still be made and US producers would still require direct payments

Exhibit Bra-4 ("Fact Sheet Upland Cotton," USDA, January 2003, p. 5).

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-292
to cover the total cost of current production. These payments, like the other payments in the package of cotton subsidies, are essential to maintain past, current, and future high levels of US upland cotton production.68 Thus, they must be taken into account in assessing the production-distorting effects they caused in MY 2002 as well as today in MY 2003.
46. Brazil recalls that even if futures price were to indicate that US farm prices will be at or somewhat above the target price, the programme has a significant impact on planting decisions. At planting time, the producer still is unsure on whether or not the target price will be met during the following marketing year. Given the considerable price fluctuations and the low prices in the MY 1997-2002 period, there is a significant risk that actual prices will be lower than the futures market predicts. The direct and counter-cyclical payments remove the risks of lower prices. The evidence of a long-term lack of any significant US acreage response to higher or lower prices since MY 1996 demonstrates that US producers have and will continue to plant upland cotton because they face no downside revenue risk. Professor Sumner outlined this effect when he responded to a similar question by the Panel at the second meeting with the parties.69 This reinforces the argument that the Panel cannot disregard these payments in the scenario described in the question.
216. How many times have upland cotton producers been able to update their base acres since 1984? How do upland cotton producers come to note the possibility of future updating? Please provide examples of relevant material. BRA, USA
Brazil's Answer:
47. Under the deficiency payment programme as provided by the 1985 and 1990 Farm Acts, farmers were offered the option to update the amount of acreage participating in the programme each year. To do this, they were required to opt out of the programme and receive no payments during the period in which they increased the amount of acreage planted to the programme crop. Relatively few upland cotton farmers took advantage of this programme feature because the costs of forgoing payments in the current year generally outweighed the present value of benefits of higher base acres and base yield in the future.
48. In the 1996 FAIR Act, farmers established their production flexibility base acreage by carrying over the would-be deficiency payment base acreage. For example, any producers of upland cotton during the period MY 1991-1995 were entitled to place such acreage into the PFC programme along with any acreage that had been in the conservation programme and was released from that programme in MY 1996.70 Unlike the 1985 and 1990 Farm Acts, the 1996 FAIR Act did not authorize any acreage or yield updates by individual farmers during later years. In the 1996 FAIR Act, Congress essentially told farmers they should take advantage of planting flexibility and that planting alternative crops would not affect the amount of their payments. However, several years after 1996, as commodity prices began to decline, momentum for an update in the next farm act began to build. Many upland cotton farmers and others argued that their historical acreage and yields no longer reflected the reality of their current production and that they needed additional payments on their increased programme crop acreage. These upland cotton and other programme crop growers

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-293
including wheat, feed grains, and rice pressured Congress to include updating of acreage and yield bases in the 2002 Farm Bill.71
49. The 2002 FSRI Act provided for the opportunity for all farmers to update their base acreage for purposes of the direct payment programme and to update their base acreage and base yields for purposes of the counter-cyclical payment programme. They could do this without having to temporarily opt out of the programmes, which they needed to do under the deficiency payments programme. The 2002 update and the individual deficiency payment updates during 1985-1995 established the principle that acreage and yield base updates are a part of the farm policy in the United States. Even though no updates are explicitly provided for during the lifespan of the 2002 FSRI Act, farmers may reasonably expect future updates, either as a part of ad hoc legislation or as a part of the regularly scheduled new law in 2007.
50. The pressure for updates will come especially from farmers who were not in a position to take advantage of the 2002 update having switched away from higher per-acre payment crops like upland cotton or rice. For example, farmers who had planted less than their full upland cotton base to upland cotton in the MY 1998 to 2001 period would likely have found the acreage update unattractive. But, since the yield update was only available to farmers who updated acreage, these farmers also missed the opportunities to update yields. These farmers expressed deep disappointment in 2002 that they had used planting flexibility, only to find that they were penalized by not being allowed to update payment yields. These farmers saw the update of 2002 by farmers who had stayed in upland cotton production during MY 1998-2001 as unfair and look to have this redressed in the next revision of the programmes. Many of those (non-updating) farmers are now planting their full upland cotton base (or more) and are maintaining high and expanding inputs to expand their yields in order to be in a position to take advantage of an anticipated base update at the next opportunity. These farmers will add to the political pressure to update base in 2007, if not before.
217. What is the reason for reducing payments under the PFC and direct payments programmes for planting and harvesting fruit, vegetables and wild rice on certain base acreage? Please comment on the statements by the European Communities that "the reduction in payment for fruit and vegetables, if the EC understands correctly, is in fact designed to avoid unfair competition within the subsidising Member." (EC oral statement at first session, first substantive meeting, paragraph 29) and "To find otherwise would not permit a WTO Member wishing to introduce decoupled payments to take account of important elements of internal competition (...)" (EC response to Panel third party Question No. 5). USA
218. Please comment on the testimony of USDA Chief Economist Keith Collins cited in paragraph 36 of Brazil's oral statement regarding the trade-distorting and productiondistorting nature of the marketing loan payments. USA
IV. Export Credit Guarantees
219. Under the Agreement on Agriculture the general position is that the use of export subsidies, both those listed in Article 9.1 as well as those within the scope of Article 1(e) which are not so listed, may only be used within the limits of the product specific reduction commitments specified in Part IV of Members' Schedules. One might therefore have expected that Article 3.3 of the Agreement on Agriculture would have prohibited the use of both listed and non-listed export subsidies in excess of reduction commitment levels in the case of scheduled products and, in the case of non-scheduled products, would have simply prohibited the use of any export subsidy. Instead, the Article 3.3 prohibition is limited in both cases to export

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-294
subsidies listed in Article 9.1. What significance, if any, does this contextual aspect have for how Article 10.2 might be interpreted having regard, inter alia, to:
(a) the fact that export performance-related tax incentives, which like subsidised export credit facilities were considered as a possible candidate for listing as an Article 9.1 export subsidy in the pre-December 1991 Draft Final Act negotiations, have been held (for example, in United States ­ Tax Treatment for Foreign Sales Corporations, WT/DS108) to be subject to the anti-circumvention provisions of Article 10.1; and
(b) the treatment of international food aid and non-commercial transactions under Article 10? USA
220. What will be the relevance of Articles 9 and 10.1 of the Agreement of Agriculture to export credit guarantees when disciplines are internationally agreed? BRA
Brazil's Answer:
51. The relevance of Articles 9 and 10.1 of the Agreement on Agriculture following the conclusion of the negotiations called for by Article 10.2 of the Agreement necessarily depends on the commitments that are negotiated. Brazil does not know what the outcome of the negotiations will be, or what commitments, if any, parties will undertake. Nor does Brazil know in what way those commitments would be brought into the WTO ­ automatically, via the cross-reference in Article 10.2, or instead via amendments to the Agreement on Agriculture or the SCM Agreement, or yet some other means. The nature of the disciplines negotiated and the way in which those disciplines are transposed into the WTO will dictate the effect they will have on Articles 9 and 10.1. With these important reservations about the purely hypothetical nature of this exercise, Brazil will explore a number of possible outcomes and the impact those outcomes would have on Articles 9 and 10.1.
52. One possible outcome is that negotiators will reach agreement on other types of export credits, but that export credit guarantees will not be included. In Brazil's view, this would mean that export credit guarantees would continue not to be among those per se export subsidies listed in Article 9.1, and would continue to be subject to Article 10.1, to the extent that they constitute export subsidies and circumvent (or threaten to circumvent) a Member's export subsidy commitments.
53. Another possible outcome is an amendment to Article 9.1 that would add export credit guarantees (or possibly those export credit guarantees issued or programmes maintained on particular terms or conditions) to the list of per se export subsidies. Article 10.1 would no longer be applicable, since export credit guarantees would no longer be "[e]xport subsidies not listed in paragraph 1 of Article 9 ... ."
54. Yet another possible outcome is agreement to subject export credit guarantees to the same type of notification, consultation and information exchange disciplines agreed in the OECD Arrangement on Officially Supported Export Credits for industrial products ("OECD Arrangement").72 For example, the OECD Arrangement includes provisions regarding: prior notification of derogations, permitted exceptions, matching of derogations, permitted exceptions, nonconforming non-notified terms, and terms granted by countries that are not parties to the OECD Arrangement. The United States now characterizes such disciplines as "pedestrian."73 In Canada ­ Aircraft II, however, the United States characterized these provisions and the disciplines they

provided as central to the "entire logic" of the OECD Arrangement, and as a critical way to prevent "a subsidy `race to the bottom.'"74
55. Under this outcome, export credit guarantees would continue not to be among those per se export subsidies listed in Article 9.1, and would continue to be subject to Article 10.1, to the extent that they constitute export subsidies and circumvent (or threaten to circumvent) a Member's export subsidy commitments. Under WTO jurisprudence, the provisions regarding notification, consultation and information exchange would be read cumulatively with Article 10.1, since the obligations imposed would not be mutually exclusive or mutually inconsistent.75
56. Another possible outcome would be agreement on alternative benchmarks against which to determine whether export credit guarantees and export credit guarantee programmes would constitute export subsidies. In determining what constitutes an "export subsidy" within the meaning of Article 10.1, the Appellate Body's decisions in US ­ FSC76 and Canada ­ Dairy77 currently direct the Panel to refer to contextual guidance included in Articles 1 and 3 of the SCM Agreement and in item (j).78 Were agreement one day reached on alternative benchmarks following negotiations pursuant to Article 10.2, that agreement might provide relevant context for a panel to determine what constitutes an "export subsidy" for the purposes of Article 10.1. Alternatively, it might serve as "subsequent practice," pursuant to Article 31(3)(b) of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, indicating the interpretation of the term "export subsidy" that the Members intend for the purposes of Article 10.1.79
57. Under this outcome, export credit guarantees would continue not to be among those per se export subsidies listed in Article 9.1. Moreover, they would continue to be subject to Article 10.1, to the extent that they constitute export subsidies, and to the extent that they circumvent (or threaten to circumvent) a Member's export subsidy commitments. The difference would be that the interpretation of the term "export subsidy" might be based, among other things, on the context or evidence of "subsequent practice" offered by the newly-negotiated alternative benchmark.
221. In respect of the table in paragraph 161 of the US August 22 rebuttal submission (concerning the cohort specific treatment of export credit guarantees), the Panel notes the subsequent US agreement (footnotes 82 and 96 in US further submission of 30 September 2003; footnote 160 in US 18 November further rebuttal submission) to Brazil's assertion (footnote 67 in Brazil's 27 August 2003 comments on US rebuttal submission) that the total figure net of reestimates should be $230,127,023 instead of the figure which originally appeared ($381,345,059).

If agreement is reached among only the 10 WTO Members that participated in OECD discussions on agricultural export credit disciplines, it will be difficult to argue that the agreement serves as relevant context for interpretation of Article 10.1, which is applicable to 146 Members. Nor would such an agreement constitute evidence of "subsequent practice." See Appellate Body Report, Chile ­ Agricultural Products (Price Band), WT/DS207/AB/R, para. 213 (defining "subsequent practice" as "a `concordant, common and consistent' sequence of acts or pronouncements which is sufficient to establish a discernible pattern implying the agreement of the parties [to a treaty] regarding its interpretation.").

(a) Please submit a corrected table reflecting all of the necessary information to produce this result, to the extent this is possible for the reasons indicated in footnote 96 in US further submission of 30 September 2003.
(b) Please clarify whether and how the Panel should treat the figures in Exhibit BRA-182 for the net lifetime re-estimates for each respective cohort.
(c) The Panel notes that the CCC 2002 financial statement in Exhibit BRA-158 refers to annual "administrative" expenses of $4 million, and that the US has also referred to this figure in its submissions (e.g. US first written submission, paragraph 175). Please confirm whether the figures in the table in paragraph 161 of the US August 22 rebuttal submission (or a corrected version thereof) includes "administrative expenses", of approximately $4 million per year over the period 1992-2002, and explain why (or why not) this affects the substantive result.
Brazil's Comment:
58. With respect to the $4 million of administrative expenses for the CCC guarantee programmes, Brazil draws the Panel's attention to Congressional testimony by the administrator of the programmes, General Sales Manager Christopher Goldthwait. This testimony is included on pages 20-21 of Exhibit Bra-87. Mr. Goldthwait's testimony clarifies that premiums charged by the CCC are sufficient to cover these administrative expenses, but not other costs and losses of the programmes.
59. A member of Congress posed the following question to Mr. Goldthwait and August Schumacher, USDA's Under Secretary for Farm and Foreign Agricultural Services:
Is [the GSM] programme operated at essentially no net costs to the US Government? By that what I mean putting to one side the Iraq and the Poland experiences which you outlined earlier in your response to questions, do we charge fees that reflect the cost of administering the programme and the risk that is involved, the default, things such as that, or is this a programme which is subsidized at a fairly significant level by the Federal Government? (emphasis added)
Mr. Goldthwait's response was as follows:
Yes. The programme is from the administrative standpoint at least pretty much selffinancing. We do collect fees. The fee structure is relatively modest. We keep the fees low because the legislation has limited us to no more than 1 per cent. But, nonetheless, we collect several million dollars a year in fees, and that enables us to say that effectively the administrative cost of running the programme are more than covered. Now, that money does not come directly to us at the USDA, it goes to the general Treasury account, but the amount of the money is more than enough to cover the administrative costs of the programme. (emphasis added)
60. Thus, although the question asked whether fees covered "the cost of administering the programme and the risk that is involved, the default, things such as that," Mr. Goldthwait, the administrator of the CCC guarantee programmes, responded that fees "at least pretty much" covered only "the administrative cost of running the programme." Mr. Goldthwait could not state that the fees collected also cover "the risk that is involved, the default, things such as that," since, as Brazil has established, fees for the CCC guarantee programmes are not set to (see comment to question 223) and in fact do not cover those risks and defaults.

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-297
(d) Please identify what is considered an "administrative expense" for this purpose.
(e) The Panel notes the US statement in paragraph 160 of its answers to Panel questions following the first meeting that all cohorts are still open although the 1994 and 1995 cohorts will close this year. Is this still an accurate statement? If not, please indicate whether any cohorts have since "closed" for the period 19922002.
(f) The Panel notes the current "high" figures for 1997 and 1998 indicated in the original US chart. Pending their confirmation and/or updating by the US, why does the US assert that a cohort will necessarily reach a "profitable" result (for example, the 1994 cohort, which has almost closed still indicates an outstanding amount)? Do "re-estimates" reflect also expectations about a cohort's future performance?
Brazil's Comment:
61. Brazil reserves the right to comment on the US response, but would like to provide a preliminary comment on the last part of the Panel's question. To a certain extent, reestimates do reflect expectations about a cohort's future performance. Agencies are to undertake two types of reestimates ­ interest rate and technical reestimates. The Office of Management and Budget ("OMB") defines these two types of reestimates in the following way:
Two different types of reestimates are made:
· Interest rate reestimates, for differences between interest rate assumptions at the time of formulation (the same assumption is used at the time of obligation or commitment) and the actual interest rate(s) for the year(s) of disbursement; and
· Technical reestimates, for changes in technical assumptions.80
62. One purpose of technical reestimates is "to adjust the subsidy estimate for . . . new forecasts about future economic conditions, and other events and improvements in the methods used to estimate future cash flows."81 The OMB also states that one purpose of technical reestimates is to record "changes in assumptions about future cash flows."82
(g) Why should the Panel "eliminate" the 2001 and 2002 cohorts from its examination, as suggested in paragraph 198 of the US further rebuttal submission?
(h) Why should the Panel "eliminate", in addition, the 2000 cohort, as also suggested in paragraph 198 of the US further rebuttal submission for which information is presumably more "complete"?
(i) Under the US approach, at what point in time could a Panel ever make an assessment of the programme, if it had to wait for each cohort to be completed before it could be "properly" assessed? Why is it inappropriate for the Panel to

include these "most recent years" in its evaluation, as the US suggests in paragraph 199 of its 18 November further rebuttal submission? USA
222. For GSM 102, 103 and SCGP, please provide year-by-year amounts from 1992 to 2003 with respect to: (i) cumulative outstanding guarantees; (ii) claims paid; (iii) recoveries made; (iv) revenue from premiums; (v) other current revenue, including interest earned; (vi) interest charges paid; and (vii) administrative costs of running the programmes. Please indicate any allocation methodologies used to calculate administrative costs. USA
223. Are the premium rates applicable to GSM 102, 103 and SCGP subject to regular review as to their adequacy in enabling the operating costs and losses associated with these programmes? If so, what criteria or benchmarks are taken into consideration for this purpose? Secondly, how do the premium rates applied compare with the implicit cost of forfaiting transactions and with premiums for export credit insurance? USA
Brazil's Comment:
63. Brazil reserves the right to comment on the US response, but would like to provide a preliminary comment on the first part of the Panel's question. First, Brazil notes that premium rates for the three CCC guarantee programmes are not subject to regular review. In audit reports of the CCC's fiscal year 2000 and 2001 financial statements, USDA's Office of the Inspector General confirmed that "the fees CCC charges for its GSM-102 and GSM-103 export credit guarantee programmes have not been changed in 7 years and may not be reflecting current costs."83 Two changes have been made, in the fee schedule for GSM 102, since November 1994: (i) for a 12-month guarantee with semi-annual repayment intervals, the fee was changed from $0.209 per $100 of coverage to $0.229 per $100 of coverage; and (ii) borrowers are now offered the additional option of 30- and 60-day guarantees, at the same fee charged for 90-day and 4-, 6- and 7-month guarantees.84
64. Moreover, the US General Accounting Office ("GAO") analyzed CCC's failure to charge guarantee fees that take account of country risk or the creditworthiness of individual borrowers. The GAO emphasized that CCC's failure to do so means that it lacks the flexibility to cover the costs and losses of the programmes:
Although GSM-102 recipient countries vary significantly from one another in terms of their risk of defaulting on GSM-102 loans, CCC does not adjust the fee that it charges for credit guarantees to take account of country risk. CCC fees are based upon the length of the credit period and the number of principal payments to be made. For example, for a 3-year GSM-102 loan with semiannual principal payments, CCC charges a fee of 55.6 cents per $100, or 0.56 per cent of the covered amount. For 3year loans with annual principal payments, the fee is 66.3 cents per $100.[ ] CCC fees that included a risk-based component might not cover all of the country risk, but they could help to offset the cost of loan defaults.85

See also Exhibit Bra-154 (US Department of Agriculture Office of Inspector General Great Plains Region Audit Report of the Commodity Credit Corporation's Financial Statements for Fiscal Year 2001, Audit Report No. 06401-4-KC (February 2002), p. 49 ("[T]he fees CCC charged for its GSM-102 and GSM-103 export credit guarantee programmes have not been changed for many years and may not be reflecting current costs.").

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-299
As noted above, CCC fees for GSM 102 have not changed materially since the GAO published its report in 1995.86 Moreover, the United States confirmed in its 11 August Answer to Question 84 (at paragraph 180) that US law prohibits CCC from charging fees in excess of one per cent of the guaranteed dollar value of the transaction.
65. With respect to the second part of the Panel's question, Brazil has demonstrated that forfaits and export credit insurance are not similar financial instruments to CCC export credit guarantees, and therefore that the terms for forfaits and export credit insurance cannot serve as benchmarks against which to determine whether CCC export credit guarantees confer "benefits."87 Moreover, Brazil has demonstrated that in any event, fees for forfaiting instruments are well above fees for CCC export credit guarantees.88
66. Although government support from the US Export-Import Bank does not constitute a market benchmark for the purposes of determining "benefit," Brazil has offered evidence that premiums for CCC guarantees are considerably lower that fees for Ex-Im Bank guarantees.89 This demonstrates that the terms for CCC guarantees do not even meet non-market benchmarks. As noted by the GAO:
The US Export-Import Bank, which provides credit guarantees to promote a variety of US exports, uses risk-based fees to defray the cost of defaults on its portfolio. Under its system, each borrower/guarantor is rated in one of eight country risk categories. Exposure fees vary based on both the level of assessed risk and the length of time provided for repayment. For example, in the case of repayment over 3 years, a country rated in the lowest risk category is charged a fee of 75 cents per $100, whereas a country in the highest risk category is charged a fee of $5.70 per $100 of coverage. Thus, the bank's fee structure includes a substantial added charge for high country risk. According to the bank, its system is designed to remain as competitive as possible with fees charged by official export credit agencies of other countries.
Under section 211(b)(1)(b) of the 1990 Farm Bill, CCC is currently restricted from charging an origination fee for any GSM-102 credit guarantee in excess of an amount equal to 1 per cent of the amount of credit extended under the transaction.[90] This restriction was initially enacted in 1985 following proposed administration legislation to charge a 5-per cent user fee for exports backed with credit guarantees. Some Members of Congress were concerned that such a fee would adversely affect the competitiveness of GSM-102 exports. Under the 1-per cent restriction, CCC would be considerably limited in the size of the fee that it could charge to take account of country risk should it decide to do so. For example, as previously noted, CCC charges 0.56 per cent for a loan payable in 3 years and with principal payments due annually. The most it could increase the fee would be 0.44 per cent. In contrast, the Export-Import Bank currently charges fees as high as 5.7 per cent for 3-year loans.91

224. Please indicate how the CCC's cost of borrowing was treated in the 2002 financial statement of the CCC, in Exhibit BRA 158. USA
225. Please indicate whether there was any instance where the CCC "wrote off" debt and, if so, please indicate the accounting regulation or principle used. If a "written off" debt is subsequently recovered, do the CCC's accounts reflect both the interest cost and interest received in relation to the debt during the time it was "written off"? USA
226. If a debt was "written off" more than ten years ago, does it still create a cost to the programme? If so, how is this reflected in the 2002 financial statement of the CCC, in Exhibit BRA 158 (or any other material)? USA
227. The United States has indicated that Brazil continues to "mischaracterize" the amount of $411 million in the 2002 financial statement of the CCC, in Exhibit BRA 158, pp. 18 & 19. Can the United States please indicate how it believes this amount ­ referred to on p. 19 of the Exhibit as "Credit Guarantee Liability-End of Fiscal Year" - should be properly characterized? How, if at all, does it represent CCC operating costs or losses? USA
Brazil's Comment:
67. On page 4 of the notes to the CCC 2002 financial statements, CCC defines the term "Credit Guarantee Liability" as follows:
Credit guarantee liabilities represent the estimated net cash outflows (loss) of the guarantees on a net present value basis. To this effect, CCC records a liability and charges an expense to the extent, in management's estimate, CCC will be unable to recover claim payments under the post-Credit Reform Export Credit Guarantee programmes.92
Thus, Brazil stands by its characterization of the $411 million figure as a cumulative running tally of the losses for the programmes during the period 1992-2002, and as one way of demonstrating that the CCC guarantee programmes meet the elements of item (j).
228. What accounting principles should the Panel use in assessing the long-term operating costs and losses of these three programmes? For example, if internal US Government regulations require costs to be treated differently to generally accepted accounting principles, is it incumbent on the Panel to conduct its analysis in accordance with that treatment? BRA, USA
Brazil's Answer:
68. Item (j), interpreted according to its ordinary meaning, in its context and according to the object and purpose of the SCM and Agriculture Agreements, does not require that the Panel use any particular accounting principles to assess long-term operating costs and losses. Similarly, under item (j), it is not incumbent on the Panel to conduct its analysis in accordance with US government accounting principles, whether or not those principles adhere to GAAP. (A Panel may, however, consider it particularly persuasive that the US government' own accounting principles lead to a conclusion that premium rates are inadequate to meet the long-term operating costs and losses of the CCC guarantee programmes.) Nor is it necessary, at this stage of dispute settlement proceedings, for
92 Exhibit Bra-158 (US Department of Agriculture, Office of Inspector General, Financial and IT Operations, Audit Report, Commodity Credit Corporation's Financial Statements for Fiscal Year 2002, Audit Report No. 06401-15-FM (December 2002), Notes to the Financial Statements, p. 4)).

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-301
the Panel to arrive at a determination of the precise amount by which operating costs and losses incurred by the CCC guarantee programmes outpace premiums collected.
69. For these reasons, Brazil has offered a number of different methodologies and sets of evidence that the Panel can use to determine whether premium rates are adequate to meet the longterm operating costs and losses of the CCC guarantee programmes. Each of those methodologies or sets of evidence demonstrates that premium rates are inadequate to meet the long-term operating costs and losses of the CCC guarantee programmes.
70. One methodology is the present value accounting endorsed by the US Congress and the President in the Federal Credit Reform Act ("FCRA"). The FCRA has been translated into accounting standards for US government loan guarantees by the Federal Accounting Standards Advisory Board ("FASAB"). Consistent with the FCRA, the FASAB accounting standards state that "[f]or guaranteed loans outstanding, the present value of estimated net cash outflows of the loan guarantees is recognized as a liability."93 The FASAB standards (and the FCRA) state that "[t]he amount of the subsidy expense equals the present value of estimated cash outflows over the life of the loans minus the present value of estimated cash inflows, discounted at the interest rate of marketable Treasury securities with a similar maturity term applicable to the period during which the loans are disbursed."94
71. As one way to determine whether the long-term operating costs and losses of the programmes outpace premiums collected, Brazil has used the net subsidy expense (including reestimates) calculated using the FCRA and FASAB standards over the period 1992-2002.95 The CCC has itself adopted this methodology in its 2002 financial statements, when it lists a net subsidy expense of $411 million for all post-1991 CCC guarantees.96 Using present value accounting, CCC's 2002 financial statements also track enormous uncollectible amounts on pre-1992 and post-1991 guarantees that far outpace premiums collected for the programmes ­ by $2.3 billion on pre-1992 guarantees, and by $550 million on post-1991 guarantees.97

95 Exhibit Bra-193. 96 Exhibit Bra-158 (US Department of Agriculture, Office of Inspector General, Financial and IT Operations, Audit Report, Commodity Credit Corporation's Financial Statements for Fiscal Year 2002, Audit Report No. 06401-15-FM (December 2002), Notes to the Financial Statements, p. 19). 97 See Brazil's 11 August Answers to Questions, para. 167 (third and fourth bullet points); Brazil's 18 November Further Rebuttal Submission, para. 250; Notes to Financial Statements contained in Exhibit Bra158 (US Department of Agriculture, Office of Inspector General, Financial and IT Operations, Audit Report, Commodity Credit Corporation's Financial Statements for Fiscal Year 2002, Audit Report No 06401-15-FM (December 2002), pg. 14). Contrary to the United States' assertion at paragraph 170 of its 22 August Rebuttal Submission, for post-1991 CCC guarantees, the amounts in the "subsidy allowance" column are actually the amounts of receivables associated with post-1991 CCC guarantees that CCC considers uncollectible. Under the FCRA ­ and as confirmed above in the quote from page 4 of the CCC 2002 financial statements ­ the subsidy allowance is recorded on a net present value basis, which means that it represents the cost CCC considers it will incur on a guarantee cohort at the time that cohort is closed. The amount listed in the "subsidy allowance" column in the receivables table of CCC's 2002 financial statements for post-1991 guarantees is therefore as uncollectible as the amount listed in the "uncollectible" column of the pre-1992 CCC guarantee receivables table.

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-302
72. The Panel asks whether, if US government regulations require costs to be treated differently than they would be under generally accepted accounting principles, the Panel must conduct its analysis in accordance with that treatment. As Brazil has already noted, nothing in item (j) would require the Panel to do so. However, Brazil notes that in its 2002 financial statements, the CCC, which relies on present value accounting, states that "[t]he accounting principles and standards applied in preparing the financial statements and described in this note are in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) for Federal entities."98
73. In this dispute, the United States objects to the use of present value accounting to determine the costs of the CCC guarantee programmes, because present value accounting entails the use of "estimates."99 Apart from the fact that the FCRA does not in fact rely on "estimates" to the extent suggested by the United States,100 Brazil also notes that in other contexts, the US government is comfortable with this inherent aspect of present value accounting for loan guarantees. Present value accounting has been endorsed by the US Congress and the President in the FCRA, as well as by the FASAB, the Office of Management and Budget,101 and the General Accounting Office,102 to name a few. Finally, Brazil notes that the United States is comfortable with the Panel relying on present value accounting and some estimated data, as long as the Panel limits itself to data suggesting that CCC guarantees issued in some, carefully-selected years did not lose money.103 This is not an appropriate means of determining the performance of the "programmes," as is required by item (j).
74. Other methodologies and means of accounting for CCC's long-term operating costs and losses confirm the result reached using present value accounting. First, Brazil has constructed a methodology using actual data on income, costs and losses, which shows net losses for the CCC guarantee programmes of $1.1 billion.104 Second, defaults of more than $4 billion on CCC guarantees for exports to Iraq and Poland alone similarly demonstrate costs and losses far in excess of total CCC premiums collected.105 Third, a methodology adopted by the US General Accounting Office concluded that if GSM 102 and GSM 103 continued until 2007, costs would reach $7.6 billion, which exceeds maximum premiums collected by nearly $7.3 billion.106
75. In conclusion, item (j) does not require that the Panel use any particular accounting principles in assessing long-term operating costs and losses. Brazil has offered the Panel a number of different methodologies based on a variety of accounting principles. Each methodology confirms that premium rates are inadequate to meet the long-term operating costs and losses of the CCC guarantee programmes.

V. Serious Prejudice
229. What is the meaning of the words "may arise in any case where one or several of the following apply" (emphasis added) in Article 6.3 of the SCM Agreement? Please comment on the possibility that these words indicate that one of the Article 6 subparagraphs may not be sufficient to establish serious prejudice and that serious prejudice should be considered an additional or overriding criterion to the factors specified in the subparagraphs. BRA
Brazil's Answer:
76. The phrase "one or several" must be interpreted in its ordinary meaning. This phrase means that the conditional clause "may arise" is satisfied when one of the following applies or when more than one of the following apply. The phrase "one or several" is equivalent to: "at least one." Such a trigger is not conditioned on any other clause. In fact, this is stressed by the words "in any case" just before the phrase where one or several. Therefore, serious prejudice may be shown in any case where at least one of the subparagraphs of Article 6.3 applies.
77. Brazil disagrees with the possibility that the words one or several indicate that one of the Article 6.3 subparagraphs may not be sufficient to establish serious prejudice. Had negotiators felt that this should be the case, they certainly would have found a way to say so. This was the case, for example, in Articles 3.2 and 3.4 of the Anti-Dumping Agreement, where after the enumeration of relevant factors, the text states that no "... one or several of these factors" can "give decisive guidance." Identical language is found in the SCM Agreement itself. Article 15.4 in fine reads "... nor can one or several of these factors necessarily give decisive guidance." In SCM Article 15.7 negotiators were even more explicit, affirming that "[n]o one of these factors by itself can necessarily give decisive guidance but the totality of the factors considered must lead to the conclusion that ... ."
78. The provisions of the Anti-Dumping and SCM Agreement cited above relate to situations where a number of factors could lead to a determination of injury. Article 6.3 of the SCM Agreement is meant to address a similar situation: a list of factors could lead to a determination of serious injury. However, in stark contrast with Articles 3.2 and 3.4 of the Anti-Dumping Agreement and Articles 15.4 and 15.7 of the SCM Agreement, negotiators chose not to include reference to the possibility that, in Article 6.3, "the words one or several indicate that one of the Article 6 subparagraphs may not be sufficient to establish serious prejudice." To find so, the Panel would need to read into Article 6.3 the words found in Articles 3.2 and 3.4 of the Anti-Dumping Agreement and Articles 15.4 and 15.7 of the SCM Agreement. The Appellate Body has made clear that panels must not read into a text words that are not there.
79. The phrase "may arise in any case where one or several of the following apply" recognizes that effects of subsidies constituting serious prejudice under one of the identified paragraphs of Article 6.3 may also constitute serious prejudice under another of the identified paragraphs of Article 6.3. This case is a good example. US cotton subsidies have both increased the US world market share under Article 6.3(d) as well as suppressed world market prices and prices in third country markets under Article 6.3(c). But the existence of "serious prejudice" in this or other cases does not depend upon whether the effects of the subsidies cause one or four different types of serious prejudice.
80. In its context within Article 6, the phrase "may arise in any case where one or several of the following apply" is necessary because while the facts may demonstrate that the effects of the subsidies may create the one, two, three or four enumerated types of serious prejudice, these effects may not be actionable. For example, under Article 6.3(d), there may be an increase in the world market share for a commodity product. But it "may" not be actionable because there are specific multilaterally agreed rules for that commodity, within the meaning of footnote 17. Further,

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-304
Article 6.7 of the SCM Agreement creates exemptions from serious prejudice findings even if the requirements of Article 6.3 would be fulfilled. These situations include export prohibitions by the complaining Member, force majeure, arrangements that limit exports, or the failure to conform to standards and regulatory requirements. Article 6.9 of the SCM Agreement covers another situation in which the "may" language would be applicable. It exempts serious prejudice that exists even where the requirements of Article 6.3 are fulfilled because the subsidies are exempt from action by virtue of the peace clause of Article 13 of the Agreement on Agriculture.
230. Please comment on Brazil's views on Article 6.3 of the SCM Agreement as stated in paragraphs 92-94 of its further submission. USA
231. Do you believe that the now-expired Article 6.1 and/or Annex IV of the SCM Agreement are relevant context for the Panel's interpretation of Article 6.3? USA
232. How, if at all, should the Panel take into account the effects of other factors in its analysis of the effects of US subsidies under Article 6.3? If the Panel should compare the effects of other factors to establish the relative significance of one compared to others, how would this be done? What would be relevant "factors" for this purpose? BRA
Brazil's Answer:
81. Brazil divides its response to this question into two parts. First, Brazil will discuss Article 6.3(c), and, second, Brazil will discuss Article 6.3(d).
82. Concerning Article 6.3(c), the Panel can and should, to the extent it is relevant to do so, take into account the effects of non-subsidy related factors in its analysis of the price-suppressing effects of US subsidies. The only "other factors" identified by the United States include demand-related factors the United States claims contributed to lower cotton prices in MY 1999-2002 including weak cotton demand, flat retail consumption, falling world incomes, increasing US textile imports, and China's releasing of stocks.107 The United States further claimed that US production-related factors accounted for increased US production including boll weevil eradication, higher yielding GMO cotton, and lower prices of alternative crops.108
83. Brazil addressed all of these "other" factors in earlier submissions and demonstrated that while some of the so-called other factors no doubt influenced prices, many of them either were factually incorrect (i.e., not "other factors") or could not have had the effect claimed by the United States.109 Brazil further demonstrated that Professor Sumner's analysis took account of all the "other" factors identified by the United States. Professor Sumner stated:
The baseline is calibrated to reproduce the acreage, production, exports, prices and other variables that actually applied between the marketing years 1999-2001, the period over which data was available at the time the baseline was developed. By calibrating the baseline to actual data for the recent past, the model incorporates all the factors that have determined the situation of the cotton market during this period.
The United States has highlighted some of these factors. In their Further Submission they discuss developments in the synthetic fiber market, such as prices of polyester; Chinese stock releases, exchange rate movements, global and US macroeconomic

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-305
conditions, and technical changes in cotton production that reduce costs, such as boll weevil eradication and release of genetically modified cotton varieties. Remember, my model is calibrated to reproduce actual cotton market data for the historical period. Hence, my model incorporates all these historical factors into the baseline from which I analyze the impact of removing cotton subsidies.110
84. The econometric evidence presented by Brazil ­ including the studies by USDA economists Westcott and Price, Professor Sumner, and Professor Ray of the University of Tennessee, among others ­ separate out the effects of the US subsidies from the effects of all other supply and demand factors that impact on the upland cotton market. In effect, these studies are designed precisely to answer the question posed by the Panel. The results of these studies sift through the "other factors" to isolate for the effects of the US subsidies. Professor Sumner has conservatively estimated that AIndex prices would on average be 12.6 per cent or 6.5 cents per pound higher without the US subsidizing upland cotton production, use and exports. The other econometric simulation models find that cotton prices are suppressed to a significant degree regardless of whether other factors push upland cotton prices up or down.
85. It bears repeating that Brazil has not claimed in this dispute that the entire decline in upland cotton prices during MY 1999-2002 was due to the effects of US subsidies. Brazil's argument has been all along that but for the US subsidies upland cotton prices would be higher by a significant degree, whether prices rise or fall. Thus, for example, the fact that Chinese release of stocks may have lowered world prices in MY 2000-2001 to a certain extent is entirely consistent with Brazil's evidence and its proof. Brazil demonstrated that actual market prices in MY 1999-2002 would have been higher to a significant degree but for the US subsidies.
86. Thus, the Panel can and should take "other factors" into account. But the record shows that there is no legitimate basis to conclude that "other" supply and demand factors collectively (a) accounted for all of the declines in prices during the period of investigation or (b) meant that prices went as high as they would have even if no US subsidies had been provided.
87. Brazil's claim under Article 6.3(d) concerns the development of actual world market share data. This world market share is the result of several key factors including US subsidies, weather effects in many countries, and exchange rate effects. However, Brazil has demonstrated that the US subsidies were a major contributing factor behind the increase in the US world market share, which occurred even when prices were falling and the US dollar increased in value. Professor Sumner has conservatively estimated that without the US subsidies, US exports would be on average 41.2 per cent lower during MY 1999-2002.111 The US upland cotton farmers' long-term cost of production gap between market revenue and total costs of $872 per acre for over 14.38 million acres during MY 1997-2002 (or $12.5 billion) fully supports Professor Sumner's analysis.112
88. It follows that the US world market share would be much lower absent the US subsidies. As an example, based on Exhibit Bra-302, Brazil has calculated out the effects of a 41.2 per cent decline in US exports as estimated by Professor Sumner for MY 2002.113 In this example, US world market shares for MY 1999-2001 remain unchanged.114 The results are as follows:
110 Exhibit Bra-279 (Statement of Professor Sumner ­ 7 October 2003, paras. 13-14). 111 Brazil's 9 September Further Submission, Annex I, Table I.5a. 112 Brazil's 3 December Closing Statement, para. 13. 113 This calculation assumes that total world trade would not be affected if US subsidies were not provided. 114 Brazil emphasizes that also for these years there are strong export-enhancing effects of the US subsidies, but has assumed for this exercise that they had no effects on US world market share.

89. This graph shows that in MY 2002, US exports would have fallen and remained below their previous three-year average without the US subsidies for that year. In other words, but for the 2002 US subsidies, there would have been a reduction in US world market share, not an increase.115 This analysis also demonstrates that while there may have been other factors at work stimulating US exports (such as reduced domestic US demand for upland cotton), these factors were not enough to cause an increase in US world market share over the previous 3 year period as required by Article 6.3(d).

233. In Brazil's view, what is or are the "same market(s)" for the purposes of Article 6.3(c)? Does Brazil's view of "world market" imply that regardless of which domestic (or other) "market" is examined, price suppression will be identifiable? BRA
Brazil's Answer:
90. The "same market(s)" for the purposes of Brazil's price suppression claims under Article 6.3(c) are (1) the world market for upland cotton, (2) the Brazilian market, (3) the US market, and (4) 40 third country markets116 where Brazil exports its cotton. US and Brazilian "like" upland cotton is found in each of these markets.

91. The record establishes that there is a "world market" for upland cotton and that the prices for that market are reflected in the New York futures prices and in the A-Index prices.117 Brazil established that there is a global price discovery mechanism that reflects the "world market price," which is heavily influenced by world market supply and demand factors, including the US subsidies.118 These "world market prices," in turn, are transmitted to the US market, the Brazilian market, and to the 40 other markets where both Brazilian and US subsidized cottons are marketed as typical commodities.119
92. In response to the Panel's question whether the world market prices that Brazil claims are suppressed are also "identifiable" in the "domestic (or other) `market,'" the answer is "yes." The evidence of the transmission of the global effects to these other markets includes (1) USDA's own data for the US prices received by US producers,120 (2) USDA volume and value data for US exports to third countries,121 (3) Brazilian Government volume and value data for Brazilian exports to 40 countries,122 (4) Brazilian ESALQ Index data regarding internal Brazilian prices,123 (5) data from various third countries reflecting upland cotton import prices,124 and (6) data from several third countries reflecting their domestic prices for upland cotton.125 In addition, Brazil has presented the evidence of Andrew Macdonald and Christopher Ward who testified concerning the importance of the A-Index. Brazil further includes the views of Gerald Estur, the ICAC's chief statistician, as set out below.126
93. A-Index world prices are a useful benchmark by which to judge whether prices for upland cotton traded internationally or even within domestic markets are influenced by global world market forces.127 While the New York futures prices play a major role in influencing markets, the short term volatility of the futures market makes comparison with monthly or annual export prices more difficult. Andrew Macdonald indicated that "the price oscillations of the A and B-Index are much less pronounced than the futures market, but in the longer term they accompany the signs and trends coming from the futures market."128 Moreover, the US Government uses the A-Index as a key basis for Step 2 and marketing loan payments. Professor Sumner's model adapted from the FAPRI model used actual A-Index prices for the period MY 1999-2001 and the "world price" simulation effects are estimated "A-Index" prices.129
94. Organized below is the evidence on pricing data supporting the link between A-Index prices that reflect the global supply and demand influences (including effects of the US subsidies) and prices in "other markets" as posed in the Panel's question.

export prices to 40 different countries, based on official published US and Brazilian Government sources. It then provides (based on availability) information concerning the import prices of all imports from certain of the 40 countries where both Brazil and US upland cotton was exported during MY 1999-2002. Finally, Brazil presents information of internal domestic prices in the United States, Brazil, and China. Brazilian and US Export Prices 95. In response to the Panel's question, Brazil first presents evidence of US and Brazilian export prices to 40 different markets where both Brazilian and US upland cotton was exported at some point during MY 1999-2002. The information and evidence below is based on a compilation from two sources. First, all information on US upland cotton export prices is based on the "US Trade Internet System," a web application run by USDA's Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS).130 Second, information on Brazilian upland cotton export prices is taken from information published and maintained the Brazilian Ministry of Agriculture on its public web-site.131 The export "prices" represent the declared contract value of the upland cotton at the US and Brazilian port of export ­ known as "Free Alongside Ship (FAS)" values.132 96. The first way to examine the available data is to view it collectively similar to what the United States did in Exhibit US-75. The first graph below examines the cumulative Brazilian and US export prices in MY 1999-2002 covering exports to the 40 markets where Brazil exports its upland cotton as well as US exports to Brazil.133
130 See http://www.fas.usda.gov/ustrade/. The four upland cotton HS-10 codes used are 5201001010, 5201001020, 5201001025 and 5201001090. All data originally in tons and dollars, was converted into pounds and cents.
131 See http://alicewebl.desenvolvimento.gov.br; www.mdic.gov.br/indicadores/balanca/balanca.html. See also Exhibit Bra-383 (Brazil and US Export Data on Export Quantities and Values by Country). All Brazilian data originally provided in kilograms and dollars was converted into pounds and cents.
132 The FAS value includes all inland freight, insurance and other charges incurred in placing the merchandise alongside the carrier at shipping or insurance costs.

In addition, as discussed in greater detail in the answer to Question 235, Brazilian prices are at times equal to, slightly greater than US prices or slightly lower than US prices.

98. The Brazilian export data can be used as a proxy for third country market prices in a handful
of countries where there were extensive Brazilian exports. This is illustrated in the cases of three of
the larger markets for Brazilian exports ­ Argentina, India, and Portugal as set out in the graph below:134

United States

A-Index

100. Brazil presents in Exhibit Bra-383 the underlying data on all 40 of the markets where Brazil and the United States export their upland cotton. This underlying data is presented in a variety of different graphs; one set compares Brazilian exports to the A-Index;136 another compares US exports to the A-Index,137 and a third combines Brazilian and US export prices.138
101. Many of the 40 markets show only very limited amounts of Brazilian exports. Compared to the volume of US exports, Brazilian exports during MY 1999-2002 were relatively small (representing approximately 1 per cent of total world market share).139 Thus, when the monthly export data is examined on a country-by-country basis, there are very few third country markets where Brazil exported in each of the 48 months in MY 19999-2002, i.e., where there is a complete set of 48 data points. Nevertheless, even the limited data points for each of the 40 countries shows that Brazilian export prices generally tracked A-Index prices.
102. Many of the graphs also reflect fairly widely ranging data point prices, particularly where the import volumes are not very great.140 By contrast, country markets with very high volumes of imports141 tend to have much more stable import prices that closely follow the A-Index. This is why the US high-volume import data graphs provide reliable evidence of pricing trends in some of the 40 country markets examined. There are various reasons that explain the widely ranging pricing data points. First, while US and Brazilian cottons may have the same staple length, their quality may differ significantly which, in turn, impacts their respective price.142 For example, California A-Index cotton is consistently sold at a premium in world markets because its superior quality allows it to be

Examples are Belgium, Pakistan,
South Africa. 141 See Exhibit Bra-387 (Brazil Export Prices v A-Index by Country). Examples are Argentina, China,
India, Italy, Portugal, Philippines, Thailand. 142 Brazil's 9 September Further Submission, Annex II (Statement of Andrew Macdonald, paras 9-10).

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-314
used in production of finer cotton fabric.143 During certain period between MY 1999-2002, both Brazil and the United States exported cotton with a high staple length or a particularly good quality to a third country market, resulting in higher prices. This no doubt accounts for much higher US prices compared to Brazilian cotton in some markets such as France, Germany, and Portugal.
103. Second, smaller monthly export sales to a third country market with relatively few imports may result in much higher prices than large volume sales to large importers. Larger consuming countries (with larger consumers) can demand volume price premiums and sellers can export at higher volumes and lower prices based on economies of scale. The country data of the world's largest importers such as China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Indonesia, for example, closely match A-Index price trends.144 But even larger importing countries data reflects an occasional month where prices diverge from the overall trend. This may be due to the fact that smaller shipments were purchased quickly on a spot basis at higher prices.
104. Third, some exports or forward contracts for export sales are fixed-price contracts, which may be executed months before export takes place.145 For example, a yarn spinner or textile producer in Brazil may contract to purchase 100 tons of US cotton on 1 January 2002 at an import price fixed at 40 cents per pound at that date, but when the cotton is actually exported on 1 June 2002 the A-Index price may be 50 cents. This type of contract with terms fixed at execution rather than on delivery may explain a number of country market graphs where there is a delayed reaction of the country price to declines or increases in the A-Index prices. However, even where there is a delay in response, the longer-term trends in most markets thereafter track the downward or upward climb of A-Index prices.
105. But even with the limitations in the monthly data for individual country markets, the data on the whole strongly supports the conclusion that world prices do influence local export market prices. Any anomalies in smaller importing country markets are notably eliminated by using the weighted average analysis of monthly data from all 40 markets where Brazil and US cotton exports are found. With the vast bulk of US ­ and most of Brazilian cotton ­ being exported to large volume markets, the combined analysis shows the close relationship between A-Index prices and both Brazilian and US prices. Indeed, the Chief Statistician of the ICAC, who has extensive experience with individual country and world market pricing data, came to the following conclusions:
For all importing non-producing countries, domestic prices follow the Cotlook A Index, taking into account appropriate location and quality differentials and the quality differential for the particular type of cotton needed by the spinning industry.
Prices of imported cotton in producing countries also follow the Cotlook A Index, with appropriate location and quality differentials. The international market for raw cotton is relatively open, with rather low imports taxes (averaging less than 5 per cent. The US having one of the highest).

As a result, the average price of imports (value divided by quantity) for a specific period is not directly related to prevailing market prices.").

Domestic prices of cotton produced and consumed locally are influenced by the supply and demand situation in the country but are not disconnected from international prices.146 Individual Country Market Import Price Data 106. Additional evidence responsive to the Panel's question is found in various third country market import pricing data that was collected since 9 December 2003 by Brazilian embassies around the world. The data and the graphs are set out in Exhibit Bra-384. This data is available in two forms: (1) monthly import data from all sources, and (2) annual import data from all sources. While this information is not available to Brazil for many of the 40 export market countries, the available evidence confirms the other third country market data discussed above. 107. Monthly import data is available from Argentina, Ecuador, Hong Kong, Japan, Spain, Thailand, and the Ukraine. The data generally shows a close relationship between the movement of import prices and the movement of the A-Index.

The monthly data for these countries reflects fairly high-volume imports from all worldwide sources. The higher volumes guarantee a more accurate reflection of the bulk of prices within these countries. The link between A-Index and import prices is also confirmed by the data for Argentina, Thailand and the Ukraine in Exhibit Bra-384.

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-318
108. There is also annual import data available from a few countries. While annual data does not provide as detailed information concerning price movements within a year, it also supports a link between the A-Index and import prices. These import prices, in turn, serve as a proxy for prices in the third country market generally. For example, the available import data from China, Chile, and the United Kingdom is set forth below:147

Individual Country Domestic Prices
109. Finally, Brazil presents a series of graphs showing domestic prices in those countries for which domestic prices were available. Andrew Macdonald has indicated that most countries do not collect or maintain accessible data on domestic upland cotton prices. This was confirmed by the requests for such data by Brazilian embassies around the world. Therefore, Brazil can only offer information on domestic prices from a limited number of countries. These countries, however, constitute key markets, including the United States, China, Brazil and Pakistan.
110. The record shows that domestic prices within several key producing countries including the United States, Brazil, China and Pakistan also reflect and generally move with the overall trends of AIndex prices. This is shown in the graphs below:148

Conclusion
113. The evidence outlined above and in Brazil's earlier submissions shows that world market prices were transmitted to other markets during MY 1999-2002, and that this continues today. Whether the data is viewed collectively or individually, the data generally shows that Brazilian, US and other exporters' prices to these 42 countries are consistent with movements and trends in the AIndex price. While there are some (particularly low volume) graphs that show monthly differences from A-Index trends or movements, Brazil has set forth the quality, contract, and timing factors accounting for such anomalies. The collective statistical evidence supports the conclusion of the ICAC's chief statistician that "[a]ctual prices of imported cotton, in non-producing as well as in producing countries, are based on the Cotlook A Index or on the New York futures" and "the prices of the major types of cotton ... are affected by the supply and demand situation facing the market as a whole."152 All of this evidence is consistent with the conclusion that these third country market prices are heavily influenced by A-Index and New York futures prices. Professor Sumner analysis and the studies by USDA economists undeniably show that the US subsidies have suppressed A-Index and New York futures prices. Since these indices are the benchmarks for prices in those "same markets" where US and Brazilian upland cotton were exported, it is indisputable that the US subsidies have suppressed the prices in each of the "markets" cited in the introductory paragraph of Brazil's answer to this question.
234. Does "significant" price suppression under Article 6.3(c) necessarily amount to "serious" prejudice within the meaning of Article 5(c)? Could the level of "significance" of any price suppression under Article 6.3(c) determine whether any prejudice under Article 5(c) rises to the level of "serious prejudice"? USA, BRA
Brazil's Answer:
114. In response to both questions, Brazil, New Zealand, and Argentina have argued previously that whether price suppression is "significant" cannot be judged solely by reference to a non-textually based "objective" amount of price suppression.153 Rather, the "significance" of price suppression must be assessed with reference to the quality of the impacts of whatever level of price suppression exists on the producers of the like product. For example, a panel could find that even large amounts of price suppression are not "significant" where the complaining party producers had de minimis production, or no exports, and/or that the total value of lost revenue from suppressed prices was minimal. On the other hand, very large producers of a commodity product like upland cotton would suffer serious prejudice from even smaller "objective" levels of price suppression in terms of the amount of lost revenue.
115. The Panel's question really comes down to whether Article 6.3 of the SCM Agreement requires a two step process ­ first, an objective finding of an amount of price suppression that is "significant," and second, whether the complaining party Member suffers serious prejudice from such "significant" levels of price suppression. Brazil does not believe the text requires such a two-step process for the reasons outlined above and in previous submissions. However, the facts of this case show that even if such a test were required, the amount of price suppression caused by the US subsidies is significant and far from de minimis. Brazil has also submitted undisputed evidence that its producers have suffered considerable losses in revenue from suppressed prices that could have

been used for further investment in high-yielding lower cost production.154 By any measure, this evidence establishes both "significance" of the price suppression and "serious prejudice" to the interests of Brazil.
235. Please comment on paragraphs 8, 9 and 10 of the US 2 December oral statement, in particular, why the average Brazilian price is shown as lower than the average US price. BRA
Brazil's Answer:
116. Brazil previously has set forth its reasoning why evidence of lower Brazilian prices in some markets is irrelevant to the issue of whether or not all the prices in those markets were suppressed by the global effects of US subsidies.155 This global price transferral mechanism is and remains the relevant analysis of Brazil's Article 6.3(c) price suppression claim as Brazil has outlined in its Answer to Question 233. Brazil sets forth its comments and rebuttal to paragraphs 8, 9 and 10 of the US 2 December Oral Statement and Exhibit US-75 below.
Cumulative Analysis of 8 Country Export Prices
117. With respect to the US "price undercutting" argument, and in particular the US chart set out in Exhibit US-75, the factual assertion that cumulative US prices in the 8 countries examined are consistently much higher than Brazilian prices is simply wrong. One fundamental error with Exhibit US-75 is that the United States did not "weight-average" the data regarding export prices for Argentina, Bolivia, Italy, Philippines, Portugal, Indonesia, Paraguay and India. Rather, Exhibit US-75 is based on a simple average, not taking into account whether Brazilian shipments on a monthly basis were 2 tons or US shipments the same month were 100,000 tons. In addition, the US chart (and accompanying data) in Exhibit US-75 provides no volumes on monthly shipments, provides no published backup material, uses a non-public source of information, and inexplicably does not use official USDA Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS) published data on export prices.
118. Using the proper monthly weighted average methodology and FAS's own official export pricing data together with the Brazilian Government's official export pricing data,156 the collective situation in the eight countries examined in Exhibit US-75 looks completely different than the US chart in that exhibit:

US Weighted Average

Brazil Weighted Average

119. The graph shows that US and Brazilian prices fluctuate with Brazilian prices at times higher than US prices and US prices higher than Brazilian prices at other times. The chart shows that beginning in November 2000, US prices plunged along with the A-Index prices and that Brazilian prices quickly followed, with both US and Brazilian prices remaining at record lows until near the end of 2002 when both started rising again. Finally, the chart shows that US prices generally followed the movements or trends in A-Index prices (the solid line in the graph). As discussed in Brazil's Answer to Question 233, this is what is relevant for a price suppression claim under Article 6.3(c) as opposed to any alleged "undercutting" by Brazilian cotton in individual markets as the US claims.
Cumulative Analysis of US and Brazilian Prices in 40 Third-Country Markets
120. Moving beyond the 8 countries in Exhibit US-75 to all 41 countries (including Brazil) where Brazil and the US both sold at least some upland cotton between MY 1999-2002 further demonstrates the absence of so-called "price undercutting" by Brazilian products as alleged by the United States. For the period MY 1999-2002, the weighted average price covering a total of 10.5 billion pounds of US upland cotton exported to these same 41 countries (including Brazil) is 45.33 cents per pound.157 By contrast, the average weighted price of 709 million pounds of exported Brazilian upland cotton to 40 export markets is 44.65 cents per pound.158 This is a difference of 0.68 cents per pound. For marketing year 2001 ­ the year when prices plunged to record lows ­ the weighted average price of US upland cotton in all markets where Brazilian cotton was also exported was 38.83 cents per pound while Brazilian weighted average prices to the same markets was significantly higher at 44.05 cents per pound.159 Brazilian prices were lower than US prices during MY 2000 and 2002, but were higher than US prices in MY 1999.160 This is hardly evidence of "price undercutting" by Brazilian upland cotton.

122. This graph illustrates the absolute closeness of prices between Brazilian and US prices, particularly after mid-2001. But it also shows very similar movements in prices between Brazilian and US exports. And, as discussed in Brazil's Answer to Question 233, these similar movements are further evidence of the influence of the global pricing mechanisms on prices received by US and Brazilian exporters in third country markets.
Individual Third-Country Analysis of Brazilian and US Export Prices
123. When US and Brazilian prices in the 40 individual markets are examined, the evidence does not support the United States' broad assertion that Brazilian prices are consistently lower than US prices. In some of the key textile producing countries where US exporters ship large quantities of US upland cotton ­ Hong Kong, Taiwan, India, Pakistan, and Vietnam ­ US prices during MY 1999-2002 were lower than Brazilian prices.162
124. In other large consuming (textile producing) countries, while US prices were somewhat higher than Brazilian prices, the volume of US exports vastly exceeded the volume of Brazilian exports, including China (120 times greater), Bangladesh (26 times greater), Colombia (9 times greater), Indonesia (17 times greater), Japan (35 times greater), Korea (3384 times greater), and Peru (631 times greater).163 Huge volumes of US exports in these 7 markets compared to the volumes of Brazilian exports suggest that US exports, not Brazilian exports, play a dominating role in the conditions of competition in those markets.

161 Exhibit Bra-386 (Brazil and US Export Price by Country). 162 A complete set of graphs for each of the 40 countries country markets and the underlying data are
set forth in Exhibit Bra-383 (Brazil and US Export Data on Export Quantities and Values by Country) and
Exhibit Bra-386 (Brazil and US Export Prices by Country). 163 Exhibit Bra-383 (Brazil and US Export Data on Export Quantities and Values by Country).

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-327
125. Indeed, overall, the cumulative volume of US exports to the 40 countries where Brazilian exports were shipped was 15 times greater than the volume of Brazilian exports.164 For Brazilian exports to secure any sales, let alone increase market share in competition with heavily subsidized US exports in these markets, it would not be surprising that textile consumers of upland cotton would expect Brazilian exporters to discount their prices. Andrew Macdonald confirmed that such discount pricing was necessary for non-Brazilian cottons to compete with US cotton.165 This is particularly true in Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Indonesia, Peru, South Korea, Turkey and Venezuela where US exporters received the benefit of US export credit guarantees.166 No exporter of non-US cotton could hope to compete with those export credits without discounting its upland cotton prices.167
126. But even where the volume of Brazilian exports was greater than US exports, the evidence does not suggest the absence of overall price suppression from the effects of US subsidies.168 Brazilian exports were greater than US exports in only 10 of the 40 countries (Argentina, Bolivia, Cuba, Poland, France, Germany, Greece, Portugal, South Africa, and Spain) over the MY 1999-2002 period. These 10 countries represented a tiny fraction ­ 0.49 per cent ­ of total US exports during MY 1999-2002 to the 41 countries, and only 37.5 per cent of Brazilian exports.169 Yet, even without significant US exports to these countries, the domestic prices of these countries still largely followed A-Index prices, as discussed in Brazil's Answer to Question 233.
127. Further, in the 10 countries where the volume of Brazilian exports was larger than the United States, Brazilian prices were higher than US prices in 3 of the 10 countries ­ Poland, Greece, and South Africa.170 Further, US prices in 4 of the 10 countries ­ France, Germany, Spain, and Portugal ­ were much higher than Brazilian prices.171 The very low volume of US exports to these same four countries suggests that far higher quality US cotton was sold in these countries which produce low-volume specialized cotton textile products.172 Finally, US and Brazilian prices were very close in remaining 3 countries ­ Argentina, Bolivia, and Cuba.173 Thus, contrary to the US arguments, this evidence does not suggest that Brazilian prices are suppressing US prices, even in those markets where there are larger volumes of Brazilian imports.
128. Similarly, the unqualified US assertion that "the Brazilian A-Index quote is consistently below the US A-Index quote"174 is both untrue as well as irrelevant to the question of whether US production subsidies caused suppression of world and third country market prices. Comparing US Memphis A-Index prices with Brazil A-Index prices shows the following graph:175

129. As the Panel can see from the graph, since October of 2001, the US Memphis A-Index price has been slightly higher or slightly lower than the Brazilian A-Index price.176 But throughout the entire period, the movements of both US Memphis and Brazilian A-Index prices track each other very closely.177 This is the key fact illustrating the transmission of global price-suppressing effects as discussed in Answer to Question 233 supra.
Domestic Prices for Brazil, US and China
130. Nor does the record support the US claim that Brazilian prices undercut US export prices to the Brazilian market. Indeed, the evidence suggests the opposite. More than 90 per cent of Brazilian production of upland cotton was sold in Brazil during MY 1999-2002.178 Imports represented approximately 20 per cent of Brazilian consumption during MY 1999-2002.179 US exports to Brazil represented 21 per cent of Brazilian imports with a total of 306 million pounds of US upland cotton exported to Brazil180 in MY 1999-2002.181 US annual weighted average export prices to Brazil were lower in every year except MY 2000 when US exports volumes fell to very low levels.182 Significantly, in MY 1999, when US export volumes to Brazil represented 17.6 per cent of very large Brazilian imports of upland cotton, the US weighted average prices were 10.27 cents below Brazilian domestic prices.183 Similarly, in MY 2002, when US exports represented 50 per cent of total Brazilian imports, US export prices were 4.57 cents per pound lower than Brazilian domestic
176 The US comparison between the Brazilian quote and the California/Arizona quote is misleading given the much higher quality of the latter cotton, as discussed above.

prices.184 This evidence confirms the testimony of Andrew Macdonald that Brazilian textile purchases of cotton used, inter alia, US imports ­ or the threat of US imports ­ to negotiate lower Brazilian domestic prices during MY 1999-2002.185 It may also be an effect of US GSM 102 export credit guarantees. And this evidence further confirms the price suppressing effects of US subsidies in the Brazilian market.
Conclusion
131. The evidence set out above refutes the inappropriate non-weighted average analysis in Exhibit US-75, and confirms the effects of the US subsidies in each market where Brazil and the US upland cotton were found in MY 1999-2002. Any "competition" between US and Brazilian cottons took place against the background of subsidy-distorted marketplaces. In the final analysis, the fact that selected US prices are higher186 or lower in the A-Index or in individual third country markets is largely irrelevant to the question whether US subsidies are causing significant price suppression "in the same market" where US and Brazilian cotton is marketed. Rather, as Brazil has established, it is the impact of the US subsidies on the global supply and demand factors that suppresses prices in the world market as well as in the third countries where upland cotton is marketed. This means that the prices in each of those 40 third country markets ­ as well as the Brazilian and US markets ­ were already suppressed before any cotton was shipped by US or Brazilian exporters.
132. Finally, the generalized price-suppression effect manifests itself in all 42 individual country markets187 in which Brazilian upland cotton is consumed. Professor Sumner estimates that over 40 per cent of US upland cotton exports during MY 1999-2002 would not have been made but for the US subsidies.188 Forty per cent fewer US exports necessarily means lower, or even non-existent, US exports in many of the 40 markets where Brazil exported its upland cotton. Had significant volumes of US upland cotton not received Step 2 export payments, US exports and, thus, the amount of US upland cotton competing with Brazilian cottons would have been lower. Similarly, far fewer bids of US upland cotton financed by the GSM 102 programme may well have meant higher prices for Brazilian exporters and/or an expanded market share in each of these markets.

Brazil's Answer:
133. In responding to this question, Brazil starts from the ordinary meaning of the term "consistent trend." A "trend" means "a general course, tendency or drift."189 "Consistent" means "congruous, compatible with, not contradictory, marked by uniformity or regularity."190 A consistent trend within the meaning of Article 6.3(d) therefore means a non-contradictory tendency marked by regularity.
134. Generally, a phenomenon that remains at approximately the same level could be considered a consistent trend. However, read in the context of Article 6.3(d), which speaks of an "increase that follows a consistent trend over a period when subsidies have been granted," the consistent trend must reflect the increase in the world market share of a Member over its previous three-year average. Thus, for a given period of time, the world market share of a Member could remain at approximately the same level and be compatible with a finding of a consistent trend. Yet, there will not be a consistent trend, within the meaning of Article 6.3(d), if during the final year there is no increase of a Member's world market share over its previous three-year average. It follows that over the period when subsidies have been granted there must be a regular tendency of an increase in the world market share of a Member ­ although no increase in each and every year is required for the conditions of Article 6.3(d) to be fulfilled.
135. This interpretation is confirmed by the scope of Article 6.3(d), which applies to primary products or commodities. The parties agree that this includes agricultural products that necessarily will be affected by favourable or adverse weather conditions. The United States, for example, repeatedly asserts that the weather-related problems of MY 1998 mean that data for that year should be disregarded. These weather-related effects alone could cause in particular years the world market share of a Member to increase or decrease. This may well be the reasoning behind requiring examination of a longer trend in Article 6.3(d). But to require a constant increase in the world market share during each year "when subsidies have been granted" would render the disciplines of Article 6.3(d) largely inutile for agricultural products faced with weather-related production fluctuations.
136. Brazil has offered data on the US world market share over the period since MY 1996 as well as since MY 1986.191 The data shows that the trendline for the US world market share increases whether based on MY 1996 or MY 1986 as the starting point. The Panel's question asks for guidance on the conditions for a finding whether this trend is consistent.
137. Brazil cautious that statistical methods may not be helpful in analyzing the consistency of a trend within the meaning of Article 6.3(d) for two reasons: first, Article 6.3(d) is concerned with yearly data over a relatively short period. That means that only very few data points will be available, which will affect the statistical significance of any results. Second, as discussed above, it is the nature of world market shares in agricultural products to fluctuate due to weather-related effects. This phenomenon tends to further weaken any statistical significance of methods analyzing the consistency of a trend.
138. With these considerations in mind, Brazil suggests that the Panel analyze the trendlines offered by Brazil192 and decide whether on their face they demonstrate ­ as Brazil has argued ­ a trend consistent with a finding that the effect of the subsidies is an increase in the US world market share for upland cotton. Brazil believes they do, particularly if the severe MY 1998 decline is disregarded.

The R2 ­ the measure for the fit of a regression analysis ­ varies between 0.44 for MY 1986-2003 and 0.60 for MY 1996-2003. The R2 demonstrate that there is a positive relationship between the US
world market share and its increase over time. In view of the limited number of observations and the
nature of the commodity market in question, this is a very high number.

238. According to the US interpretation of the term "world market share":
(a) should the domestic consumption of closed markets be added into the denominator?
(b) if US production and consumption increased by the same percentage, whilst the rest of the world's production and consumption remained steady, would this imply an increase in the US "world market share" by a different percentage?
(c) does Saudi Arabia have a small world market share for oil? USA
239. How does the US respond to Brazil's assertions that, under the US interpretation of the term "world market share":
(a) there would be no WTO disciplines on production-enhancing subsidies that increase a Member's world market share of exports? (see paragraph 64 of Brazil's 2 December oral statement);
(b) a Member's exports would have to be disregarded in calculating their "world market share" in terms of "world consumption"? (see e.g. paragraph 65 of Brazil's 2 December oral statement) USA
240. Does Article XVI:3 of GATT 1994 provide context in interpreting Article 6.3(d) of the SCM Agreement? Do these provisions apply separately? If not, could it indicate that "world market share" is intended to mean the same as "share of world export trade"? USA
241. How does the US reconcile its data on consumption for 2002 in US Exhibit 40, Table 1 with the "consumption" data it refers to in its 30 September submission, paragraph 34, Exhibit US-47 or US-71? USA
242. How much of the benefits of PFC, MLA, CCP and Direct Payments go to land owners? If not all of the benefits go to land owners, what proportion goes to producers? USA
243. Can the Panel assume that any support at all, even marketing loan programme payments, benefits upland cotton if an upland cotton producer has other agricultural production besides upland cotton? USA
244. What proportion of the 2000 cottonseed payments benefited producers of upland cotton, given that payments were made to first handlers, who were only obliged to share them with the producer to the extent that the revenue from sale of the cottonseed was shared with the producer? (see 7 CFR §1427.1104(c) in Exhibit US-15). BRA
Brazil's Answer:
140. Brazil does not know "what proportion of the 2000 cottonseed payments" were paid directly to producers of upland cotton by first handlers. Any such information would be within the exclusive control of USDA. Therefore, Brazil looks forward to the United States providing this information in its 19 January comments.
141. However, there is evidence that the MY 2000 cottonseed payments ­ together with the MY 1999 and MY 2002 payments ­ benefited upland cotton producers either directly or indirectly. First, producers who ginned their own cotton received payments directly as "first handlers." But even producers who did not gin their own cotton received indirect benefits because the purpose and effect of the subsidy was to prevent producers from having to pay more for ginning because of low

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-334
cottonseed prices. This was made clear by the official USDA announcement of the USDA Secretary Glickman in announcing the MY 2000 cottonseed payments:
Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman announced today that USDA will propose to pay cotton farmers and ginners about $74 million to help offset losses from low 1999crop cottonseed prices.
Because of those low prices, many gins were unable to meet operating expenses normally covered by cottonseed revenues and some cotton farmers had to pay higher ginning costs," Glickman said. "This discretionary programme will help farmers make up this lost income."
The proposed payments would be made to cotton gins based on seed tonnage produced from the 1999 crops of upland and Extra Long Staple cotton. USDA plans to propose that gins share cottonseed programme payments with cotton farmers commensurate with any increased 1999-crop ginning charges as a condition of accepting programme payments.194
142. This analysis makes it clear that upland cotton producers in MY 1999-2000 were required to pay more for ginning when cottonseed prices fell because ginning companies accept as part of the payment for ginning the cottonseed produced from the ginning process of raw cotton. The benefits of the cottonseed programme to producers explains why the NCC strongly supported the "the establishment of a permanent programme for cottonseed" during the debate for the 2002 FSRI Act.195 In testimony before Congress, the Chairman of the NCC stated as follows:
Cottonseed is a critical component of total farm revenue generated from cotton production. From 1994-1998, cottonseed accounted for approximately 13 per cent of the total value of cotton production, averaging $58 per acre. Unfortunately cottonseed prices weakened significantly in 1999 as a result of weak crushing demand ads well as low oilseed prices. Cottonseed values remain well below those of previous years. The special cottonseed payment authorized by Congress for the 1999 and 2000 marketing years were vitally important on boosting producer income and helping to maintain the industry's ginning infrastructure.196
143. Finally, the importance of cottonseed payments to producers is further demonstrated by comparing the costs of ginning to the value of cottonseed. This is illustrated in the graph below:197
194 Exhibit Bra-390 ("Glickman Proposes Cottonseed Payment Programme," USDA News Release, 29 February 2000) (emphasis and underlining added).

197 This graph is based on per pound figures for the value of cottonseed and the cost of ginning per pound of cotton lint produced as calculated from Exhibit Bra-323 (Costs and Returns of US Upland Cotton Farmers, MY 1997-2002). They calculated figures are reproduced in Exhibit Bra-391 (Cost of Ginning and Value of Cottonseed per Pound of Cotton Lint).

144. This graph shows that producers were the primary beneficiaries of the cottonseed programme.
When cottonseed prices declined in MY 1999, ginning costs exceeded cottonseed prices by 2.18 cents per pound of cotton lint.198 This gap between ginning costs and cottonseed prices totalled $170.5 million.199 Congress authorized $185 million in cottonseed payments in MY 2000200, which
covered much of the MY 1999 losses. As noted, it was upland cotton producers ­ not ginners ­ who
were required to pay the $170.5 million difference in MY 1999 between the costs of ginning and the
value of the cottonseed. When cottonseed prices again plunged in MY 2001 and MY 2002, Congress
provided relief to producers with the 2002 cottonseed payments. For example, the $50 million in
cottonseed payments in MY 2002 covered part of a gap of $73 million between the ginning cost and the value of the cottonseed.201 Thus, this evidence suggests not only that cottonseed payments were
support to upland cotton within the meaning of Article 13(b)(ii) of the Agreement on Agriculture, but
that these payments, while relatively small in comparison to the billions of dollars paid to US
producers, nevertheless, provided yet further subsidies supporting large quantities of US upland
cotton production.

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-336
Brazil's Answer:
145. The Panel is well aware of Brazil's view that all of the US subsidies are non-green box. But if the Panel were to find that certain of the subsidies are green-box subsidies, then under the specific circumstances of this dispute, Article 13(a)(ii) of the Agreement on Agriculture prohibits ­ during the implementation period ­ the effects of these subsidies being included along with other effects of nongreen box subsidies in assessing Brazil's actionable subsidy claims. Professor Sumner's analysis in Annex I of Brazil's 9 September Further Submission permits the Panel to examine both the individual as well as collective effects of the various US subsidies. In response to Question 146, Professor Sumner analyzed the production, export and price effects of all of the subsidies except PFC subsidies.202 This analysis would also permit the Panel to ensure that effects caused by, for example, PFC payments, were not attributed to the effects caused by the other non-green box subsidies.
146. After the 9-year implementation period of the Agreement on Agriculture, there is nothing in that Agreement that exempts the effects of green box subsidies from being considered by panels in actions based on Articles 5 and 6 of the SCM Agreement. Subsidies that conform to Annex 2 of the Agreement on Agriculture are exempt from the reduction commitments established under Article 6, but there is nothing in Articles 5 or 6 of the SCM Agreement that provides for any type of exemption, beginning in 2004. On the contrary, Article 5 of the SCM Agreement clearly states the Members should not cause, "... through the use of any subsidy ... adverse effects to the interests of other Members." The only exception provided therein refers to the temporary exception of Article 13 of the Agreement on Agriculture.
246. Can a panel take prohibited subsidies into account in considering the effects of subsidies in an action based on Articles 5 and 6 of the SCM Agreement? BRA, USA
Brazil's Answer:
147. Yes, the Panel is required to take into account all non-green box subsidies, including prohibited subsidies in assessing Brazil's Article 5 and 6 claims under the SCM Agreement.203 Even if the Panel were to conclude that the effects of prohibited subsidies, such as Step 2 and export credit guarantees, should not be assessed for the purposes of Brazil's Article 5 and 6 claims, Professor Sumner's analysis permits the Panel to analyze such claims for those non-green box and nonprohibited subsidies (marketing loan payments, crop insurance subsidies and contract payments).
247. Can the Panel take into account trends and volatility in market and futures prices of upland cotton after the date of establishment of the Panel? If so, how do they affect the analysis of Brazil's claim of a threat of serious prejudice? BRA, USA
Brazil's Answer:
148. Yes. Nothing prevents the Panel from considering ­ in assessing Brazil's threat of serious prejudice claims ­ the volatility of the upland cotton market and current and likely futures price developments after the date of establishment of the Panel. Brazil has proposed that the Panel follow the guidance of the GATT EC ­ Sugar Exports panels and the Appellate Body in US ­ FSC and analyze whether there is any mechanism that stems, or otherwise controls, the flow of US upland

203 See Brazil's 27 October Answer to Question 145(b).

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-337
cotton subsidies and whether these mandated and unlimited subsidies constitute a permanent source of uncertainty in the upland cotton market.204
149. The Panel's question raises both legal and factual issues. First, as a legal matter, Brazil has previously argued that it is appropriate for the Panel to consider pricing, export, production, acreage and other evidence occurring after the date of establishment of the Panel.205 The Panel's terms of reference in this case involve both present and threat of serious prejudice claims (i.e., matters) with each of these types of claims overlapping during the period of MY 2002. Thus, the "matter" before the Panel has not changed (and cannot) since the establishment of the Panel.
150. In "making an objective assessment of the matter," the Panel must make "an objective assessment of the facts of the case" pursuant to DSU Article 11. Nothing in the text of DSU Article 11 suggests that this objective assessment of "facts" cannot include collecting and analyzing facts occurring after the establishment of a Panel. Indeed, there are a number of precedents in which panel's have considered evidence that came into existence after the date of the establishment of a panel.206 As with investigating authorities in trade remedy investigations, a "period of investigation" for a WTO Panel in an Article 5 and 6 claim is useful for assessing whether present or threatened effects presently exist. There is nothing in the text of Part III of the SCM Agreement or the DSU that suggests that the time period for the collection of evidence or data to investigate must stop with the establishment of the Panel.
151. The second question raised by the Panel's question is a factual one, i.e., what weight should the Panel give to the most recent evidence of volatility in the cotton futures and spot markets? It is fact that upland cotton prices have risen ­ and fallen ­ significantly since the Panel was established in March 2003. For example, futures prices for the nearby March 2004 contract rose from 55.80 cents on 6 March 2003 to a high of 86 cents on 30 October before falling to 72.32 cents on 19 December 2003.207 But the record shows that such volatile futures price increases ­ and decreases ­ also occurred between MY 1999-2002.208 And they will no doubt exist during MY 2003-2007.
152. In assessing whether there is a threat of serious prejudice, the Panel should be cautious about relying too heavily on only 3-4 months worth of the most recent data. Indeed, the Appellate Body has cautioned that "competent authorities are required to examine the trends in [data] over the entire period of investigation," because the "analysis could be easily manipulated to lead to different results, depending on the choice of end points."209 Similarly, in Argentina ­ Footwear the Appellate Body held that "competent authorities are required to consider the trends in imports over the period of investigation (rather than just comparing the end points)."210 The panel in Argentina ­ Peach Safeguards stated that "[t]the most recent past should not be considered separately from the overall
204 See Brazil's 18 November Further Rebuttal Submission, Section 4. 205 Brazil repeatedly in its many submission to the Panel refers to data that originates after the establishment of the Panel, including in these answers to the Panel's questions. 206 Panel Report, India ­ Quantitative Restrictions, WT/DS90/R, para. 5.161-5.163 ("In this case the parties and the IMF have supplied information concerning the evolution of India's balance of payments and reserve situation until June 1998. To the extent that such information is relevant to our determination of the consistency of India's balance of payments measures with GATT rules as of the date of establishment of the Panel [18 November 1997], we take it into account."); Panel Report, Japan ­ Apples, WT/DS245/R, para. 8.49; GATT Panel Report, Korea ­ Beef, BISD 36S/268, paras. 122-123. 207 Exhibit Bra-393 (Futures Prices as of 19 December 2003). 208 See Exhibit Bra-311 (Side-By-Side Chart of the Weekly US Adjusted World Price, the A-Index, the nearby New York Futures Price, the Average Spot Market Price and Prices Received by US Producers from January 1996 to the Present). 209 Appellate Body Report, US ­ Steel Safeguards, WT/DS248/AB/R, paras 353-356. 210 Appellate Body Report, Argentina ­ Footwear, WT/DS121/AB/R, para. 129.

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-338
trends during the period of analysis," as otherwise the resulting picture may be "quite misleading."211 The Panel in this case performs a task similar to a domestic competent authority in a trade remedy case.
153. The Panel has before it two different methodologies to judge the present price levels and threat of serious prejudice. The first methodology before the Panel is the use of baseline projections such as the USDA's and FAPRI's baseline projections to assess the effects of mandated US subsidies in the year ahead. Professor Sumner's analysis based on the January 2003 FAPRI baseline, shows that the US subsidies continue to maintain large amounts of US production whether prices are high or low. Professor Sumner found that during MY 2003-2007 annual US production would be 19.4 per cent lower leading to a reduction in projected US exports by 32.4 per cent annually and world prices that would be 8.3 per cent higher absent the US subsidies.212 Similarly, Professor Ray of the University of Tennessee also found significant production, export, and price suppressing effects from the US subsidies from MY 2003-2007.213 These findings by two of the leading US economists cannot be ignored by the Panel.
154. A second far less valid methodology would be to use the US "futures methodology." This methodology would examine the December futures price at the time of planting (JanuaryMarch 2004). What is significant about current futures prices (in December 2003) is that the "futures market" is predicting that prices will fall in MY 2004. The December 2003 price of the December 2004 futures contract is 65.85 cents per pound as of 19 December 2003, while the March 2004 futures contract is 72.32 cents per pound.214 Assuming that the current 65.85 cents per pound December 2004 futures contract price will continue during the planting decision marking time between January-March 2004, the expected adjusted world price will be 52.48 cents per pound215 and the expected average MY 2004 price received by US producers would be 59.73 cents per pound.216 This means that US producers "expect" to receive a considerable CCP payment of 6 cents per pound in MY 2004 (65.73 cents minus 59.73 cents).
155. As discussed by Professor Sumner on 3 December, given the probability distribution of the expected adjusted world price,217 producers would also expect to receive some marketing loan payments because producers expect with a certain probability that the adjusted world price would be below the marketing loan rate triggering marketing loan payments.
156. As with the period MY 1999-2002, the existing (December 2003) price levels in the upland cotton world and US markets mean that US producers will be planting in 2004 for government support during MY 2004, not for the market. This constant theme was recently emphasized by the world's largest cotton trader, William Dunavant:
The [US] farm programme can return more when prices are low rather than when prices are high . . . [and] [t]he loan deficiency payment created by the farm programme is the name of the game ­ not necessarily the futures price or the cash price . . .

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-339
It's interesting that we project nearly an 8 per cent increase in world production [in MY 2003], but US production is forecast to rise only slightly. This tells me the world is certainly more price sensitive and responsive than the US cotton producer. I think the nature of our farm programme definitely creates this situation. Cotton futures prices need to rise to nearly 70 cents a pound to make cash prices better than the farm programme protection.218
In addition, Mr. Dunavant emphasized that US producers "must have" the GSM-102 programme "if we are to export the quantities needed to support our level of cotton production in this country [i.e., the United States]."219 These statements by the world's leading cotton trader confirm the significant effects that have existed and will continue to exist at current price levels because of the mandatory nature of the subsidy programmes.
157. Finally, nothing about the price levels that have increased since 18 March 2003 has changed in any way the mandatory nature of the US subsidies. At current price levels, producers would receive benefits from crop insurance subsidies, direct payments, and indirectly from Step 2 payments and export credit guarantees. Whether prices are at 70 cents per pound or 30 cents per pound, US producers know and expect that they will be protected by the wide range of US subsidies. When US prices decline, as they inevitable will, US producers will be provided direct production incentives to continue producing at any price level. Historical data convincingly demonstrates that this downside risk protection guarantees high levels of production. Brazil proved that US planted acreage remains high within relatively narrow ranges whether market prices increase or decrease. This lack of US producers' production response to huge costs overruns of $12.5 billion over six years or to record low prices, or even to increasing prices, is at the heart of Brazil's threat case. While the cumulative pricesuppressing and export-enhancing effects of the US subsidies may be smaller now than they were on 18 March 2003, they are, and will remain significant for MY 2003 and for MY 2004 based on current prices.
158. In sum, Brazil reiterates its arguments that taking all available data into account, the US subsidies pose a threat of serious prejudice to the interests of Brazil, in violation of Articles 5(c) and 6.3 of the SCM Agreement and GATT Articles XVI:1 and XVI:3.220
VI. Step 2
248. In respect of the level of Step 2 payments in certain time periods, the Panel notes, inter alia, footnote 129 in the US first written submission; footnote 33 in the US 18 November further rebuttal submission; and Exhibit BRA-350. Have Step 2 payments ever been zero since the elimination of the 1.25 cent per pound threshold in the FSRI Act of 2002? In what circumstances could a Step 2 payment be zero? How does the elimination of the 1.25 cent per pound threshold in the FSRI Act of 2002 affect your response? BRA, USA
Brazil's Answer:
159. Under the 2002 FSRI Act (with the elimination of the 1.25 cent per pound threshold), Step 2 payments will be zero when the lowest US A-Index quote is equal or below the average A-Index.221 Thus, for Step 2 payments to expire, the lowest US quote will have to be one of the cheapest of the

220 See Section 4 of Brazil's 18 November Further Rebuttal Submission. 221 Exhibit Bra-29 (Section 1207 (a) of the FSRI Act).

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-340
only five quotes making up the given A-Index. During MY 2002, there were zero Step 2 payments during five weeks: 20 September, 27 September, 4 October, 11 October and 18 October 2002.222
160. By contrast, during MY 2001, Step 2 payments were zero during 15 weeks: 14 December, 21 December, 28 December, 4 January, 11 January, 18 January, 25 January, 1 February, 8 February, 15 February, 22 February, 1 March, 8 March, 15 March, and 22 March.223
161. The elimination of the 1.25 cent per pound threshold under the 2002 FSRI Act has reduced the likelihood of zero payments under the Step 2 programme because the lowest US quote must now be even lower relative to the A-Index for Step 2 payments to expire. It also means that the US government will pay the entire difference between the cheapest US price quote for the A-Index and the A-Index itself.
249. The Panel notes that the definition of eligible "exporter" in 7 CFR 1427.104(a)(2) includes "a producer":
(a) How does this reconcile with Brazil's argument that Step 2 "export payments" do not directly benefit the producer?224 How, if at all, would this be relevant for an analysis of the issue of export contingency under the Agreement on Agriculture or the SCM Agreement? BRA
Brazil's Answer:
162. As set out in Brazil's Answer to Question 125, Step 2 payments generally are not received by US producers but rather by eligible exporters and domestic users.225 Of course, it is theoretically possible for a producer to receive directly Step 2 payments when the producer meets the definition of an exporter "regularly engaged in selling eligible upland cotton for exportation from the United States."226 However, the fact that most US producers do not directly receive Step 2 payments does not mean that they do not benefit indirectly from Step 2 payments. Quite the contrary. Step 2 payments support significant quantities of planted upland cotton acreage, production and exports by stimulating the demand for high-cost and high-priced US cotton.227 Brazil has provided considerable evidence of these effects in its earlier submissions that has never been rebutted by the United States.228
163. The answer to the second question is "not at all." Exporters are only eligible to receive Step 2 export payments if they produce evidence to CCC that they have exported an amount of US upland cotton. Thus, payments are conditional upon proof of export. Exporters will not receive any Step 2 export payments if they have not produced evidence of the export of US upland cotton. In sum, the fact that producers ­ in their capacity as exporters ­ may benefit from Step 2 export payments does not impact the export contingency of these payments.

VII. Remedies
250. Does Brazil seek relief under Article XVI of GATT 1994 in respect of expired measures? What type of recommendation would the Panel be authorized to make? (Brazil further submission, paragraph 471 (iii)) BRA
Brazil's Answer:
164. Brazil does not seek relief under GATT Article XVI of GATT 1994 in respect of expired measures, which Brazil understands the Panel to mean only the legal instruments consisting of the 1996 US Farm Bill providing, inter alia, for production flexibility contract payments, as well as the various emergency appropriation Acts in 1998-2001 providing, inter alia, for market loss assistance payments.229
165. With respect to the second question, the Appellate Body held in US ­ Certain EC Products, that a panel may not make a recommendation to the DSB that a Member bring a measure into conformity with its WTO obligations if that measure no longer exists.230 Therefore, as detailed in paragraph 471(x) of Brazil's 9 September Further Submission, Brazil requests the Panel to recommend that the United States bring its existing measures providing or facilitating the payment of subsidies to producers, users and exporters of upland cotton into conformity with GATT Article XVI.
251. In light, inter alia, of Article 7.8 of the SCM Agreement, if the Panel were to find that any subsidies have resulted in adverse effects to the interests of another Member within the meaning of Article 5 of the SCM Agreement, should it make any recommendation other than the one set out in the first sentence of Article 19.1 of the DSU? BRA
Brazil's Answer:
166. Yes. If the Panel agrees with Brazil that the US subsidies to upland cotton cause and threaten to cause serious prejudice to the interests of Brazil, in violation of Article 5 of the SCM Agreement, the Panel should recommend pursuant to Article 7.8 of the SCM Agreement that the United States remove these adverse effects or withdraw the subsidies.231
252. Without prejudice to any findings by the Panel, if the Panel were to find that any of the challenged measures constitute prohibited subsidies within the meaning of Article 3 of the SCM Agreement, what are the considerations that should guide the Panel in making a recommendation under Article 4.7 of the SCM Agreement relating to the time period "within which the measure must be withdrawn"? What should that time period be? BRA
229 Brazil's claims under Articles 5(a) and 6(c) of the SCM Agreement do include the continuing adverse effects today and in the future of subsidies provided under these expired legal provisions. See Brazil's 24 July Closing Statement, paras 4-7.

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-342
Brazil's Answer:
167. Brazil suggests that the Panel follow the precedent of all previous WTO panels232 that made findings of prohibited subsidies and specify that the measure must be withdrawn within 90 days.233
VIII. Miscellaneous
253. Regarding the adjustment authority related to Uruguay Round compliance in s.1601(e) of the FSRI Act of 2002 (the so-called "circuit-breaker provision"):
(a) Does it relate to export credit guarantees, crop insurance and cottonseed payments?
(b) Does it relate only to compliance with AMS commitments?
(c) Is the authority discretionary? If so, can its exercise be limited by the legislative branch of government?
(d) How would the Secretary exercise her authority to prevent serious prejudice to the interests of another Member? How would she exercise her authority to prevent a threat of serious prejudice to the interests of another Member? At what time and on the basis of what type of information would she exercise her authority?
(e) What does "to the maximum extent practicable" mean? In what circumstances would it not be practicable for the Secretary to exercise her adjustment authority? USA
254. Would payments made after the date of panel establishment be mandatory under the marketing loan, direct payments, counter-cyclical payments and user marketing certificate (step 2) programmes, but for the circuit-breaker provision? USA
255. How does Brazil respond to US assertions concerning the circuit-breaker provision? (see US 2 December oral statement, paragraph 82). Does this mean that US subsidies cannot be "mandatory" for the purposes of WTO dispute settlement? BRA
Brazil's Answer:
168. The United States has admitted what the text of the "circuit breaker" provision in Section 1601(e)(1) of the 2002 FSRI Act already makes clear, i.e. that it only applies to "total allowable domestic support levels under the Uruguay Round Agreements," i.e., "total AMS."234 The United States further acknowledges that this provision "is not specifically addressed to forestalling
232 Panel Report, Brazil ­ Aircraft, WT/DS46/R, para. 8.5; Panel Report, Canada ­ Aircraft, WT/DS70/R, para. 10.4; Panel Report, Australia ­ Leather, WT/DS126/R, paras. 10.6-10.7, Panel Report, WT/DS139/R and WT/DS142/R, paras. 11.6-11.7 and Panel Report, Canada ­ Aircraft II, WT/DS222/R, para. 8.4.
233 Brazil notes that the panel in US ­ FSC took account of the fact that the US tax system could only be changed from the beginning of the next fiscal year and therefore set the 1 October 2001 as the deadline for withdrawing the FSC subsidies "without delay."
234 US 2 December Oral Statement, para. 82

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-343
serious prejudice."235 Indeed, no provision in US law is designed to forestall serious prejudice to US trading partners caused by US agricultural subsidies specifically in support of upland cotton. 169. The current US "total AMS" is $19.1 billion. As long as the United States stays below this level, there is no legal provision in the 2002 FSRI Act granting the Secretary of Agriculture any authority to stem, or otherwise control, the amount of upland cotton subsidies. Indeed, the numerous mandatory provisions of the 2002 FSRI Act text cited in Brazil's earlier submissions236 requires the Secretary to make the payments to which eligible producers, users and exporters have a legal entitlement. No exceptions for upland cotton are provided for. Thus, these provisions continue to be mandatory in all circumstances where the US total AMS is below $19.1 billion. The Appellate Body and WTO panels have held that measures are mandatory where they cannot be applied in a WTO consistent manner in certain circumstances.237 170. And even were the US total AMS to exceed $19.1 billion, the text of Section 1601(e)(1) does not mandate any reductions if it is not "practicable" to do so. Nor does the text mandate an even, across the board, cut for all programme crops. For example, the Secretary appears to have the discretion to cut corn or wheat subsidies but retain the full amount of upland cotton subsidies. Brazil will provide further comments on the "circuit breaker" provision on 19 January in response to the US Answers to Questions 253-254. 256. The United States submits that the Panel cannot make rulings without allocating precise amounts of payments to upland cotton production. However, to the extent that such precise data is not on the Panel record, to what extent can the Panel rely on less precise data, and on reasonable assumptions, in fulfilling its duty under Article 11 of the DSU in this case?

ANNEX I-8
ANSWERS OF THE UNITED STATES TO QUESTIONS POSED BY THE PANEL FOLLOWING THE SECOND SUBSTANTIVE MEETING OF THE PANEL
(22 December 2003)
A. TERMS OF REFERENCE
192. Regarding the interest subsidies and storage payments listed by the United States in its response to the Panel's Question No. 67:
(a) Please provide a copy of the regulations under which they are currently and under which they were provided during the marketing years 1996-2002;
1. For interest subsidies and storage payments under the 1996 Act (marketing years 1996-2002), the relevant regulations are found at 7 CFR 1427.13 and 1427.19 (2000 ed.) (first published at 61 FR 37601, 18 July 1996).1 Under the 2002 Act, those rules are found at 7 CFR 1427.13 and 1427.19 (2003 ed.) (first published at 67 FR 64459, 18 October 2002).2 We describe and discuss these provisions below in response to part "(b)" of this question.
(b) Please indicate whether there are any such payments which are not provided to implement the repayment rate for upland cotton within the marketing loan programme. USA
2. Interest subsidies and storage payments are support provided in connection with the marketing loan programme. On a forfeit of warehouse-stored upland cotton under loan, the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) pays warehouse charges for the loan period (even though the farmer had title during that period) and forgives interest. 7 CFR 1427.13 (2000 ed. and 2003 ed.). As for redemption of cotton under loan, repayment rates depend on the world market price. If the repayment amount set on that price is low enough, CCC may have to forgive interest and pay storage charges because the repayment amount will not be enough to satisfy the loan amount and those charges. See 1427.19(e) (2000 and 2002). By contrast, if the repayment rate set on the world market price is high enough, the producer pays both. Id. In general, if the loan is repaid, there is not an interest subsidy at all; rather, in 7 CFR Part 1405, it is provided that CCC will charge the sum of (1) the rate that CCC pays the Treasury and (2) another 1 per cent per annum. We are not aware of any other payments that would be responsive to the panel's question.
1 See Exhibit US-117 (7 CFR 1427.13 and 1427.19 (2000 ed.)). 2 See Exhibit US-118 (7 CFR 1427.13 and 1427.19 (2003 ed.)).

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-345
194. Does the United States maintain its position stated in response to the Panel's Question No. 67 that "it would not be appropriate for the Panel to examine payments made after the date of panel establishment"? If so, please explain why. Can Brazil comment on this statement? BRA, USA
3. In response to the Panel's Question 67, which asked the parties "to calculate and submit estimates of the AMS for upland cotton for marketing years 1992, 1999, 2000, 2001 and 2002," the United States stated, in the context of its calculation of the AMS for marketing year 2002, that "it would not be appropriate for the Panel to examine payments made after the date of panel establishment, on which the Panel's terms of reference were set. Measures taken after the Panel was established cannot be within the Panel's terms of reference."3 The United States continues to believe that this statement is accurate. Past panels have frequently been confronted with the issue of the date as of which measures should be examined. Panels have generally determined to examine those measures as of the date of panel establishment as a matter both of terms of reference as well as for practical reasons (for example, so as to allow findings to be made with respect to a measure withdrawn after the panel was established but before panel proceedings were completed).
4. The Panel's terms of reference were set by the DSB at its meeting on 18 March 2003, namely, "[t]o examine, in the light of the relevant provisions of the covered agreements cited by Brazil in document WT/DS267/7, the matter referred to the DSB by Brazil in that document and to make such findings as will assist the DSB in making the recommendations or in giving the rulings provided for in those agreements."4 In that panel request, Brazil identifies the measures at issue as "prohibited and actionable subsidies provided to US producers, users and/or exporters of upland cotton."5 In Brazil's answer to question 19 from the Panel, Brazil clarified: "Brazil's Request for Establishment of a Panel (`Panel Request') challenges two types of domestic support `measures' provided to upland cotton and various different types of export subsidy measures. The first type of domestic support "measure" is the payment of subsidies for the production and use of upland cotton. These payments were and continue to be made between MY 1999 to the present (and will be made through MY 2007) through the various statutory and regulatory instruments listed on pages 2-3 of Brazil's Panel Request. Brazil referred to these payments at pages 2-3 of the Panel Request as `subsidies and domestic support provided under' or `mandated to be provided' under the various listed statutory and regulatory instruments. Brazil has tabulated the different types of payments (i.e., the measures) made under these legal instruments in paragraphs 146-149 of its First Submission."6 That is, to the extent that "payments" are at issue (as opposed to Brazil's challenge of certain legal instruments "as such")7, the "measure" is "the payment of subsidies for the production and use of upland cotton." Only those payments made through the date of panel establishment could be "measures at issue" within the meaning of DSU Article 6.2 (as opposed to measures not yet taken, such as the Agricultural Assistance Act of 2003, which had not been enacted at the time of Brazil's panel request).
5. Thus, for purposes of the Panel's Peace Clause analysis or the evaluation of the "effect of the subsidy" for purposes of the Panel's actionable subsidies analysis, Brazil's choice to obtain establishment of this Panel several months into the 2002 marketing year but well before that marketing year was completed necessarily impacts the payments ("measure") that the Panel may examine. The payment of subsidies after panel establishment cannot alter the measures within the Panel's terms of reference and properly before the Panel, just as the cessation of payments after panel establishment would not prevent the Panel from making findings as to those payments that had been made as of the date of establishment.

B. ECONOMIC DATA
195. Does the United States wish to revise its response to the Panel's Question No. 67bis, in particular, its statement that "the United States ... does not maintain information on the amount of expenditures made under the cited programmes to US upland cotton producers"? Did the United States make enquiries of the FSA in the course of preparing its original answer?
6. Question No. 67bis inquired about annual amounts granted to upland cotton producers per pound and in total expenditures under each of the decoupled payment programmes. The United States of course conferred with US Department of Agriculture personnel, including FSA personnel, concerning this question and reported to the Panel that USDA "does not maintain information on the amount of expenditures made under the cited programmes to US upland cotton producers."8 That response remains accurate today: because those payments are decoupled from current production, expenditures under such programmes are not tracked by whether the recipient produces upland cotton. In fact, the United States does not collect production data based on actual harvesting figures reported by farmers; we do not understand Brazil to have asserted the contrary.9
7. Brazil has also not asserted that the United States maintains information on the receipt of decoupled payments for upland cotton base acres by upland cotton producers. Rather, it has presented a novel methodology developed by the Environmental Working Group (EWG) to compare disparate data separately collected by the United States to attempt to infer that information. 10EWG compared the farm numbers of recipients of decoupled payments for upland cotton base acres with the farm numbers of recipients of marketing loan payments in marketing years 2000-2002. It bears emphasis that the latter database is not a production database based on actual harvesting figures reported by farmers; the marketing loan database merely records the quantities of cotton on which a recipient has received payments. By comparing the matches by farm number between the two databases, EWG calculated that the share of decoupled payments for upland cotton base acres paid to upland cotton "producers" (that is, recipients of marketing loan payments) was 71.3 per cent in marketing year 2000, 76.9 per cent in marketing year 2001, and 73.6 per cent in marketing year 2002.
8. As we have previously mentioned11, using the marketing loan payments database to identify "producers" would be contingent on marketing year prices; only if prices are sufficiently low would a high proportion of production of a crop receive marketing loan payments. This appears to have been the case for upland cotton in some recent marketing years but will not always be so (for example, no marketing loan payments are being made in the 2003 marketing year) and was not the case for other commodities (in marketing year 2002, total marketing loan payments of only $16.3 million for soybeans, $16.3 million for corn, and $16.1 million for wheat were made).12
8 US Comments and Answer to Additional Question, para. 20. 9 We do note that the record reflects the extensive evidence the United States has presented on the programmes and crop in question, from the actual data of amounts paid under the programmes to the amounts of cotton that have been planted from year to year. Further, in response to a Brazilian request for certain information that was presented for the first time at the second panel meeting, the United States generated, through significant expenditures of time and resources, aggregate and farm-by-farm records for both the "PFC" and "DCP" period for every "cotton farm" in the United States, including the planting records for all such farms. These data were transmitted on 18 and 19 December 2003. 10 See Brazil's Further Rebuttal Submission, para. 31 ("If USDA was able to provide comprehensive payment data for all (or most) payments in an electronic format, it is also able to generate information on subsidy payments made to farms.") (emphasis added). 11 US Opening Oral Statement at Second Panel Meeting, para. 29. 12 Exhibit US-93. For this reason, it is fallacious for Brazil to argue that the specialization of cotton farms on cotton is show by the alleged fact that "[i]n MY 2002, 92.45 per cent of marketing loan payments for all crops made to farms producing upland cotton were made with respect to upland cotton." Brazil's Further

9. We note that Brazil has not made any adjustment in the outlay figures it has presented to the Panel for purposes of both Peace Clause and its actionable subsidy claims to reflect the fact that the EWG percentages are substantially lower than the 87 per cent revision made by Brazil to correct its initial Peace Clause analysis. The adjustment resulting from the EWG data in the total decoupled payments for upland cotton base acres made to upland cotton "producers" is also substantial. Since Brazil presents the EWG percentages as Brazil's own data, Brazil has effectively conceded that its own figures should be corrected at least as follows:

The Panel can see a rather striking decline in the decoupled payments at issue that have not been reflected in Brazil's argumentation to the Panel.
10. We note further, however, that the EWG figures do not end the story. These figures represent only the first step in a proper calculation of the decoupled payments received by upland cotton producers that benefit upland cotton. For example, as detailed in the US answer to question 242 from the Panel, the literature on decoupled payments indicates that these payments benefit the owners of the base acres on which payments are made; payments made on rented acres will be captured by landowners through increased rent or other arrangements. Brazil itself has conceded that as of marketing year 1997 ­ that is, only the first year after introduction of the production flexibility contracts ­ already 34-41 cents per dollar of production flexibility contract payment were capitalized into land rents.16 Thus, based on its own evidence, Brazil should have adjusted the EWG figures downwards by 22 to 27 per cent to reflect the capture by landowners (who are not producers) through increased rent of 34-41 per cent of decoupled payments on the 65 per cent of cotton acres that are rented.17 Furthermore, this study as of marketing year 1997 is consistent with the evidence presented by the United States that as rental contracts come up for renewal the full value of the decoupled

Rebuttal Submission, para. 26. If prices were above the respective loan rates for other crops produced by a farm
also producing upland cotton, then logically the share of marketing loan payments for upland cotton will be
high, given that upland cotton prices were so low in marketing year 2002. The fallacy of Brazil's argument is
further demonstrated by reviewing the data submitted by the United States on 19 December 2003. In the
aggregated data file "Dcpsum.xls", for marketing year 2002 upland cotton planted area represented only 30.7
per cent of total cropland for "cotton farms" (13.541 million acres out of total cropland of 44.036 million acres). 13 Brazil's First Written Submission, paras. 148-49. 14 Brazil's Answer to Question 67 from the Panel, para. 130 (adjusted amount of decoupled payments
for upland cotton base acres estimated as "support for upland cotton"). 15 Brazil's Further Rebuttal Submission, para. 23 (EWG data on amount of decoupled payments for
upland cotton base acres received by upland cotton "producers") 16 Brazil's Answer to Question 179 from the Panel, para. 165; Brazil's Opening Oral Statement at the
Second Panel Meeting, para. 57. 17 See Exhibit US-69 (cost of production data published by the Economic Research Service, based on
the 1997 ARMS survey, showing cotton producers owning 35 per cent of land they operate).

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-348
payments on rented acres will be captured by landowners and capitalized into land values.18 Thus, to reflect the benefit to upland cotton producers, the EWG data should be adjusted downwards by 65 per cent to reflect the fact that "[n]ot all operators [producers] can therefore be considered as true beneficiaries of the [PFC] programme, since competitive cropland rental markets work to pass through payments from PFC recipients who are tenants to the owners of base acres."19 Only those upland cotton producers who are owners of upland cotton base acres will receive the benefit of those decoupled payments.
11. Finally, to answer the Panel's question on the total payments for upland cotton base acres that benefit upland cotton producers would require information relating to the total value of each recipient's production. The EWG figures, adjusted to account for the capture of 65 per cent of those payments by owners of base acreage who are not cotton producers, would need to be allocated across the total value of production in order to calculate the subsidy benefit to upland cotton. Brazil has not brought forward information to permit that allocation; in fact, as discussed in more detail in the US answer to question 256 from the Panel, Brazil has not even claimed that such an allocation is necessary. Accordingly, it does not appear possible to calculate the total payments to upland cotton producers that benefit upland cotton nor any per pound measurement.
196. Please provide the latest data for the 2002 marketing year on payments under the marketing loan, direct payments, counter-cyclical payments, user marketing certificate (step 2) programmes and export credit guarantee programmes. BRA, USA
12. Data for marketing loan and user marketing certificate programmes are for upland cotton only and are current as of 12 December 2003.20
· Marketing loan programme (includes loan deficiency payments, marketing loan gains, and certificate gains): $832,836,963
· Step 2 payments (data are on a October 2002 - September 2003 fiscal year basis): $415,379,000
13. Data for direct payments and counter-cyclical payments are presented for upland cotton base acres only and are current as of 12 December 2003.21
· Direct payments: $181,811,374 million. (Because the 2002 marketing year was a transition year between the 1996 and 2002 farm bills, $436,805,000 in Production Flexibility Contract payments were made in 2002.)

15. The 11 December 2003 World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates report, published
by USDA's Office of the Chief Economist, the Department's official commodity estimates, provide
the latest data available. Note that 2002/03 is still considered an estimate and 2003/04 is considered a projection.23

The updated data show that the US world market share is basically unchanged from Exhibit US-47; in fact, US world market share using the 11 December 2003 data is the same (19.6 per cent) as reported in the exhibit.25 Viewed in conjunction with the data in Exhibit US-47, the data further confirm that there has been no increase in US world market share following a consistent trend over a period when subsidies to upland cotton have been granted.
198. Please comment on the respective merits of the price-gap calculations of MY1992 deficiency payments in US comments of 27 August, footnote 14 ($867 million), and Brazil's response to the Panel's Question No. 67 ($812 million).
16. The two calculations use similar methodologies to measure MY 1992 deficiency payments. Both measures calculate deficiency payments as the deficiency payment rate times eligible production. Both the US and Brazil measures use the same deficiency payment rate for MY 1992 of 15 cents per pound. The difference between the two measures can thus be attributed to how each calculated the amount of production eligible for deficiency payments.
17. In their response to the Panel's Question No. 67, Brazil provides a simplistic calculation of payment production by multiplying the upland cotton programme yield times the amount of area eligible for deficiency payments. But as the United States previously indicated26, the average programme yield for deficiency payment recipients in MY 1992 was 601 pounds per acre and the average programme yield for 50/92 recipients was 628 pounds per acre. By contrast, Brazil

found in this report are current as of 9/30/03 and differ slightly from these figures, which reflect exporter

activity through mid-December, including cancellations and reserve activity. 23 USDA Office of the Chief Economist, World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates,

11 December 2003 (Exhibit US-119). 24 The US consumption figure includes imports. However, US cotton imports are often zero and, even

when positive, have accounted for less than one per cent of consumption over the past decade. See USDA,

Economic Research Service, Fibers Yearbook, Appendix Table 2, Upland Cotton Supply and Use (Exhibit US-

120).

25 See also US Opening Oral Statement at the Second Panel Meeting, para. 13. 26 US Comments and Answer to Additional Question, para. 8 fn. 14.

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-350
incorrectly estimates programme yields to be 531 pounds per acre. This underestimates deficiency payments for MY 1992.
18. The US calculation uses the methodology set out in paragraphs 10 and 11 of Annex 3. Consistent with the 1995 US WTO notification, payment production is the sum of production eligible for basic deficiency payments and production eligible for 50/92 payments. Eligible production for basic deficiency payments in 1992 was equal to 5,544 million pounds (9.226 million acres times the average programme yield of 601 pounds per acre). Multiplying the price gap times eligible production gives basic deficiency payments equal to $832 million. The same formula is used to calculate deficiency payments under the 50/92 programme. For 1992, the price gap is the same as that calculated for the basic deficiency payments (15 cents per pound). Eligible production under the 50/92 programme was 254 million pounds (404 thousand acres times the average programme yield of 50/92 participants of 628 pounds per acre). Deficiency payments under the 50/92 programme were thus equal to $35 million (0.92 times 254 million times $0.15). Total deficiency payments under the price gap methodology were thus equal to $867 million ($832 million plus $35 million).
19. We also note that this calculation is conservative in that it uses the actual payment acreage (that is, acres planted for harvest or participating in the 50/92 programme on which payment was received) rather than eligible acreage to calculate the "quantity of production eligible to receive the applied administered price."27 Using instead the base acreage minus the 10 per cent acreage reduction figure and the 15 per cent normal flex acres (14.9 million effective base acres28 x 0.75 = 11.175 million acres) and multiplying by the programme yield (602 pounds per acre), the "quantity of production eligible to receive the administered price" is 6,727 million pounds, yielding a price gap deficiency payment calculation of $1,009 million.
201. Is data available to show the proportion of US upland cotton production sold under futures contracts, and the prices under those contracts, at different times during the marketing year? If so, please provide summarized versions to the Panel. How does a futures sale impact the producer's entitlement to marketing loan programme payments? BRA, USA
20. In April 1999, the US General Accounting Office published a report on farmers' use of risk management strategies.29 Based on survey data from the 1996 USDA Agricultural Resource Management Study, the study showed that between 35 and 57 per cent of cotton farmers used a hedging instrument in 1996. (The ranges reflect a 95 per cent confidence interval.) In addition, an estimated 63 to 89 per cent of cotton farms used cash forward contracts in 1996.30 These survey results suggest that even seven years ago a large proportion of cotton farmers either directly or indirectly priced their cotton off of organized futures and options markets.
21. For 18 December 2003, total open interest for all cotton futures contracts on the New York Board of Trade was 79,283 contracts31 while open interest for all cotton options contracts on the
27 Agreement on Agriculture, Annex 3, para. 10. 28 See Exhibit Bra-105, Annex 2 (1st source document: US Department of Agriculture, Provisions of the Federal Agricultural Improvement and Reform Act of 1996, at 142) (giving 1992 effective base acreage of 14.9 million acres); id., Annex 2 (2nd source document: Daniel A. Sumner, Farm Programmes and Related Policy in the United States, at 4) (same). 29 US General Accounting Office. Agriculture in Transition: Farmers' Use of Risk Management Strategies. GAO/RCED-99-90. April 1999. See page 9, table 4 (Exhibit US-121) 30 A forward contract is defined as a cash market transaction in which two parties agree to buy or sell a commodity or asset under agreed-upon conditions. For example, a farmer agrees sell, and a ginner or warehouse agrees to buy, cotton at a specific future time for an agreed-upon price or on the basis of an agreed on pricing mechanism (such as a futures or options market). See Exhibit US-121, page 22. 31 See, Exhibit US-122.

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-351

NYBOT totalled 320,657 contracts.32 Based on a contract size of 50,000 pounds, total open interest on futures and options contracts represent 41.7 million bales. While a bale of cotton may be hedged several times throughout the marketing chain, we note that 41 million bales is approximately 2.3 times the total size of the US upland cotton crop. A futures or options contract transaction has no effect on a producer's entitlement to marketing loan programme payments.

202. Concerning paragraph 7 of the US oral statement, are the expected cash prices shown for February only? Can the US provide the prices for January and March of each year as well? USA

22. The following tables show the average daily closing futures price for the December contract
for January, February and March, as well as the average for the three months. As the United States previously noted33, the differences between months is small. As outlined in paragraph 162 of the US

205. Does the United States accept or agree with the EWG data submitted by Brazil? If not, please explain your reasons. USA
23. USDA provided the EWG with payment data under a Freedom of Information Act Request. Although the United States can confirm the data transmitted to EWG was correct, we do not know if the data has changed after EWG further processed the information. Taking that data at face value, the United States would note the following.
32 See, Exhibit US-123. 33 US Further Rebuttal Submission, para. 162 fn. 124 ("The United States notes that the January-March average futures price for December delivery does not differ significantly from the February average presented in the text.").

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-352
24. As was reported in the US Answer to Panel Question 125(5) and the US oral statement of 2 December, a preliminary review of data from the Farm Service Agency shows that approximately 47 per cent of upland cotton farms eligible for decoupled income support payments planted no cotton in marketing year 2002. This number is consistent with the Environmental Working Group data presented by Brazil in its further rebuttal submission that showed the per cent of farms receiving only contract payments in 2000, 2001, and 2002 (46, 45, and 45 per cent, respectively).34 Thus, the EWG data support the US position that decoupled income support is, in fact, decoupled from production decisions since nearly half of historic upland cotton farms no longer plant even a single acre of cotton.35
25. The EWG data also show that Brazil's 14/16 adjustment to decoupled payments, even on Brazil's faulty allocation theory, is too small an adjustment. Brazil has asserted that 87 per cent of decoupled payments for upland cotton base acres are received by upland cotton producers and support to upland cotton. However, the EWG data suggest that in marketing years 2000, 2001, and 2002 only 71, 77, and 74 per cent, respectively of upland cotton base acreage payments went to farms that planted upland cotton. Thus, the EWG data support the US position that Brazil has overestimated and failed to properly calculate the subsidy benefit to upland cotton provided by these payments. For further detail, please see the US answer to question 195.
26. We also note a serious misuse of the EWG data when Brazil claims that, because approximately 92 per cent of total marketing loan payments received in MY 2002 by farms planting upland cotton were upland cotton payments, therefore such farms must predominantly produce cotton. In fact, marketing loan payments crucially depend on whether prices are above or below the loan rate for the crop at issue. Soybeans and corn saw high prices in MY 2002, meaning few marketing loan payments were made in MY2002.36 Furthermore, the data collected by the United States in response to Brazil's request for certain information demonstrate that for MY 2002 upland cotton planted acres accounted for only 29.4 per cent of total cropland of those farms receiving production flexibility contract payments for upland cotton base acreage. Thus, the EWG data on marketing loan payments does not support an inference that farms producing upland cotton are so "specialized in upland cotton"37 that it would be "reasonable" to attribute decoupled payments for upland cotton base acres almost entirely (87 per cent) to upland cotton.
206. Please explain how the graph in paragraph 40 of the US further rebuttal submission was derived. In so doing, please clarify whether the figures are on a cents per pound basis or some other basis. What averaging method was used? Can you prepare individual charts showing average US and Brazilian cotton prices for each of those third country markets? USA
27. The data were based on official export data reported by the United States and Brazil, as obtained and published in the "World Trade Atlas". The World Trade Atlas is a service that monthly provides world-wide trade information for a fee.
28. The United States reports its export values to the World Trade Atlas as F.A.S. and Brazil reports its values as F.O.B.
34 Brazil's Further Rebuttal Submission, para 23. 35 Indeed, even Brazil states that "the evidence still suggests that there are a large number of very small farms (with base acreage resulting from production dating back as far as MY 1981-85) that no longer produce upland cotton," Brazil's Further Rebuttal Submission, para. 27 (emphasis added), which would seem to support the US view that contract payments are decoupled from production decisions. 36 See US Opening Oral Statement at the Second Panel Meeting, para. 29. 37 See Brazil's Further Rebuttal Submission, para. 26.

Free Along Ship Export Value (F.A.S.) ­ The value of exports at the seaport, airport, or border, port of export, based on the transaction price, including inland freight, insurance, and other charges incurred in placing the merchandise alongside the carrier at the port of exportation. The value, as defined, excludes the cost of loading the merchandise aboard the exporting carrier and also excludes freight, insurance, and any charges or transportation costs beyond the port of exportation.
Free On Board (F.O.B.) ­ A standard reference to the price of merchandise on the border or at a national port. In F.O.B. contracts, the seller is obliged to have the goods packaged and ready for shipment at the place agreed upon, and purchaser agrees to cover all ground transport costs and to assure all risks in the exporting country, together with subsequent transport costs and expenses incurred in loading the goods onto the chosen means of transport.
FOB is greater than FAS except when the vessel is not changed at the port of export, in which case the values are equal.
29. The World Trade Atlas publishes an average unit price for exports. The average unit price is calculated by dividing the value of the exports by the quantity for selected HS codes. Average unit prices are expressed in dollars per kilogram. This value was converted to dollars per pound for the graphs.

207. Please indicate whether any of the measures challenged in this dispute obliges cotton farmers to harvest their crop in order to receive the benefit of the programme (subsidy).

31. One programme at issue in this dispute requires that a cotton farmer harvest upland cotton in order to receive payment: the marketing loan programme. In addition, the user marketing certificate programme (Step 2) requires that upland cotton have been harvested and marketed although payment is made to upland cotton users and not to farmers directly.

208. Please provide data for the marketing years 1992 and 1999-2002 of the "quantity of production to receive the applied administered price" (Agreement on Agriculture, Annex 3, paragraph 8) for purposes of a price-gap calculation of support through the marketing loan programme.

32. The marketing loan programme is a direct payment to support producer income that is "dependent on a price gap," namely, the difference between the loan rate and the Adjusted World Price. Thus, the price-gap calculation of support would be calculated under paragraphs 10 and 11 of Annex 3 of the Agreement on Agriculture on "non-exempt direct payments," not paragraph 8 on "market price support." That said, the calculations to quantify the support under these provisions are similar. Under paragraph 10, "non-exempt direct payments which are dependent on a price gap shall be calculated either using the gap between the fixed reference price and the applied administered price multiplied by the quantity of production eligible to receive the administered price, or using budgetary outlays."

33. Under the 1990 Act, only production produced on cotton base acres or other programme crop
base acres was eligible for marketing loans. Based on the 1992 Compliance Report (Exhibit US-39),
11,164,726 acres programme acres were planted to upland cotton. Based on an average crop yield of 694 pounds per acre38, 7,748,319,844 pounds or 16,142,333 480-lb bales, would have been eligible
for marketing loans in 1992.

34. Under provisions of the 1996 farm bill, upland cotton planted on farms with any programme crop base were eligible for marketing loans. While production data are not collected by the Farm Service Agency, the following quantities of upland cotton were put under loan or collected a loan deficiency payment in 1999, 2000, 2001 and 2002.

35. Thus, compared to MY1992, the quantity of cotton placed under marketing loans or receiving loan deficiency payments in MYs 1999, 2000, and 2002 were similar. In MY 2001, as a result of exceptional weather conditions and yields, a much larger quantity of cotton was eligible.

36. As noted above, the price gap calculation involves comparing a fixed reference price to an applied administered price. Under paragraph 11 of Annex 3, the fixed reference price "shall be based

38 See Upland Cotton Fact Sheet at 4 (Exhibit BRA-4).

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-356

on the years 1986 to 1988 and shall generally be the actual price used for determining payment rates." The applied administered price for marketing loan payments is the marketing loan rate. The fixed reference price is the average over 1986 to 1988 of the Adjusted World Price (the "actual price used for determining payment rate").
37. The average Adjusted World Price for 1986-88 was 53.65 cents per pound ­ that is, higher than the loan rate in marketing years 1992 (52.35 cents per pound), 1999-2001 (51.92 cents per pound), and 2002 (52 cents per pound). The result is that the gap between the fixed reference price and the applied administered price is always negative as would be the AMS calculation. When these price gap calculations for marketing loan payments are utilized, negative numbers result, reflecting the decrease in support from the 1986-88 level. Similarly, if the applied administered price for marketing years 1999-2002 were compared to the 1992 applied administered price, the resulting negative numbers would again show the decrease in the level of support from MY 1992. Thus, the large budgetary expenditures for marketing loan payments in recent years obscures the fact that the level of support decided by the United States had declined; the price gap calculation, on the other hand, reflects this reduction in support. As the United States demonstrated in its rebuttal submission, by calculating both deficiency payments and marketing loan payments using a price gap methodology, the upland cotton AMS reveals that in no year have the challenged US measures granted support in excess of that decided during the 1992 marketing year.39

209. It is understood that the data in the graph in paragraph 5 of the US oral statement are as at harvest time, while the data in the graph in paragraph 39 of Brazil's oral statement are as at planting time. Please explain why the trend of US acreage increase/decrease differs between these two graphs. BRA, USA

38. The planted and harvested area differ because of abandonment. Over the period 1965 to 2003, the rate of abandonment (abandoned acres divided by total acres) for US upland cotton averaged 8.3 per cent, but the rate will vary from year to year primarily because of weather, primarily in the Southwest. In 1997, for example, weather in the Southwest was generally good and the abandonment rate for that year was only 3.6 per cent. By contrast, dry weather in Texas, Oklahoma and parts of the Southeast in 1998 led many farmers to abandon their cotton crop because of poor yields, resulting in an abandonment rate of 20 per cent.

39 See US Rebuttal Submission, paras. 115. In that calculation, the United States conservatively assigned a value of zero to marketing loan payments that in every instance were negative under the price gap methodology. Had the United States used the actual negative values resulting from the calculation, the AMS would have been even smaller for those years with a lower loan rate (marketing years 1999-2001) and larger eligible production (marketing year 2001). The end result would have been the same, however: in no year would upland cotton support (as measured by an upland cotton AMS) have exceeded the 1992 marketing year level.

39. Comparing the per cent change from the prior year of planted and harvested US upland cotton acreage shows that movements in acreage figures are fairly similar, as one would expect.
210. Are worldwide planted acreage figures available? BRA, USA
40. To our knowledge, planted acreage figures are not available on a consistent basis across countries. No other sources (including ICAC) carry worldwide-planted area. Harvested area is the standard, but in reality many countries do not have a sophisticated system for data collection. To provide a comparative analysis of US acreage changes to the rest of the world, the United States has therefore used harvested acreage, the most reliable acreage measure available.
211. Brazil presents a graph in paragraph 59 of its further rebuttal submission indicating the increasing cumulative loss incurred by cotton producers. Please comment on the argument that US cotton producers could not continue operating without subsidies. In particular:
(a) to what extent does the use of 1997 survey technological coefficients with annually updated values affect the results?
41. Brazil's cost of production argument is based on erroneous facts and arguments. Brazil points to dated average total cost of production data over a randomly selected period, compares this to market revenue, and proclaims that any "gap" must be covered by subsidies. The United States has identified several fatal conceptual and factual flaws in Brazil's analysis.40 For example, Brazil ignores the evidence on record that a significant number (approximately 47 per cent) of traditional (and likely high-cost) upland cotton producers no longer plant upland cotton. This structural shift in
40 US Further Rebuttal Submission, paras. 105-51.

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-358
the industry is not reflected in cost of production data. In addition, Brazil treats the only sources of farm income as cotton market prices and government payments, ignoring crop diversification and off-farm sources of income. By ignoring alternative revenue sources, Brazil invalidates its claim that only government payments could serve to cover any alleged cost-revenue gap.
42. But most importantly, Brazil has no legal basis for its argument. Brazil argues that the Appellate Body in Canada - Dairy (21.5) has stated that total costs are the relevant measure, but that reasoning is inapt here. The only question in that dispute was whether a practice involved an export subsidy within the meaning of Article 9.1(c) of the Agriculture Agreement. Solely because the question was to determine whether certain milk provided to processors constituted a payment for purposes of Article 9.1(c) did the Appellate Body opt to use the average cost of production.41 However, the Appellate Body explicitly recognized that "a producer may well decide to sell goods or services if the sales price covers its marginal costs." The Appellate Body also noted that cost of production can be measured "in at least two ways": (1) per unit average total cost of production and (2) marginal cost of production.42 Here, the issue for which Brazil seeks to use total costs is not whether a subsidy exists but to evaluate the effect of the subsidy, an altogether different analysis. Thus, Canada - Dairy (21.5) provides no support Brazil's average total cost argument.
(a) to what extent does the use of 1997 survey technological coefficients with annually updated values affect the results?
43. As described in detail in previous US submissions43, the combination of, among other things, the boll weevil eradication programme and the extraordinary adoption rates of biotech cotton have combined to lower producers' costs and enhance net revenues. Despite the difficulty in providing precise figures on the extent of cost savings and net revenue increases for the cotton sector that have occurred since the 1997 USDA ARMS cost and returns survey, the rapid adoption of biotech cotton (over 90 per cent of area in key producing States) suggests farmers are reaping significant benefits in terms of net returns. These cost savings have been analyzed and documented in a wide range of studies.
44. In June 2002, the National Center for Food and Agricultural Policy (NCFAP) compiled 40 case studies of 27 crops to document the benefits of biotechnology.44 These case studies were done by various universities. Among other findings, one study found that adoption of insect resistant biotech cotton in states in the Southeast and Southwest experiencing high infestations of budworm resulted in a $20 per acre increase in net income. Another study that examined the use of herbicide-resistant cotton in several Mid-South states estimated producers saved $133 million annually in weed control costs.
45. The post-1997 updates of the cost of production data assume the same technological coefficients as the 1997 survey ­ for example, pounds of seed per acre, the number of pesticide applications per acre, etc. Brazil correctly notes that the ERS/USDA updated COP data from 1997 show increased seed costs, which reflects the use of higher-cost biotech seed.45 To the extent those inputs become more costly (for example, as biotech seed replaces conventional), cost increases are captured by the updating process through input price indexes. What is not captured is the cost savings from technological changes that alter the mix of production activities and inputs. New survey data
41 The specific issue addressed was limited to whether the supply of certain milk to processors constituted a "payment" on the export of milk "financed by virtue of governmental action."

will incorporate new technological coefficients as well as changes in such practices as direct pesticide costs, changes in tillage, application and cultivation trips, and handweeding. Many of the cost-saving aspects of biotechnology or other new practices (no-till farming) cannot be accurately captured by simply updating old cost data by price indices. Thus, relying on such updated cost data that reflects an outdated technological mix is in error.

(b) to what extent do producers base planting decisions on their ability to cover operating costs but not whole farm costs? USA

46. As explained in some detail in the US Further Rebuttal Submission of 18 November, the
agricultural economics profession is clear that short-run production decisions are made based on the ability of a producer to cover his variable or operating costs.46 All economic models that attempt to
capture supply response (producer planting behaviour) use variable costs in the equations, not total
costs. Examples include the FAPRI baseline projections model (a variation of which was used by Dr.
Sumner), the ERS baseline projections model, and the Economic Research Service's FAPSIM model, the results of which are cited by Brazil.47 No economic model of which we are aware looks to total
costs as the relevant costs for producer planting decisions.

47. One can do the same exercise as done by Brazil in paragraph 59 of its further rebuttal submission, but using the economically correct variable costs instead of total costs.48 Even using the
technologically- and structurally-dated cost-of-production data based off the 1997 ARMS survey, in
all years except the extraordinary year of 2001, average market returns more than covered variable
costs, allowing producers to earn a sufficient margin to pay off other fixed costs, a conventional agricultural business practice, as noted by Christopher Ward.49 Instead of a cumulative loss of
$332.79 per acre over the 6-year period as claimed by Brazil, producers had a cumulative net margin
of $592.65 per acre. Clearly, if all years were like 2001, US cotton farmers would go out of business.50 But because most US cotton farmers regularly cover their variable costs ­ and then some
­ they can survive a year like 2001.

46 US Further Rebuttal Submission, 18 November 2003, para. 117. Brazil continues to inappropriately

make all its cost-revenue arguments using total costs. Brazil cites the Appellate Body decision in Canada ­

Dairy 21.5 III as support for using a total cost of production figure but that decision was unique to those

circumstances and involved export subsidies. That decision does not refute accepted wisdom and long-standing

economic theory, as well as farmers' usual business practices. 47 Exhibit Bra-222. 48 See http:/www.ers.usda.gov/data/costsandreturns/. 49 Further Rebuttal Submission of Brazil, 18 November 2003, para. 58. 50 Even Mr. Christopher Ward was unable to cover his variable costs in 2001.

212. Brazil states in paragraph 37 of its oral statement that studies of Westcott and Price found that the effect of the programme on cotton is to add an additional 1 to 1.5 million acres during marketing years 1999-2001 and to suppress US prices by 5 cents per pound. Does the US reject these findings? Why or why not?

48. While an interesting "academic" analysis of the impacts of the US marketing loan programme, the Westcott and Price study Analysis of the US Commodity Loan Programme With Loan Provisions (Exhibit BRA-222) is not relevant for the Panel's assessment of the matter before it. In this study acreage decisions are based on an expected net returns which includes as the expected price term as the higher of the lagged market price or the loan rate plus additional marketing loan facilitated revenue. Since the period of analysis for the study is 1998 through 2005, rather than actual data, the authors used USDA's 2000 baseline. This baseline incorporates actual data for years prior to marketing year 1998 and partial marketing year 1999 to make projections about prices and other factors for marketing year 1999 forward. Thus the study is based on projections except for MY1998.51

49. A panel, however, cannot base its findings on hypothetical market conditions instead of actual conditions. That is, Brazil must show that US domestic support has actually caused serious prejudice in a given year based on actual market conditions and not that under some assumed conditions US domestic support programmes have impacted prices. Since the study is based on projected prices, the analysis is not useful for the Panel in determining whether US support programmes have caused serious prejudice to Brazil.

50. Putting aside the issue that the study is based on projections and not actual market conditions for the 1999-2001 period, the United States believes the study results overstate the impacts of the US marketing loan programme for two reasons: (1) the expectation of prices used and (2) the overstated additional marketing loan facilitated revenue.

51. As previously discussed, the authors used USDA's 2000 baseline as the input into the USDA FAPSIM model. To represent farmers' price expectations, the simulation uses lagged prices from the projections in the USDA's 2000 baseline. The model uses the higher of lagged market prices or the loan rate plus additional marketing loan facilitated revenue (fixed at 14 cents per pound for cotton). Using the price projections in the USDA 2000 baseline, farmers would expect the marketing loan programme to kick in for the period 1999-2001. The problem here is that the price expectations used by the model are not consistent with the price expectations the farmers actually held at the time of planting for prices at harvest. As the United States provided in its opening statement at the Second Meeting of the Panel with the Parties, the futures prices at the time of planting indicated that prices would be above the marketing loan rate during this period.

51 In fact, the study found marketing loans to have negligible impacts in 1998. See Exhibit BRA-222, p. 16.

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-361
As the futures prices demonstrate, market expectations at the time of planting for marketing years 1999-2001 was that prices would be above the marketing loan rate and hence no marketing loan benefits. Therefore, the marketing loan programme would not have had the impact this study found.
52. In addition to having the wrong expectations about price levels and the marketing loan programme being tripped, the study has overstated the potential additional market loan facilitated revenue that can be achieved. The authors used a fixed rate of 14 cents to represent this additional revenue above the loan rate when the marketing loan programme kicks in. Their justification for this figure is that this was their calculation for 1998. The authors do not provide any discussion as to why conditions in 1998 were indicative of conditions to continue for the near future that would keep this margin at 14 cents. This margin is based on the fact that farmers can pick the date to make the claim for the marketing loan gain/deficiency payment and then sell the cotton at a later date. The premise is that a farmer is able to sell when prices have increased relative to the date they made their claim. However, in reality, there is no such guarantee. It is just as possible that prices will fall below the price when the claim was made. In fact, the additional revenue has not been as large as in MY1998.52 In MY1999, the annual average was 6.1 cents, MY2000 was 5.8 cents, and MY2001 was 1.3 cents. As Exhibit US-126 demonstrates, the margin fluctuates from month to month, with the value in several months even negative, implying that a farmer that did not sell his crop at the time he received the marketing loan payment earned less than the marketing loan rate. Using a much lower value for this additional revenue above the loan rate when the marketing loan rate kicks in would have reduced the impact of the study's result.
53. By request of the Payment Limitations Commission, Westcott and Price updated this analysis using actual prices for MY2001. As the United States has discussed at the panel meetings and in its further rebuttal submission, this will overstate the impact of the marketing loan programme because it assumes that farmers had perfect foresight. That is, the model is calibrated to the actual values that occurred in that year while, in fact, producers could not have anticipated such events when planting decisions occurred. This overstates the effects of the programme because the model assumes outcomes that were unanticipated by producers when they made their planting decisions.
54. This overstatement is similar to the other third party studies that used actual outlays for marketing loans when calculating the price wedge. As the United States argued when critiquing those models, a more appropriate method to determine the impact is to look at expectations based on futures prices relative to the marketing loan rate. If the futures prices are above the loan rate, the programme will have a negligible impact on planting decisions since farmers are not expecting benefits from the programme.
55. For these reasons, the United States finds the results from these studies not relevant for the Panel in making its assessment of the effect of the marketing loan programme.
213. What differences, if any, can be observed in the results of econometric models in the literature which use lagged prices and those which use futures prices to analyse the effect of prices on planting decisions? BRA, USA
56. In this dispute two approaches have been advocated in determining farmers' expectations about prices. Brazil and its economic consultant have used lagged prices as the mechanism to gauge farmers' expectations about prices. Dr. Sumner wrote:
Of course, it is impossible to know precisely what individual growers expect. I have adopted the long-standing approach of FAPRI, and other models[,] to approximate
52 See Exhibit US-126 for calculations using the authors' formulation of the additional marketing loan facilitated revenue realized per unit for MY 1998-2003 (partial year), using actual data.

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-362
these expectations by using the current year final realized market prices as the expectation for the following season's price.53
The lagged prices used by Brazil and its economic consultant can at best, be an approximation of farmers' price expectations. That is because the lagged prices used in Brazil's analysis incorporate pricing information that occurs after US farmers make their planting decision (that is, prices from April through July of a given marketing year when planting decisions are taken in the January to March period). Therefore, by necessity, farmers cannot be looking at a lagged price that incorporates prices that do not yet exist.
57. The United States, on the other hand, has advocated the use of futures prices, a market determined expectation of prices. As Mr. MacDonald, Brazil's own witness, has explained, the New York futures price is a key mechanism used by cotton growers, traders and consumers in determining current market values as well as the contract prices for forward deliveries, in the domestic US and non-US markets.54
58. The use of futures by market participants is supported by a US government study. In April 1999, the US General Accounting Office published a report on farmers' use of risk management strategies.55 Based on survey data from the 1996 USDA Agricultural Resource Management Study, the study showed that between 35 and 57 per cent of cotton farmers used a hedging instrument in 1996. (The ranges reflect a 95 per cent confidence interval.) In addition, an estimated 63 to 89 per cent of cotton farms used cash forward contracts in 1996.56 These survey results suggest that a large proportion of cotton farmers either directly or indirectly price their cotton off of organized futures and options markets.
59. Furthermore, economic literature supports the United States' approach. For example, in his classic paper on rational price expectations, Muth (Exhibit US-48) argued that there is little evidence that expectations based on past prices are economically meaningful. Additionally, in a 1976 paper Gardner (Exhibit US-49) contended that the future price for next year's crop is the best proxy for expected price.
60. Unfortunately, the use of futures prices in a multi-commodity modelling framework for extended time projection is cumbersome. First, equations must be developed that can predict values for futures contracts in simulation analysis. Second, many commodities lack an organized futures exchange (e.g., grain sorghum). For these reasons, large-scale models like those used by FAPRI, USDA and the US Congressional Budget Office typically use lagged prices rather than futures prices as proxies for price expectations.
61. Nonetheless, the use of lagged prices may result in biased results. Over the long term, where there is reasonable stability in markets, lagged prices function adequately as a proxy for price expectations. However, in those years, as in the period under investigation here, when unexpected exogenous shocks such as China dumping stocks and unexpected yields worldwide due to good weather conditions, lagged prices are poor predictors of expected prices. Future prices, by contrast, are more efficient because they are based on more current information.

Agriculture in Transition: Farmers' Use of Risk Management Strategies. GAO/RCED-99-90. April 1999. See page 9, table 4 (Exhibit US-125). 56 A forward contract is defined as a cash market transaction in which two parties agree to buy or sell a commodity or asset under agreed-upon conditions. For example, a farmer agrees to sell, and a ginner or warehouse agrees to buy, cotton at a specific future time for an agreed-upon price or on the basis of an agreed on pricing mechanism (such as a futures or options market). See Exhibit US-125, page 22.

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-363

62. For example, during marketing years 2000, 2001, 2002, and 2003, lagged prices significantly understate the harvest season prices expected by producers as seen in the futures prices at the time of planting. The use of lagged prices thereby inflate the effect of the marketing loan rate. In fact, those lagged prices would have to be increased by 8-25 per cent, depending on the year, to equal the harvest season price actually expected by producers as indicated by the futures price.57 For the period MY 1999-2003, only MY 2002 exhibits expected prices below the marketing loan rate when using futures prices. However, over that same period, when lagged prices are used as expected prices, the loan rate is higher than the expected price in every year over this period except MY1999. Thus, it is a significant error for Brazil and Dr. Sumner to use lagged prices instead of the futures prices Brazil's own expert explained to be the more accurate gauge of farmers' price expectations.

63. Looking more specifically at Dr. Sumner's analysis in Annex I provides further evidence of the bias of lagged prices relative to future prices. Consider the 2002 crop year. In the Sumner analysis, area response to the removal of the cotton loan programme results in a 36 per cent reduction in US planted area ­ the largest single effect for any of the years considered in his analysis. Based on lagged prices, price expectations for 2002 were 29.8 cents per pound, a 40 per cent reduction from 2001 levels. Yet, the futures market data suggests a far smaller reduction in expected price. December futures prices taken as the average daily closing values in February 2002 averaged 42.18 cents per pound, a 28 per cent drop from year earlier levels. Based on Dr. Sumner's range of supply response elasticities of 0.36 to 0.47, a decline of this magnitude would suggest a drop in acreage of 10 to 13 per cent from the preceding year. In fact, actual US cotton acreage dropped 12 per cent (from 15.5 million acres in 2001 to 13.7 million acres in 2002) suggesting acreage levels entirely consistent with world market conditions and price expectations. Thus, in marketing year 2002, lagged prices would significantly overestimate the decline in plantings in the absence of a marketing loan rate.

64. While the United States would agree with Brazil that it is impossible to know precisely what individual farmers' price expectations are, the United States argues that futures prices provide the most current expectations of market participants. The United States disagrees with the approach used by Brazil in its analysis to rely solely on lagged prices and ignore information provided by futures prices. While it may be impractical to include futures prices in some models, modelling convenience is no justification to ignore these objective, market-based price expectations, and the biased results from using lagged prices do not assist the Panel in making an objective assessment of what is the effect of the US marketing loan programme.

C. DOMESTIC SUPPORT
214. Please provide a copy of regulations regarding the marketing loan programme and loan deficiency payments published at 58 Federal Register 15755, dated 24 March 1993. What does this regulation indicate about the target price? USA
65. Please see US Exhibits 117 and 118. In these document, the Department of Agriculture set the level of support for the 1993 marketing year. For example, the Department announced a marketing loan rate of 52.35 cents per pound. In addition, the Secretary did not exercise his discretion to alter the effective price, which by statute was to be "not less than" 72.9 cents per pound.59 We also note that the March 24 notice lowered the acreage reduction percentage (the share of base acreage on which deficiency payments could not be obtained) from 10 to 7.5 per cent.
215. Please expand or comment on the statement at paragraph 91 of the US further rebuttal submission that the counter-cyclical target price ceases to be paid when the farm price rises above 65.73 cents per pound. In this scenario, should the Panel disregard Direct Payments? BRA, USA
66. Direct payments are made to producers regardless of the price level; no production of upland cotton or any other crop is required to receive payment, and the recipient may additionally leave the land in conserving use. In contrast, the counter-cyclical payment is contingent on farm prices falling below the target price of 72.4 cents per pound less the direct payment rate of 6.67 cents per pound. Thus, at farm prices near to or over the 65.73 cents threshold, the counter-cyclical payment will be reduced or eliminated.
216. How many times have upland cotton producers been able to update their base acres since 1984? How do upland cotton producers come to note the possibility of future updating? Please provide examples of relevant material. BRA, USA
67. Under the 1990 Act, base acreage for purposes of deficiency payments was calculated as the average, minus the high and low year, of the previous five years plantings. There was no updating of base acres by upland cotton producers since the base period was always a rolling average of the previous five years. In effect, to increase acreage base, a producer had to overplant his or her current acreage base. The 1990 Act penalized producers who overplanted their base by declaring them ineligible for farm programme payments in the year they overplanted their base. For this reason, participation in the programme was quite high.
68. The 1996 Act eliminated deficiency payments in favour of decoupled production flexibility contract payments. The Act also did away with the rolling five-year average approach for base acreage. Instead, crop base acreage was based on the amount of base acreage that would have been in effect under the 1990 farm bill for the 1996 crop year. Producers maintained the same acreage base over the 1996 through 2001 crop years, without current plantings affecting their base acreage.
69. The 2002 Act allowed producers either to retain base acreage as under the production flexibility contracts or to update their base area equal to the average acreage planted and prevented in 1998-2001. The latter option allowed decoupled payments to be made with respect to soybeans and other oilseeds, which did not have base acreage under the 1990 Act. This new crop acreage base cannot be updated as it extends for the life of the 2002 Act (that is, through the 2006 crop year).
70. We note that the likelihood of further base updating would appear small. Currently, there is no authority for future base updating. Any changes would have to originate in Congress where there
59 7 USC 1444-2 (Exhibit US-5).

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-365
would likely be an associated budgetary cost. Given the current US fiscal situation, increases in the agricultural budget are seen as unlikely.
217. What is the reason for reducing payments under the PFC and direct payments programmes for planting and harvesting fruit, vegetables and wild rice on certain base acreage? Please comment on the statements by the European Communities that "the reduction in payment for fruit and vegetables, if the EC understands correctly, is in fact designed to avoid unfair competition within the subsidising Member." (EC oral statement at first session, first substantive meeting, paragraph 29) and "To find otherwise would not permit a WTO Member wishing to introduce decoupled payments to take account of important elements of internal competition (...)" (EC response to Panel third party Question No. 5).
71. The limitation only applies to base amounts of acreage, and to that end it is worthy of note that the US December 18-19 filings indicate that cotton farms plant less than one-third of their total cropland to cotton. Of note, too, is that fruit and vegetable prohibition came into play before 1996 in connection with the "flex acre" concept of the 1990 farm bill as reflected in the provisions of 7 USC 1464 (1988 ed. Supp. III) as enacted at that time. It continues to be the case under the 1996 and 2002 Farm Bill, as with the 1990 Bill, that the restrictions on plantings is only limited to the base acres amount of the farmer's cropland.
72.
73. Paragraph 6 prohibits basing payments on production requirements, not basing payments on not producing. As the United States earlier pointed out, consider a situation in which a recipient of direct payments produces fruits and vegetables and sees the direct payment reduced. How could that recipient receive the entire payment to which he or she is entitled? The marginal amount of decoupled payment is not "related to, or based on, the type or volume of production" undertaken by the producer since the recipient need not produce anything at all. Rather, to receive the marginal payment, the recipient need merely refrain from producing fruit, vegetables, or wild rice. Thus, the extra amount of payment is not "related to, or based on" production; if anything, it is "related to, or based on" non-production (of certain crops).
218. Please comment on the testimony of USDA Chief Economist Keith Collins cited in paragraph 36 of Brazil's oral statement regarding the trade-distorting and production-distorting nature of the marketing loan payments.
74. We agree with the statement of Dr. Collins that marketing loan payments are potentially production- and trade-distorting. The United States has consistently notified upland cotton marketing loan payments as cotton-specific amber box payments in its WTO Domestic Support notifications. The issue in this dispute is not whether marketing loan payments are potentially production- and trade-distorting, but the degree to which they have actually distorted production and trade in a particular year, given market prices and other relevant factors.
75. The degree of distortion caused by the marketing loan programme depends on the relationship of the expected harvest price to the loan rate at the time of planting. If the expected price is below the loan rate, the loan rate may provide an incentive to plant cotton because farmers will receive a

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-366
government payment for the difference between the loan rate and the adjusted world price. For this reason, we believe that the marketing loan programme was more distorting in 2002 when expected cash prices were below loan rates at planting than in 2001, when expected cash prices were higher than loan rates at the time of planting. However, as explained previously, the observed decline in upland cotton planted acreage in marketing year 2002 was commensurate with the decline in futures prices over the year before.
D. EXPORT CREDIT GUARANTEES
219. Under the Agreement on Agriculture the general position is that the use of export subsidies, both those listed in Article 9.1 as well as those within the scope of Article 1(e) which are not so listed, may only be used within the limits of the product specific reduction commitments specified in Part IV of Members' Schedules. One might therefore have expected that Article 3.3 of the Agreement on Agriculture would have prohibited the use of both listed and non-listed export subsidies in excess of reduction commitment levels in the case of scheduled products and, in the case of non-scheduled products, would have simply prohibited the use of any export subsidy. Instead, the Article 3.3 prohibition is limited in both cases to export subsidies listed in Article 9.1. What significance, if any, does this contextual aspect have for how Article 10.2 might be interpreted having regard, inter alia, to:
(a) the fact that export performance-related tax incentives, which like subsidised export credit facilities were considered as a possible candidate for listing as an Article 9.1 export subsidy in the pre-December 1991 Draft Final Act negotiations, have been held (for example, in United States - Tax Treatment for Foreign Sales Corporations, WT/DS108) to be subject to the anti-circumvention provisions of Article 10.1; and
(b) the treatment of international food aid and non-commercial transactions under Article 10? USA
76. The United States has previously noted the unremarkable fact that Article 9.1 of the Agreement on Agriculture sets forth a list of six very specific practices known to the drafters and deemed to constitute export subsidies under that Agreement.60 The specific identification and description of these export subsidy practices, well-known and notorious in the agricultural trade sector, served at least three purposes in the text. First, under Article 3.3, these particular practices were unambiguously subject to the export subsidy reduction commitments of each member.
77. However, certain limited exceptions to this rule constitute the second and third purposes of the specific list of export subsidies in Article 9.1: Article 3.3 is by its terms "subject to the provisions of paragraphs 2(b) and 4 of Article 9." Article 9.2(b) has since lapsed, but while in effect permitted a Member to provide export subsidies listed in Article 9.1 in a given year in excess of the corresponding annual commitment levels in the Member' s schedule, subject to the cumulation limits of Articles 9.2(b)(i)-(iv). Under Article 9.4, during the implementation period, developing country Members were not required to undertake export subsidy commitments with respect to export subsidies listed in Articles 9.1(d) and 9.1(e), except not to apply them in a manner that would circumvent their reduction commitments.
78. Unlike export performance-related tax incentives, which are not expressly mentioned in the Agreement on Agriculture, export credit guarantees were subject to an altogether separate treatment and commitment: exclusion from the export subsidy disciplines altogether until agreement on
60 US First Written Submission (11 July 2003), para. 161.

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-367
internationally agreed disciplines. Under Article 10.2, Members were (and continue to be) obligated to work toward the development of such disciplines, and once agreed, adhere to them.
79. Question 219 suggests one might have expected Article 3.3 to have prohibited the use of both listed and non-listed export subsidies in excess of reduction commitment levels in the case of scheduled products and, in the case of non-scheduled products, to have simply prohibited the use of any export subsidy. Article 8, however, serves this specific role. It imposes the obligation not to provide export subsidies otherwise than in conformity with the Agreement on Agriculture and with the commitments specified in the respective Members' schedules.
80. The anti-circumvention provisions of Article 10.1 further highlight the separate treatment of export credit guarantees. That article explicitly recognizes that "non-commercial transactions" shall not be used to circumvent export subsidy commitments. This phraseology is distinctly similar to that of item (h) in Addendum 10, entitled "Export Competition: Export Subsidies to be subject to the terms of the Final Agreement," dated August 2, 1991, among the series of addenda to the Note on Options circulated by Chairman Dunkel.61 That item(h) addressed: "Export credits provided by governments or their agencies on less than fully commercial terms."
81. However, instead of making any connection between "non-commercial transactions" and export credits, the Members agreed in the very next section - Article 10.2 as ultimately adopted - to provide wholly distinct treatment to export credits, export credit guarantees and insurance. The reference to circumvention for non-commercial transactions in the current Article 10.1 would have been the obvious place to draw the distinction that New Zealand and Brazil claim the Members allegedly made between "commercial" and "non-commercial" export credits.62 But the text simply does not support this fictional argument.
82. Article 10.4 provides further support that export credits are part of a work programme to develop disciplines for them and consequently are not currently subject to the other disciplines of Article 10. Article 10.4 of the Agreement on Agriculture ties the discipline on food aid to terms negotiated elsewhere: the Food Aid Convention and the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). This specific set of disciplines applicable to food aid demonstrate the situation that will apply once the negotiations mandated under Article 10.2 are completed. They also illustrate an approach comparable to the negotiations that subsequently occurred in the OECD and as contemplated in paragraph 5 of Attachment 5 of the Harbinson Text.63 Once internationally agreed disciplines are achieved, then it will be possible for a given export credit practice to circumvent export subsidy disciplines as a result of failure to comply with the export credit disciplines.64
221. In respect of the table in paragraph 161 of the US August 22 rebuttal submission (concerning the cohort specific treatment of export credit guarantees), the Panel notes the subsequent US agreement (footnotes 82 and 96 in US further submission of 30 September 2003; footnote 160 in US 18 November further rebuttal submission) to Brazil's assertion (footnote 67 in Brazil's 27 August 2003 comments on US rebuttal submission) that the total figure net of re-estimates should be $230,127,023 instead of the figure which originally appeared ($381,345,059).
(a) Please submit a corrected table reflecting all of the necessary information to produce this result, to the extent this is possible for the reasons indicated in footnote 96 in US further submission of 30 September 2003.

(b) Please clarify whether and how the Panel should treat the figures in Exhibit BRA-182 for the net lifetime re-estimates for each respective cohort.
83. The United States has no objection to use of the figures in the column entitled "Net lifetime reestimate amount" in Exhibit Bra-182 in lieu of the column entitled "Reestimates" in the table that accompanied paragraph 161 of the US Rebuttal Submission (22 August 2003) and reproduced in the response to question 221(a) immediately above. The figures are intended to represent the same thing.
84. The Panel will first note that with respect to the figures corresponding to cohorts 1997-2002, Exhibit Bra-182 and the table previously submitted by the United States match.
85. Differences appear with respect to cohorts 1992-1996. The United States attempted to explain the disparity in footnote 96 of its Further Submission of 30 September 2003. These differences would appear to be related to the cumulative re-estimates applied to these cohorts within the calculations of the budgets in fiscal years 1993-2000. The United States noted that it was searching for internal documentation to corroborate the figures included in the table previously submitted to the Panel. In the absence of such documentation and unable to explain the relatively minor disparity in figures, the United States necessarily accepts Exhibit Bra-182.
86. In fact, the United States' initial figures were more conservative than these official figures which show profitability in every year during the period 1992-1996. The following table illustrates this result:

These figures show that all of the first five cohorts (1992-1996), including 1994, are profitable. The figures for these years, unlike the more recent cohorts, reflect much more complete data for actual operating experience (although 1999 is already showing profitability).
(c) The Panel notes that the CCC 2002 financial statement in Exhibit BRA-158 refers to annual "administrative" expenses of $4 million, and that the US has also referred to this figure in its submissions (e.g. US first written submission, paragraph 175). Please confirm whether the figures in the table in paragraph 161 of the US August 22 rebuttal submission (or a corrected version thereof) includes "administrative expenses", of approximately $4 million per year over the period 1992-2002, and explain why (or why not) this affects the substantive result.
87. The figures in the table in paragraph 161 do not include administrative expenses. Imputed administrative costs are not subject to the re-estimation process but are reflected separately in the budget.65 The United States has previously acknowledged that it would be appropriate to apply an administrative expense as an operating cost of the programme.66 Consequently, it would be appropriate to add the administrative expense applicable to a particular cohort as an operating cost.
(d) Please identify what is considered an "administrative expense" for this purpose.
88. The Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) has no physical presence. It also has no employees. The "administrative expense" in the budget is simply a reasonable approximation for budgetary purposes of the value of services supplied by US Department of Agriculture agencies and personnel in the administration of this particular programme subsumed within the CCC.
89. The relevant provision from the applicable appropriations legislation for fiscal year 2003 reads as follows:
COMMODITY CREDIT CORPORATION EXPORT LOANS PROGRAMME ACCOUNT (INCLUDING TRANSFERS OF FUNDS)
For administrative expenses to carry out the Commodity Credit Corporation's export guarantee programme, GSM 102 and GSM 103, $4,058,000; to cover common overhead expenses as permitted by section 11 of the Commodity Credit Corporation Charter Act and in conformity with the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990, of which $3,224,000 may be
65 See US First Written Submission (11 July 2003), para. 175 and fn. 160. 66 US Answers to Panel Question 77 (11 August 2003), para. 146.

transferred to and merged with the appropriation for "Foreign Agricultural Services, Salaries and Expenses", and of which $834,000 may be transferred to and merged with the appropriation for "Farm Service Agency, Salaries and Expenses."
Also, paragraph 38 of Statement of Federal Financial Accounting Standard No. 267, originally issued 23 August 199368, provides:
Costs for administering credit activities, such as salaries, legal fees, and office costs, that are incurred for credit policy evaluation, loan and loan guarantee origination, closing, servicing, monitoring, maintaining accounting and computer systems, and other credit administrative purposes, are recognized as administrative expense. Administrative expenses are not included in calculating the subsidy costs of direct loans and loan guarantees.
(e) The Panel notes the US statement in paragraph 160 of its answers to Panel questions following the first meeting that all cohorts are still open although the 1994 and 1995 cohorts will close this year. Is this still an accurate statement? If not, please indicate whether any cohorts have since "closed" for the period 1992-2002.
90. Although the United States has not completed the formal administrative steps to close cohorts 1994 and 1995, all financial transactions necessary to do so are complete. Consistent with figures reflected in the 2004 Budget Federal Credit Supplement Table 8 (Exhibit Bra-182), the net of reestimate figure for each of cohorts 1994 and 1995 will be negative, indicating profitability.
(f) The Panel notes the current "high" figures for 1997 and 1998 indicated in the original US chart. Pending their confirmation and/or updating by the US, why does the US assert that a cohort will necessarily reach a "profitable" result (for example, the 1994 cohort, which has almost closed still indicates an outstanding amount)? Do "re-estimates" reflect also expectations about a cohort's future performance?
91. Until a "closing reestimate" occurs with respect to a particular cohort, which is made "once all the loans in the cohort have been repaid or written off,"69 each reestimate does necessarily reflect certain expectations about a cohort's future performance. "Reestimates mean revisions of the subsidy cost estimate of a cohort (or risk category) based on information about the actual performance and/or estimated changes in future cash flows of the cohort."70 Generally, reestimates must be made immediately after end of each fiscal year.
92. With the passage of time, of course, each reestimate necessarily more closely reflects actual results. In the case of the GSM-102 export credit guarantee programme, for example, after three fiscal years have elapsed both the actual amount of guarantees and the actual amount of defaults are known.
93. With respect to the 1994 cohort alone, as noted in the response to Panel Question 221(b) above, the numbers from Table 8 of the Federal Credit Supplement (Exhibit Bra-182), indicate profitability. As noted in the immediately preceding response, although the United States has not
67 See Answer to Question 228, infra, regarding the Federal Accounting Standards Advisory Board 68 Statement of Federal Financial Accounting Standards No. 2: Accounting for Direct Loans and Loan Guarantees, issued 23 August 1993, pp. 187-267. (Exhibit US-127) 69 See OMB Circular A-11 (Exhibit Bra- 116), section 185.6, page 185-15. See also, US Rebuttal Submission (22 August 2003), paras. 155-156 and fn. 189; US Answers to Panel Question 81(d) (11 August 2003), paras. 162-163. 70 OMB Circular A-11 (Exhibit Bra- 116), Section 185.3(x), p. 185-12

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-371
completed the formal administrative steps to close cohorts 1994 and 1995, all financial transactions necessary to do so are complete. Consistent with figures reflected in the 2004 Budget Federal Credit Supplement Table 8 (Exhibit Bra-182), the net of reestimate figure for each of cohorts 1994 and 1995 will be negative, indicating profitability.
94. With respect to 1997 and 1998, the United States of course cannot with absolute certainty predict the future. A principal issue with respect to the 1997 cohort concerns Pakistani and Ecuadorean defaults. All of this debt has been rescheduled and is now fully performing. These rescheduled amounts currently involve approximately $209 million of outstanding principal alone. Consequently, the United States has every reason to believe that 1997 cohort will ultimately reflect profitability.
95. With respect to the 1998 cohort over $30 million of Ecuadorean and Russian (private sector) outstanding principal are in performing reschedulings.
(g) Why should the Panel "eliminate" the 2001 and 2002 cohorts from its examination, as suggested in paragraph 198 of the US further rebuttal submission?
96. The United States has previously noted that the original subsidy estimate in the US budget begins with an historically overly optimistic projection of the actual use of the programme and then the use of government-wide estimation rules is required, including mandated risk assessment country grades without regard to the actual experience specific to the CCC export credit guarantee programmes.71 The original subsidy estimate for these cohorts, like the original subsidy estimate for all cohorts, necessarily reflects no actual operating experience with respect to that cohort.
97. Subsequent downward reestimates (i.e., good performance) are calculated not from the original subsidy estimate but from the actual figure corresponding to amounts of guarantees actually issued.72 Although this budgetary convention exaggerates the apparent negative performance in all years, this exaggeration is particularly acute in the nearer term. As reflected in the table entitled "CCC Export Credit Guarantee Programme Levels - Annual President's Budgets and Actual Sales Registrations - FYs 1992-2004" accompanying paragraph 148 of the US Further Submission (30 September 2003), actual sales registrations are only reflected in budgetary figures two fiscal years following the fiscal year of the particular cohort. For the 2002 cohort, therefore, the actual sales registrations of $3,388 million contrasts with the estimated programme level of $3,926 million in the immediately preceding budget. Similarly, for the 2001 cohort, the actual figure of $3,227 million is also more than one-half billion dollars less than the anticipated programme level of $3,792 million reflected in the preceding budgets. For this reason, the tables set forth in response to questions 221(a) and 221(b) commence with an "estimate" figure corresponding to the actual level of sales registrations.
98. More significant in direct response to the question, as reflected in the tables above in response to questions 221(a) and 221(b), is the trend of negative reestimates (i.e., better than expected performance). They are uniformly large for all cohorts for 1999-2000. This trend has also commenced with respect to the 2001 cohort. It is reasonable to expect that in the fullness of time the data will similarly reflect further negative reestimates for cohorts 2001 and 2002. This is likely to become more pronounced as the terms of the guarantees issued during this time expire.
99. For the foregoing reasons, the United States submits that the current budgetary subsidy estimate figures do not accurately reflect the proper relationship of premia to long-term operating costs and losses (if any) with respect to cohorts 2001 and 2002. Although over the long-term the
71 US Further Submission (30 September 2003), paras. 147-148. 72 See US Further Submission (30 September 2003), paras. 148-149.

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-372
subsidy estimate / re-estimate process will incorporate information relating to actual operating experience, the original subsidy estimate figures in the budget do not reflect any operating experience for the respective cohort. Thus, those subsidy estimates cannot properly be used as part of an analysis of whether the export credit guarantee programmes conform to Item (j) of the Illustrative List (i.e, the sufficiency of premia to cover long-term operating costs or losses (if any)).
(h) Why should the Panel "eliminate", in addition, the 2000 cohort, as also suggested in paragraph 198 of the US further rebuttal submission for which information is presumably more "complete"?
100. The Panel is of course correct to note that the data for the 2000 cohort is necessarily more complete than with respect to the subsequent cohorts. And, as the United States would have anticipated, the large negative reestimates have commenced for the 2000 cohort. As we are now in the third month of fiscal year 2004, all outstanding GSM-102 and SCGP guarantees will have expired, and the next budget cycle reestimate process will necessarily reflect that fact.
101. The same points made in the immediately preceding response to question 221(g) apply to the 2000 cohort. Of particular note with respect to this cohort, however, is the very large difference between the original projected level of use reflected in the 2000 budget ($4,506 million) and the actual level of sales registrations reflected in the 2002 budget for that cohort ($3,082 million). This difference, approaching $1.5 billion of initially overestimated utilization, has a profound effect on the budgetary depiction of programme performance and required estimates (although the tables set forth above eliminate this distortion in the US budget by starting from the estimate figure corresponding to actual sales registrations).
(i) Under the US approach, at what point in time could a Panel ever make an assessment of the programme, if it had to wait for each cohort to be completed before it could be "properly" assessed? Why is it inappropriate for the Panel to include these "most recent years" in its evaluation, as the US suggests in paragraph 199 of its 18 November further rebuttal submission? USA
102. Fortunately, neither the Panel nor the United States has to answer this question entirely in the abstract. First, Brazil and the United States agree that an examination beyond 10 years is inappropriate.73 Indeed, as the United States has noted, to subject the programme to the analytical yoke of the unique circumstances of the Polish and Iraqi defaults over 10 years ago would effectively require elimination of the programme altogether.74 Item(j) analysis requires a certain retrospection to make the requisite comparison between premia and net operating results of the programme. The question therefore becomes at what point does the financial data yield a sufficiently accurate picture to render this judgment.
103. The United States has noted that the budgetary figures inherently tend to exaggerate negative performance of the programme. This is more pronounced in the "most recent years" for the reasons noted above. As noted in the immediately preceding sub-question(h), in the case of fiscal year 2001 and 2002 cohorts, the original budgetary subsidy estimates do not reflect any operating results of those cohorts. In contrast, cohorts 1992-1999, taken as a whole, currently reflect a net negative reestimate (i.e., profitable performance). Although it is theoretically conceivable that status could change, every indication in the trends related to the programme, including most specifically the uniform performance of reschedulings, indicate that the negative reestimates will grow, not diminish, in time.
73 The most recent manifestation is Brazil's statement in paragraph 81 of its 2 December 2003, Oral Statement: "Item(j) requires the Panel to determine whether the `programmes,' . . . charge premium rates that meet operating costs and losses over a period that the United States and Brazil agree should be 10 years."
74 US Rebuttal Submission (August 22, 2003), paras. 172-174

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-373
104. Consequently, the United States believes the Panel has sufficient data to determine that premium rates are adequate to cover long-term operating costs and losses of the programmes.
222. For GSM 102, 103 and SCGP, please provide year-by-year amounts from 1992 to 2003 with respect to: (i) cumulative outstanding guarantees; (ii) claims paid; (iii) recoveries made; (iv) revenue from premiums; (v) other current revenue, including interest earned; (vi) interest charges paid; and (vii) administrative costs of running the programmes. Please indicate any allocation methodologies used to calculate administrative costs. USA
105. The chart constituting Exhibit US-128 sets forth the information requested. This data is current through November 30, 2003. As the Panel will note, claims outstanding plus interest and administrative expenses are now well below premia plus interest otherwise collected or earned. This current data clearly reflects that premia are adequate to cover long-term operating costs and losses.
106. For each of cohorts 1992-1996, $3 million of administrative costs are allocated. For each subsequent cohort, $4 million of such costs are allocated. These are the figures reflected in the table accompanying paragraph 132 of Brazil' s Oral Statement of July 22, 2003, and the corresponding references to the US budget cited therein. As Exhibit US-128 breaks out activity for each of GSM-102, GSM-103, and SCGP, these respective administrative costs have then been allocated based on the relative registration values of these programmes. Interest costs and revenue (see response to question 224 and table therein) have similarly been allocated based on registration value.
223. Are the premium rates applicable to GSM 102, 103 and SCGP subject to regular review as to their adequacy in enabling the operating costs and losses associated with these programmes? If so, what criteria or benchmarks are taken into consideration for this purpose? Secondly, how do the premium rates applied compare with the implicit cost of forfaiting transactions and with premiums for export credit insurance? USA
107. Premium rates applicable to GSM-102, GSM-103, and SCGP are reviewed annually. The premia rates vary by programme, length of coverage, and repayment interval. For GSM-102, the premium ranges from 15.3 cents per $100 of coverage to about 66 cents per $100 of coverage. Under SCGP, a two-tier fee schedule exists. For up to 90 days, the fee is 45 cents per $100 of coverage. For 91 to 180 days, the fee is 90 cents per $100 of coverage. A higher fee structure for longer term is viewed as an incentive to exporters to opt for a shorter term and correspondingly reduce the likelihood of claims, and therefore potential operating losses, associated with the programmes. Premia for both GSM-102 and SCGP are currently subject to a statutory cap of one per cent.75
108. Private commercial quotes for export credit insurance are simply not available to the United States. As the United States has previously noted, however76, commercial insurers do offer export credit insurance covering agricultural commodities. According to a background paper on export credits prepared by the WTO Secretariat: "While guarantees could be unconditional, they usually have conditions attached to them, so that in practice there is little distinction between credits which are guaranteed and credits which are subject to insurance."77
109. With respect to forfaiting, the United States similarly does not have access to specific implicit rates available in the marketplace. The United States notes, however, that an importer does not necessarily realize any benefit from a CCC export credit guarantee. CCC has no role in the arrangements between the foreign bank issuing the letter of credit and the importer, which is typically
75 See US Answer to Panel Question 85 (11 August 2003), paras. 181-183. 76 US Answer to Panel Question 76 (11 August 2003), para. 144 77 Export Credits and Related Facilities, G/AG/NG/S/13 (26 June 2000)

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-374
the account party under the letter of credit. Consequently, the importer may have to pay its bank in full upon disbursement under the documentary letter of credit. The existence of an export credit guarantee transaction also has no necessary effect on the pricing of financing or letter of credit fees that the importer's bank may charge. In this respect, the export credit guarantee transaction is less favourable to the importer than a forfaiting transaction.78 As the United States has previously observed, forfaiting and export credit guarantee transactions compete as a method for trade financing over comparable tenors in similar markets, but it is difficult to make direct comparisons of implicit rates even among forfaiting transactions themselves.79
224. Please indicate how the CCC's cost of borrowing was treated in the 2002 financial statement of the CCC, in Exhibit BRA 158. 110. In the 2002 financial statements of the CCC, the cost of borrowing is treated as interest expense. It is included as part of the Net Cost of Operations set forth in Exhibit US-129, entitled "Commodity Credit Corporation Consolidated Statement of Net Cost (Note 13) for the Fiscal Year Ended 30 September 2002)." A separate column is presented for Foreign Programmes, of which the Export Credit Guarantee programmes are a part. Borrowing costs are subsumed within "Intragovernmental Gross Costs". CCC also earns interest on monies held by Treasury. These interest collections become a component of "intragovernmental earned revenue." The net result is the difference between these two figures in a given year. 111. With respect to the export credit guarantee programmes specifically, this "interest on debt to Treasury" and "interest on uninvested funds" are reflected in the financing account portion of each budget. As interest expense and revenue are necessarily homogenized numbers, they are not readily allocated to cohorts. Actual interest expense and revenue figures for a particular fiscal year are set forth in line 00.02 and 88.25 of the financing account provisions of each budget. The following table sets out these figures, which are also reflected in the table responding to question 222 above.

225. Please indicate whether there was any instance where the CCC "wrote off" debt and, if so, please indicate the accounting regulation or principle used. If a "written off" debt is subsequently recovered, do the CCC's accounts reflect both the interest cost and interest received in relation to the debt during the time it was "written off"? USA

112. A complete response to this question requires a vocabulary distinction between "write off" for purposes of CCC accounting and debt forgiveness. A "write off" conventionally is used to describe debt that CCC itself independently determines to be uncollectible. This determination is made by the Controller of CCC.

113. Debt forgiveness, on the other hand, refers to multilaterally agreed debt forgiveness, usually through the Paris Club, that is subsequently implemented by the United States and CCC through legislation or other internal mechanisms to eliminate the outstanding debt. As a result, in the more common parlance, that debt too is written off.

114. Historically, debt forgiveness is far larger than independent "write off." CCC has independently written off as uncollectible only approximately $190,000 of private sector debt with respect to the export credit guarantee programmes as follows:

None of the foregoing debt in either table has been recovered.
226. If a debt was "written off" more than ten years ago, does it still create a cost to the programme? If so, how is this reflected in the 2002 financial statement of the CCC, in Exhibit BRA 158 (or any other material)?
115. The provisions of the Federal Credit Reform Act first took effect with fiscal year 1992, which commenced on 1 October 1991. Write-offs before 1 October 1991 would have no continuing effect in the current financial statements of CCC, as such write-offs would have been reflected as part of the operating loss of the corporation, which in turn was replenished through the annual appropriations process in the year following such write-off.

80 This amount is approximate as it requires allocation of write off related to debt arising from various programmes.

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-378

116. Write-offs after 1 October 1991 also would not independently create an expense. Upon payment of a claim on an export credit guarantee, CCC receives a fully subrogated position to collect from the defaulting obligor. As a result, this debt is then reflected as a loan receivable for both budgetary and financial statement purposes. In accordance with paragraph 61 of Statement of Federal Financial Accounting Standard No. 2,81:
When post-1991 direct loans are written off, the unpaid principal of the loans is removed from the gross amount of loans receivable. Concurrently, the same amount is charged to the allowance for subsidy costs. Prior to the write-off, the uncollectible amounts should have been fully provided for in the subsidy cost allowance through the subsidy cost estimate or reestimates. Therefore, the write-off would have no effect on expenses.
227. The United States has indicated that Brazil continues to "mischaracterize" the amount of $411 million in the 2002 financial statement of the CCC, in Exhibit BRA 158, pp. 18 & 19. Can the United States please indicate how it believes this amount - referred to on p. 19 of the Exhibit as "Credit Guarantee Liability-End of Fiscal Year" - should be properly characterized? How, if at all, does it represent CCC operating costs or losses? USA
117. Brazil wrongly describes this amount as "record losses . . . for its guarantee programmes over the period 1992-2002."82 This figure does not represent a loss. It is a prospective estimate at a particular moment in time of anticipated experience under the programme. It is, like the budget figures, an estimate.
118. The $411 million figure is simply another manifestation of the estimate and re-estimate process required under the Credit Reform Act of 1990 and reflected in the budget figures of the United States. As a result, it is another depiction, albeit in a different format, of the results of the estimate and re-estimate process.
119. Just as the estimate figures in the budget proceed in a downward direction (i.e., good performance), one would expect this corresponding estimate figure in the CCC Financial Statements to do the same. And it does. On the corresponding page of the Notes to Financial Statements 30 September 2003 and 200283, the $411 million figure has declined to $22 million.
120. As reflected on page 1984 of Exhibit Bra-158 and on its 2003 analog, the $411 million figure and the more recent $22 million figure are the result net of "interest rate reestimate" and "technical/default reestimate". The figure, net of such total subsidy reestimates, is then brought forward to the subsequent year (as is manifest on page 19 from 2001 to 2002 and in turn from 2002 to 2003). Prior years' figures similarly brought forward are also figures net of "total subsidy reestimates".
121. Furthermore, Appendix E of the Statements of Federal Financial Accounting Concepts and Standards of the Financial Accounting Standards Advisory Board is a consolidated glossary of terms

81 Exhibit US-127. 82 The most recent example of this repeated assertion is in paragraph 84 of the 2 December 2003,

Statement of Brazil. 83 Audit Report, Commodity Credit Corporation, Financial Statements for Fiscal Years 2003 and 2002,

Note 5, page 19. (Exhibit US-129). 84 The information and format of this page are required by Statement of Federal Financial Accounting

applicable to GAAP for federal entities. That glossary defines "liability" as: "For Federal accounting purposes, a probable future outflow or other sacrifice of resources as a result of past transactions or events." Loss, on the other hand, is: "Any expense or irrecoverable cost, often referred to as a form of nonrecurring charge, an expenditure from which no present or future benefit may be expected."85 The $411 million figure in the 2002 Financial Statements and the $22 million figure in the 2003 Financial Statements describe "credit guarantee liability," not loss.
228. What accounting principles should the Panel use in assessing the long-term operating costs and losses of these three programmes? For example, if internal US Government regulations require costs to be treated differently to generally accepted accounting principles, is it incumbent on the Panel to conduct its analysis in accordance with that treatment? BRA, USA
122. Financial statements of the Commodity Credit Corporation are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), based on accounting standards promulgated by the Federal Accounting Standards Advisory Board (FASAB).86 In October, 1999, this board was designated by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) as the standards-setting body for financial statements of federal government entities, with respect to the establishment of generally accepted accounting principles. On October 19, 1999, AICPA adopted an amendment to its Code of Professional Ethics to recognize accounting standards published by the FASAB as GAAP for federal financial reporting entities. The amendment recognized FASAB as the source of GAAP for federal entities. Consequently, no incompatibility of accounting principles exists.
E. SERIOUS PREJUDICE
230. Please comment on Brazil's views on Article 6.3 of the SCM Agreement as stated in paragraphs 92-94 of its further submission. USA
123. Brazil's arguments fail to convince. First, Brazil complains that "[t]here is no valid basis for the US interpretation that the word "may" in the chapeau of Article 6.3 of the SCM Agreement [to] mean[] that a complainant - in addition to demonstrating the existence of one of the effects listed in the subparagraphs, e.g., significant price suppression - must also make a separate showing of `serious' prejudice."87 Brazil may choose to believe there is no "valid" basis, but there is a clear textual basis for the US interpretation: the ordinary meaning of the word "may."
124. The ordinary meaning of "may" is "have ability or power to; can."88 Therefore, the chapeau of Article 6.3 permits but does not require a finding that serious prejudice exists when one of the situations in Article 6.3 is demonstrated.
125. Second, Brazil argues that the use of "may" in Article 6.3 is merely intended to reflect that there are "situations in which the four enumerated types of serious prejudice exist but are not actionable." For example, Brazil points to Article 6.7, which delineates certain circumstances in which displacement or impeding of exports shall not arise, and Article 6.9, which states that Article 6 does not apply to measures that conform to the Peace Clause. Brazil's argument is badly flawed. The ordinary meaning of the chapeau to Article 6.3 does not suggest that serious prejudice must arise if one of the situations in Article 6.3 exists. If the drafters had intended merely to suggest that exceptions to Article 6.3 exist, they succeeded instead in creating a provision that does not compel
85 Statement of Federal Financial Accounting Concepts and Standards (May 2002), Appendix E, pages 1140-1141 (Exhibit US-130).
86 The website for the FASAB is www.fasab.gov. 87 Brazil's Further Rebuttal Submission, para. 92. 88 New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary, vol.1, at 1721.

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-380
any finding of serious prejudice in a circumstance in which one of the criteria under Article 6.3 is met, even when the circumstances in Articles 6.7 and 6.9 are met.
126. Indeed, the text of Article 6 does reflect Members' decision to create in Articles 6.1 and 6.2 exactly the sort of mandatory presumption / exception structure that Brazil attempts to read into Article 6.3. Article 6.1 states that "[s]erious prejudice in the sense of paragraph (c) of Article 5 shall be deemed to exist in [certain] case[s]" (emphasis added). Article 6.2 states that, "[n]otwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 1, serious prejudice shall not be found if the subsidizing Member demonstrates that the subsidy in question has not resulted in any of the effects enumerated in paragraph 3" (emphasis added). By way of contrast, Articles 6.3 and 6.7 do not use mandatory language (for example, "shall be deemed to exist" / "shall not be found") to establish a presumption / exception relationship. Rather, the language of Article 6.3 is permissive, and Article 6.7 is not expressed as an exception to a mandatory finding under Article 6.3.
127. Brazil's reference to Article 6.9 is inapt. We note that Article 6.9 does not limit its application to situations under Article 6.3. Rather, it states: "This Article does not apply to subsidies maintained on agricultural products as provided in Article 13 of the Agreement on Agriculture" (emphasis added). The language of Article 6.9 indicates that it applies to all of the provisions under "[t]his Article." Thus, according to Brazil's logic, every affirmative use of the word "shall" in Article 6 (for example, Article 6.1: "Serious prejudice shall be deemed to exist . . . ."; Article 6.4: "[D]isplacement or impeding of exports shall include . . . ."; Article 6.5: "[P]rice undercutting shall include . . . .") should have been written "may" to reflect the fact that "even where the requirements of [that provision] are fulfilled," the "subsidies are exempt from action by virtue of the peace clause of Article 13 of the Agreement on Agriculture." Those other provisions do use the term "shall," however, suggesting that the term "may" in Article 6.3 was used deliberately and according to its ordinary meaning.
128. Finally, Brazil asserts that "Article 6 is silent on the nature of the alleged additional requirements for a finding of `serious' prejudice."89 This is not wholly accurate. For example, as Question 229 from the Panel to Brazil notes, the chapeau to Article 6.3 indicates that "[s]erious prejudice . . . may arise in any case where one or several of the following apply" (emphasis added). Therefore, the Panel could conclude that where more than one prong of Article 6.3 is satisfied, the likelihood that the result is "serious prejudice" increases. Furthermore, Brazil points to additional details provided in Article 6.4 on displacement or impedance and in Article 6.5 on price undercutting as suggesting that a finding of "serious prejudice" must result if one prong of Article 6.3 is satisfied. However, Brazil draws no consequence from the lack of" detailed definitions" capable of application for Articles 6.3(a), 6.3(c) (significant prices suppression, price depression, or lost sales), or 6.3(d).
129. Finally, Brazil claims that the United States did not assert and the panel in Indonesia Automobiles did not find any separate "serious prejudice" requirement in Article 6.3. As the United States notes in its answer to Question 234, the permissive ("may") language of the chapeau to Article 6.3 would not preclude the Panel from concluding that a finding under one prong of Article 6.3 suffices to establish serious prejudice. As Article 6.8 suggests, "the existence of serious prejudice should be determined on the basis of the information submitted to or obtained by the panel" ­ that is, on a case-by-case basis. Thus, the Panel will be called upon to exercise its judgment on the quality of the evidence on causation and on the extent of any alleged effects. To reiterate one hypothetical example suggested at the second panel meeting, were a complaining party to make a prima facie case that one unit of its exports had been displaced from the market of the subsidizing Member, the situation in Article 6.3(a) would technically have been demonstrated. Such a situation, however, would lend itself to the exercise of the Panel's discretion not to find serious prejudice. This is the type of flexibility that the chapeau to Article 6.3 gives the Panel and which Brazil 's interpretation would read out of the Subsidies Agreement.

231. Do you believe that the now-expired Article 6.1 and/or Annex IV of the SCM Agreement are relevant context for the Panel's interpretation of Article 6.3? USA
130. The United States believes that both Article 6.1 and Annex IV of the Subsidies Agreement provide relevant context for interpreting "serious prejudice" within the meaning of Article 5(c) and Article 6.3. As the Panel's question notes, Article 6.1 has expired pursuant to Article 31, which established that Article 6.1 would "apply for a period of five years, beginning with the date of entry into force of the WTO Agreement," unless the Committee on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures determined to extend its application. Annex IV is entitled, "Calculation of the Total Ad Valorem Subsidization (Paragraph 1(a) of Article 6)," and by its terms establishes a methodology to calculate "the amount of a subsidy for the purpose of paragraph 1(a) of Article 6." Thus, since the provision it is meant to implement is no longer in effect, Annex IV as well is no longer directly applicable.
131. The context provided by these provisions, of course, must be judged in light of the fact that Members did not agree to extend Article 6.1(a). That is, it is highly relevant that the provision establishing a rebuttable presumption of serious prejudice upon a showing of a 5 per cent ad valorem subsidization rate was allowed by Members to lapse. On the other hand, no decision on whether to extend Annex IV was contemplated or taken pursuant to Article 31. In addition, we note that in United States ­ Countervailing Measures (EC), the Appellate Body relied on Annex IV as context in interpreting another provision of the Subsidies Agreement.90 Thus, although the underlying provision attaching a consequence to a certain subsidization rate lapsed, it is appropriate to examine how Members agreed in Annex IV a subsidy not tied to the production or sale of a given product would be allocated across the total value of the recipient's production.
132. The Panel must utilize some methodology to determine the benefit to upland cotton from a subsidy not tied to production of upland cotton. For example, Part V does not expressly set out an allocation methodology, but the same methodology of allocating an untied subsidy across the total value of the recipient's production is applied by several Members (for example, the European Communities and the United States) for purposes of their countervailing duty law. Indeed, Brazil itself has proposed in the Negotiating Group on Rules that Members adopt a "guideline" on calculating the amount of the subsidy for countervailing duty purposes precisely setting out the methodology contained in Annex IV.91 The Panel should consider whether Brazil's refusal to countenance any allocation of the decoupled payments it has challenged is credible given the fact that Brazil in its Rules proposal and Annex IV as agreed by Members both express the same approach to allocating non-tied subsidies across production. Thus, the United States believes that Annex IV continues to provide useful context for the necessary task of identifying the products that benefit from a subsidy not tied to the production or sale of a given product.
234. Does "significant" price suppression under Article 6.3(c) necessarily amount to "serious" prejudice within the meaning of Article 5(c)? Could the level of "significance" of any price suppression under Article 6.3(c) determine whether any prejudice under Article 5(c) rises to the level of "serious prejudice"?
133. "Significant" price suppression under Article 6.3(c) does not necessarily amount to "serious prejudice" within the meaning of Article 5(c). This conclusion flows from the ordinary meaning of
90 WT/DS212/AB/R, para. 112. Similarly, in United States ­ FSC: Article 22.6, Arbitrator cited the expired Articles 8 and 9 as "helpful . . . in understanding the overall architecture of the Agreement with respect to the different types of subsidies it sought and seeks to address." WT/DS108/ARB, note 56.
91 Paper by Brazil, Countervailing Measures: Illustrative Major Issues, TN/RL/W/19, at 6 (7 October 2002) ("If the benefit of a subsidy is limited to a particular product, the denominator should reflect only sales [production/exports] of that product. If this is not the case, the denominator should be the recipient's total sales.").

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-382
the text of Article 6.3(c): "Serious prejudice in the sense of paragraph (c) of Article 5 may arise in any case where one or several of the following apply." The ordinary meaning of "may" is "have ability or power to; can." Therefore, the existence of one of the situations in Article 6.3 is a necessary condition for a finding of serious prejudice but may not be sufficient.
134. Brazil argues that the use of "may" in Article 6.3 is merely intended to reflect that Article 6.7 delineates certain circumstances in which displacement or impeding of exports shall not arise. However, the ordinary meaning of the chapeau to Article 6.3 does not suggest that serious prejudice must arise if one of the situations in Article 6.3 exists. Further, the text of Article 6 reflects Members' decision to create just such a mandatory presumption / exception structure in Article 6.1 and 6.2. Article 6.1 states that "[s]erious prejudice in the sense of paragraph (c) of Article 5 shall be deemed to exist in [certain] case[s]" (emphasis added). Article 6.2 states that, "[n]otwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 1, serious prejudice shall not be found if the subsidizing Member demonstrates that the subsidy in question has not resulted in any of the effects enumerated in paragraph 3" (emphasis added). Article 6.3 and 6.7 do not use mandatory language ("shall be deemed to exist" / "shall not be found") to establish a presumption / exception relationship. Rather, the language of Article 6.3 is permissive, and Article 6.7 is not expressed as an exception to a mandatory finding under Article 6.3.
135. At the same time, the United States does not believe the text of the chapeau to Article 6.3 precludes a finding of serious prejudice where only "significant price suppression" by the subsidized product "in the same market" as a like product and no other situation in Article 6.3 has been demonstrated. Thus, it is conceivable that the effect of a subsidy could be price suppression so significant that it alone rises to the level of serious prejudice to the interests of another Member.
136. We recall that Brazil's interpretation is that price suppression would be "significant" even at a level of 1 cent per pound because this could still "meaningfully affect" its producers.92 The use of the term "significant," however, would seem to be intended to prevent insignificant price effects from rising to the level of serious prejudice. For example, were the term "significant" omitted from Article 6.3(c), any production subsidy (for example, a per-unit payment of 0.0001 cents per pound of production) would be deemed to satisfy Article 6.3(c) because any increase in production resulting from the subsidy would theoretically result in some price effect. Coupled with Brazil's reading of "may arise" in the chapeau of Article 6.3, this would result in any production subsidy running afoul of Articles 5 and 6, effectively undermining the separation of Part III of the Subsidies Agreement on "Actionable Subsidies" from Part II on "Prohibited Subsidies."
236. The Panel notes Exhibit US-47 (and the chart in paragraph 13 of the US 2 December oral statement). Please provide a conceptually analogous chart to Exhibit US-63 with respect to data relating to the US interpretation of "world market share".
137. The graph shows the year-over-year percentage change in the world market share over 1996-2002. US world market share is defined as in Exhibit US-47 as the quantity of consumption of US cotton (domestic mill use + exports) relative to world cotton consumption.
138. The annual change in the US market share is relatively slight with the exception of 1998 when severe drought, primarily in Texas, caused US production to fall significantly.

237. Could a phenomenon that remains at approximately the same level over a given period of time be considered a "consistent trend" within the meaning of Article 6.3(d)? Do parties have any suggestions as to how to determine a "consistent trend", statistically or otherwise? BRA, USA
139. It would not appear that a phenomenon (world market share) that remains at approximately the same level over a given period of time could be considered a "consistent trend" within the meaning of Article 6.3(d). This follows from the text of Article 6.3(d) itself because the "effect of the subsidy" must be an increase in world market share (as compared to the preceding three-year period), and "this increase [must] follow[] a consistent trend over a period when subsidies have been granted." Thus, if world market share remains at approximately the same level over a given period of time, the trend would not be an "increase" in world market share; hence, the trend would not be a "consistent trend" within the meaning of Article 6.3(d). And, in fact, the data do not demonstrate that US world market share has increased following a consistent trend over a period when subsidies have been granted.93
238. According to the US interpretation of the term "world market share":
(a) should the domestic consumption of closed markets be added into the denominator?
140. It is not clear from the Panel's question what is meant by "closed markets," but the US reading of Article 6.3(d) is that "world market share . . . in a particular subsidized primary product or commodity" means just that: a Member's share of the world market in, for example, upland cotton. There is nothing in the text of Article 6.3(d) that supports excluding any portion of the "world" from the analysis. For this reason, Brazil's reading of this provision as solely relating to world export trade necessarily excludes any portions of the "world market" for upland cotton that do not import, no
93 See, e.g., US Opening Statement at the Second Panel Meeting, paras. 12-13 ("That is, the facts demonstrate that since marketing year 1996, US world market share has increased and then decreased in alternating years, and US world market share in marketing year 2002 (19.6 per cent) is lower than in marketing years 1996 and 1997 (20.4 and 21.6 per cent, respectively).").

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-384
matter the size of that market. Such a result runs contrary to the ordinary meaning of the terms of the provision.
141. We note that excluding consumption from "closed markets" in the world market share calculation would increase the overall market share of the United States (and other suppliers) because the total world consumption figure would be lower. However, the variation in market share across years would not change appreciably assuming that the level of consumption in closed markets was relatively constant.
(b) if US production and consumption increased by the same percentage, whilst the rest of the world's production and consumption remained steady, would this imply an increase in the US "world market share" by a different percentage?
142. The United States interprets this question as asking whether the US market share would increase if an increase in US cotton consumption was completely supplied by increased US production without any changes to the consumption and supply patterns of the rest of the world. Under the US approach to "world market share," US world market share would increase.94 The amount of increase in the US world market share would depend largely on the size of US consumption relative to world consumption.
143. Under Brazil's approach to Article 6.3(d), however, an increase in a Member's cotton consumption that was completely supplied by increased production by that Member would result in no change in that Member's world market share since there was no change in the Member's exports. Brazil's approach, therefore, would allow a larger or even dominant cotton consumer to provide huge per-unit production subsidies that increased the share of its own domestic consumption that its producers supplied without any discipline under Article 6.3(d), regardless of the impact on other Members who could potentially supply that increasing domestic consumption. Such a result runs contrary to the ordinary meaning of "world market share" in Article 6.3(d) since the term "world market" would captures impacts both in the market of the subsidizing Member (as in Article 6.3(a)) and in third-country markets (Articles 6.3(b) and 6.3(c)).
(c) does Saudi Arabia have a small world market share for oil?
144. The relevance of this question is not entirely clear since Article 6.3(d) does not speak of "large" or "small" world market shares. That is, it is only a certain increase in world market share, from whatever level, that follows a consistent trend over a period when subsidies have been granted that is relevant to the 6.3(d) analysis.
145. Nonetheless, we note that Saudi Arabia exports crude oil but also refines petroleum into products that it consumes and refines as well. Based on 2000 world petroleum supply and disposition data for 2000, Saudi crude oil exports account for about 16 per cent of total world exports. Using an analogous measure for consumption (exports plus domestic consumption­i.e., refining­divided by total world consumption) gives a market share of 12 per cent.
239. How does the US respond to Brazil's assertions that, under the US interpretation of the term "world market share":
(a) there would be no WTO disciplines on production-enhancing subsidies that increase a Member's world market share of exports? (see paragraph 64 of Brazil's 2 December oral statement);
94 US world market share = (US domestic use of US cotton + US exports)/world consumption of cotton

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-385
(b) a Member's exports would have to be disregarded in calculating their "world market share" in terms of "world consumption"? (see e.g. paragraph 65 of Brazil's 2 December oral statement)
146. (a) We note that Brazil must repeatedly insert the term "export" into the phrase "world market share of export" or "world export share" in order to convey a meaning restricting the term "market share" to exports. That is because the ordinary meaning of "world market share" would be all those markets in which cotton is consumed. Further, Brazil's argument is overstated. There would be disciplines on production-enhancing subsidies, even those that increase a Member's world market share of exports (even though that is not an WTO obligation in and of itself). Under Article 6.3(d), for example, a Member's world market share is determined by its domestic consumption plus exports of the product it produces. If a subsidy increased the Member's exports, and domestic consumption and world consumption remained the same, the increase in the Member's exports alone would increase that Member's world market share.
147. Further, production-enhancing subsidies with export effects could be inconsistent with Article 5(a) (injury), Article 6.3(b) (displace or impede exports to third country markets), Article 6.3(c) (lost sales), or GATT 1994 XVI:1 (serious prejudice).
148. (b) It is interesting that Brazil, which roundly rejects the use of any concepts from Part V or Annex IV of the Subsidies Agreement or from the Safeguards or Anti-Dumping Agreements when these are inconvenient for it, here tries to introduce "the ordinary meaning in a trade remedy context of `domestic consumption'." The Panel's task is not to interpret the term "domestic consumption" but rather the "world market share of the subsidizing Member in a particular subsidized primary product or commodity". The United States has proposed that the US share of the world market for upland cotton must be measured by that portion of world consumption of upland cotton satisfied by US upland cotton. That necessarily must include US domestic consumption satisfied by US upland cotton. Again, we note that a relevant "market" for serious prejudice purposes is the market of the subsidizing Member under Article 6.3(a). There is no basis in the text or context of 6.3(d) to exclude that market from the "world market" identified in 6.3(d).
240. Does Article XVI:3 of GATT 1994 provide context in interpreting Article 6.3(d) of the SCM Agreement? Do these provisions apply separately? If not, could it indicate that "world market share" is intended to mean the same as "share of world export trade"?
149. GATT 1994 Article XVI:3 provides some context to reading Article 6.3(d). Both provisions are addressed to subsidies that have effects on primary products. However, the context they provide also consists of the differences in their respective texts. GATT 1994 Article XVI:3 is limited to export subsidies, as Brazil acknowledged and agreed in the Tokyo Round Subsidies Code. (Brazil does not, because it cannot, deny that in the Tokyo Round it expressed its understanding that GATT 1994 Article XVI:3 applies only to export subsidies. The Panel can judge how credible it finds Brazil's change of opinion in this dispute.) GATT 1994 Article XVI:3 relies on an "equitable share" concept that panels and Members found incapable of definition or application. Moreover, Brazil has not provided any objective definition in this dispute of the "equitable share" concept but to argue that anything other than a non-subsidized level of exports is inequitable, a reading that would convert Article XVI:3 into a prohibition on domestic subsidies with production effects.
150. Article 6.3(d) of the Subsidies Agreement, on the other hand, applies to all subsidies and has objective criteria that are capable of application. This provision sets forward a mechanical test: a Member's share of the world market for a product must be greater than preceding 3-year average, and the increase must follow a consistent trend over a period when subsidies have been granted. Therefore, there is no "inequitable share" concept to deal with, and the consistency of a Member with its obligations is a straightforward matter to determine.

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-386
151. The United States does not see any basis to say that "world market share" was intended to mean the same as the "share of world export trade". The key difference is the use of the term "market" instead of "export". The term "market" can, of course, mean a domestic market; its meaning is not limited to markets in international trade. "Export" refers to cross-border transactions; therefore, a more limited set of transactions would be of interest. As a result, the term "world market share" requires that one look at all places where upland cotton is consumed and determine what portion of world consumption of is satisfied with US upland cotton.
241. How does the US reconcile its data on consumption for 2002 in US Exhibit 40, Table 1 with the "consumption" data it refers to in its 30 September submission, paragraph 34, Exhibit US-47 or US-71? USA
152. In paragraph 34 of the 30 September submission and in the accompanying table, "consumption" is used to capture both the domestic use of raw cotton production (that is, the "mill use" figure), plus the raw cotton equivalent of textile imports (that is, how much raw cotton is incorporated into manufactured cotton textile imports). This point is crucial to understanding how the growth in cotton textile imports has contributed to the decline in consumption of US domestically produced raw cotton for domestic manufacturing, which has resulted in more US domestic cotton finding a home in off-shore markets. That is, much US domestic cotton that is exported returns to the United States in the form of textiles and apparel.95
153. In Exhibits 40, 47, and 71, the data on consumption correspond to the "mill use" data described above. The only difference is that these data are on a crop year basis (August - July). Therefore, the mill use figure in paragraph 34 of the US further submission will differ slightly from the consumption figure in the other exhibits. They are the same data, adjusted for different periods. The most recent domestic consumption (that is, mill use) figure is given in the response to Question 197.
242. How much of the benefits of PFC, MLA, CCP and Direct Payments go to land owners? If not all of the benefits go to land owners, what proportion goes to producers? USA
154. As noted in the US further rebuttal submission, the literature on direct payments suggest that a large portion of direct payments get capitalized into land values. As Burfisher and Hopkins (2003) note: "Not all operators can . . . be considered as true beneficiaries of the [PFC] programme, since competitive cropland rental markets work to pass through payments from PFC recipients who are tenants to the owners of base acres."96 Thus, the effects of increased wealth largely accrue to non-operators, and any theoretical production effects are further minimized.
155. In well-functioning markets, asset prices reflect expectations about the future returns from their ownership. The PFC programme covered a fixed number of base cropland acres, established in 1996 when farmers enrolled in the programme, and benefits did not require current production. The direct link between base acres and the known programme benefits allowed the future stream of payments to be efficiently capitalized into land values:
Decoupled payments clearly increase the well-being of the operators who receive them, but only when they are owners of base acres. Otherwise, land markets allow a pass-through of payments from operators to landowners, via modified rental
95 The data in the table in paragraph 34 are on a calendar year basis in order to match them with the import data from the US Bureau of the Census.
96 Burfisher, M. and J. Hopkins. "Farm Payments: Decoupled Payments Increase Households' Well-Being, Not Production." Amber Waves, Vol. 1, Issue 1, (February 2003): 38-45, at 44 (Exhibit US-78)

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-387
arrangements. Despite uncertainty over future policy, land values already reflect the market's expectations about future programme benefits.97
156. Land values set by sales and rental markets can be examined to see whether they track commodity price trends. If these values diverge from prices, it suggests that land markets have additionally capitalized the present and expected future value of government payments. As the figure from Burfisher and Hopkins (2003) below demonstrates, commodity prices have fallen since 1996 due to a number of factors while land values have trended upward, consistent with land capitalization of payments. Land rent data, although more fragmented, follow the same trend as land values.
157. In its 27 October answer to Question 179 and in paragraph 57 of its oral presentation of 2 December, Brazil attempts to minimize the effects of direct payments on land by citing a recent study that showed that 34-41 cents per dollar of PFC payment were capitalized into land rents in MY 1997. However, in citing this study, Brazil effectively concedes the US analysis. The study cited by Brazil analyzes cash rent data in only the first year following implementation of the 1996 Act and the decoupled production flexibility contract payments. As the authors of the study acknowledge, cash rents may be "sticky" and adjust over the long run.98 For example, not all rental contracts would be year-to-year; as additional multi-year rental contracts expire, landowners would be expected to adjust rents to capture the value of the decoupled payments made with respect to the base acreage on the land. 158. In the long run, only those upland cotton producers who are owners of upland cotton base acres will receive the benefit of those decoupled payments. Based on 1997 cost of production data, about 35 per cent of cotton production is grown by owner-operators. Therefore, only 35 per cent of the value of decoupled payments would benefit upland cotton producers, and this subsidy benefit would then have to be attributed across the total value of the recipient's production in order to determine the benefit to upland cotton.
243. Can the Panel assume that any support at all, even marketing loan programme payments, benefits upland cotton if an upland cotton producer has other agricultural production besides upland cotton? USA

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-388
159. If the United States has understood the Panel's question, the answer would appear to be no. To explain this answer, we distinguish between three types of subsidies: (1) a subsidy tied to production of upland cotton, (2) a subsidy tied to production of another commodity, and (3) a subsidy not tied to the production of any commodity. In the first case, a subsidy tied to production of upland cotton (for example, marketing loan payments) would be support to upland cotton exclusively, even if the upland cotton producer also produces other commodities. In the language of Annex IV, a subsidy that "is tied to the production or sale of a given product" is deemed to subsidize "the recipient firm's sales of that product."99 Similarly, in the second case, a subsidy tied to the production of another commodity (for example, marketing loan payments for soybeans) are deemed to benefit that commodity exclusively. Thus, such payments ­ which depend upon production of a commodity other than upland cotton ­ would not be deemed to benefit upland cotton.
160. In the third case, a subsidy not tied to the production or sale of a given product (for example, decoupled income payments) would be deemed to subsidize any product sold by the recipient. Annex IV establishes that the value of the subsidized product for such a payment is "the total value of the recipient firm's sales."100 Logically, a subsidy not tied to a particular product provides a benefit to the recipient in the form of increased income. Since money is fungible, the benefit can be deemed to inure to all of the products the recipient produces; a neutral way of attributing the subsidy to particular products is according to their proportion of the firm's sales. Thus, for purposes of Subsidies Agreement analysis, such a non-tied payment would be deemed to benefit upland cotton and any other commodity the recipient produces.
161. It is worthwhile to compare these Subsidies Agreement concepts of payments tied to productions or sale and payments not tied to production or sale to Agriculture Agreement concepts of product-specific and non-product-specific. The two sets of concepts are not identical. Recall that Article 1(a) of the Agreement on Agriculture establishes that product-specific support is "support . . . provided for an agricultural product in favour of the producers of the basic agricultural product" while non-product-specific support is a residual category of "support provided in favour of agricultural producers in general." Thus, product-specific support is "tied to the production or sale of a given product" within the meaning of the Subsidies Agreement (Annex IV, para. 3) because it must be "provided for an agricultural product" and must be "in favour of the producers of the basic agricultural product."
162. Non-product-specific support is not tied to the production or sale of a particular product since it is provided to producers in general ­ for example, decoupled payments for which the recipient need not produce any particular commodity or any commodity at all. However, as noted above, such a non-tied payment will be allocated over the total value of the recipient's production. Hence, it could be possible to derive the benefit to upland cotton for purposes of the Subsidies Agreement from non-product-specific support.
163. Brazil would take these different concepts and suggest that any support that is not tied to production must be allocated to a particular crop; such support would be "support to a specific commodity" within the meaning of the Peace Clause. However, Brazil's approach eliminates the concept of non-product-specific support for purposes of Peace Clause since a non-tied payment may always be allocated according to the recipient's production (and, in Brazil's approach, then be deemed "support to a specific commodity"). It would appear anomalous to import into Article 13 of the Agreement on Agriculture a concept from the Subsidies Agreement (that itself is only reflected in Annex IV, which Brazil does not believe is relevant to actionable subsidies claims) that renders inutile such a key concept from the Agreement on Agriculture. Such an interpretation, moreover, runs contrary to the ordinary meaning of the phrase "support to a specific commodity." As the EC pointed out, support cannot at the same time be "support to a specific commodity" and "support to multiple
99 See Subsidies Agreement, Annex IV, para. 3. 100 See Subsidies Agreement, Annex IV, para. 2.

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-389
commodities." And yet, allocating a non-tied payment across the total value of the recipient's production necessarily means that the payment is support not to a specific commodity but rather to multiple commodities (in fact, any commodities the recipient happens to produce).
164. Thus, it is important to distinguish Agreement on Agriculture concepts for purposes of Peace Clause from Subsidies Agreement concepts for purposes of identifying the amount of subsidy benefit and subsidized products. While decoupled payments ­ properly allocated ­ may provide support to upland cotton within the meaning of the Subsidies Agreement, they do not provide support to a specific commodity within the meaning of the Peace Clause. In fact, such decoupled payments provide support to any commodities the recipient happens to produce.101
245. Can a panel take Green Box subsidies into account in considering the effects of non-Green Box subsidies in an action based on Articles 5 and 6 of the SCM Agreement? BRA, USA
165. A subsidy that is green box ­ that is, conforms fully to the provisions of Annex 2 to the Agreement on Agriculture ­ is "exempt from actions based on Article XVI of GATT 1994 and Part III of the Subsidies Agreement" pursuant to Article 13(a)(ii) of the Agreement on Agriculture. Therefore, green box subsidies may not be taken into account when considering whether a Member has caused serious prejudice to the interests of another Member through the use of any other subsidy for purposes of Article 5 nor when considering the "effect of" any other subsidy for purposes of Article 6.
246. Can a panel take prohibited subsidies into account in considering the effects of subsidies in an action based on Articles 5 and 6 of the SCM Agreement? BRA, USA
166. The United States has previously indicated that it takes no position on whether prohibited subsidies may be taken into account in considering "the effect of the subsidy" under Article 6 or whether the use of any subsidy has caused adverse effects. We note, however, that there may be limited utility in making a finding that a subsidy is prohibited and then finding that that subsidy contributes to "adverse effects" or "serious prejudice." Once the DSB adopts findings that a subsidy is prohibited, the responding Member is required to withdraw the subsidy without delay under Article 4. If the same measure were to form part of findings that a Member had caused adverse effects in the form of serious prejudice, for example, the responding Member would presumably be free to argue that the withdrawal of the prohibited subsidy was sufficient to remove the adverse effects. Thus, as the Panel is charged with making findings to promote a prompt settlement of disputes, the Panel should not include any subsidy it deems to be prohibited as part off its actionable subsidy analysis.
247. Can the Panel take into account trends and volatility in market and futures prices of upland cotton after the date of establishment of the Panel? If so, how do they affect the analysis of Brazil's claim of a threat of serious prejudice? BRA, USA
167. Under its terms of reference, the Panel is called upon "[t]o examine, in the light of the relevant provisions of the covered agreements cited by Brazil in document WT/DS267/7, the matter referred to the DSB by Brazil in that document."102 Past panels have concluded that it is appropriate to look at the measures at issue in a dispute as of panel establishment. By that time, it was already
101 As the United States has noted, finding that non-tied payments, once allocated, could be "support to a specific commodity" would rob Members of the ability to design their measures to be consistent with the Peace Clause. For example, if every recipient of decoupled income support, or any other non-tied payment, decided to produce upland cotton, a Member could be deemed to have granted support in excess of that decided during the 1992 marketing year, solely as a function of producer choices, not that of the Member.
102 WT/DSB/M/145, para. 35.

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-390
evident that the challenged US measures would not pose a threat of serious prejudice. For example, the 2003 harvest season futures price at planting time ­ 59.60 cents per pound, or a 54.60 expected cash price ­ suggested that the marketing loan rate (52.00 cents per pound) would have no or minimal effect on planting decisions.103 The evidence already indicated that US acreage movements corresponded to acreage changes in the (largely unsubsidized) rest of the world.104 The evidence already indicated that direct and counter-cyclical payments have no more than minimal impacts on production and trade. Thus, by the time of panel establishment the evidence did not support a clearly demonstrated and imminent likelihood of future serious prejudice.
168. The Panel is not precluded from examining evidence subsequent to panel establishment. In fact, both Brazil and the United States have presented such evidence (of course, which cannot alter the Panel's terms of reference). For example, actual market prices and future prices for the 2003 marketing year confirm that producers are receiving higher prices for their 2003 crop and expect to continue doing so for the remainder of the marketing year. Thus, that evidence arising after panel establishment serves to confirm what prior evidence suggested: the evidence does not support a clearly demonstrated and imminent likelihood of future serious prejudice.
F. STEP 2
248. In respect of the level of Step 2 payments in certain time periods, the Panel notes, inter alia, footnote 129 in the US first written submission; footnote 33 in the US 18 November further rebuttal submission; and Exhibit BRA-350. Have Step 2 payments ever been zero since the elimination of the 1.25 cent per pound threshold in the FSRI Act of 2002? In what circumstances could a Step 2 payment be zero? How does the elimination of the 1.25 cent per pound threshold in the FSRI Act of 2002 affect your response? BRA, USA
169. Step 2 payments have been zero since the elimination of the 1.25 cents per pound threshold in the 2002 farm bill. This occurred in 5 consecutive weeks beginning 19 September 2002.
170. A Step 2 payment could be zero when the AWP exceeds 134 per cent of the base loan rate (52 cents) or the US/North Europe price is less than the Northern Europe price. If either occurs, the rate will be zero for at least 4 consecutive weeks.
171. Elimination of the 1.25 cent per pound threshold increases the range of price differences in which a step 2 payment could be triggered and raises the resulting payment by 1.25 cents. To some degree, as compared with prior years, the 1.25 cent threshold elimination may correct for some long term changes in the valuation of currencies. Further, at certain price levels where the market price used to determine countercyclical payments is above the loan rate but below 65.73 cents per pound, the additional impact that the Step 2 payment can have on the market price for US cotton can reduce the amount of countercyclical payments received by US producers.
249. The Panel notes that the definition of eligible "exporter" in 7 CFR 1427.104(a)(2) includes "a producer":
(a) How does this reconcile with Brazil's argument that Step 2 "export payments" do not directly benefit the producer? How, if at all, would this be relevant for an analysis of the issue of export contingency under the Agreement on Agriculture or the SCM Agreement? BRA
103 The futures price in the text is the average daily February closing price for the December contract. As noted in the US further rebuttal submission, para. 162 fn. 124., the January through March average daily closing price (59.10 cents per pound) is not markedly different.
104 See, e.g., US Opening Statement at the Second Panel Meeting, paras. 5-6.

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-391
(b) How does this reconcile with Dr. Glauber's statement in Exhibit US-24, p. 3 (referring to "the 1990 Farm Bill and subsequent legislation") that Step 2 payments do not go directly to the producer? USA
172. By referring to "producers" in this context, the US has referred to producers acting in their capacity as producers of cotton, that is as persons with a risk of loss in cotton that they have planted and harvested. It could be that some large producers of cotton in that sense could also be persons who are manufacturers of cotton or exporters who marketed their cotton directly overseas. In that sense, they could receive payments just as any other manufacturer or exporter could do, but they would be receiving the payment not as a producer of raw cotton but in their other capacity.
173. In short, the regulations are drafted simply to reflect that there may be many ways in which the public may organize itself, but we are assured that the same bundle of cotton will only produce one payment and the breaking of the bundle would only come in connection with the manufacturing process. Officials know of no instance in which a payment was made other than for a legitimate export or for some sort of legitimate manufacturing effort. Again, these payments are received by such persons in their other capacities and not as producers of raw cotton. Such payments simply reflect the universal application of the programme to all cotton uses without a market-interfering government restriction on who may be a manufacturer or exporter of cotton.
(c) What proportion of Step 2 "export payments" go to producers? Please supply supporting evidence. USA
174. As of the present writing, the United States does not have any data or information on how many producer/manufacturers there are, or how many producer/exporters there are. We do not think that there are many but we continue to search for additional information that might be relevant in this regard.
H. MISCELLANEOUS
253. Regarding the adjustment authority related to Uruguay Round compliance in s.1601(e) of the FSRI Act of 2002 (the so-called "circuit-breaker provision"):
(a) Does it relate to export credit guarantees, crop insurance and cottonseed payments?
175. The adjustment authority would not reach export credit guarantees, crop insurance premium payments, or the 2003 cottonseed payment. Section 1601(e) of the 2002 Act, codified at 7 USC 7991(e), states that if the Secretary determines that expenditures under subtitles A through E of Title I of the Farm Bill (which cover the "programme crops") subject to the total allowable domestic support levels under the Uruguay Round Agreements (as defined in section 2 of the Uruguay Round Agreements Act as in effect on the date of enactment of this Act) "will exceed such allowable levels for any applicable reporting period, the Secretary shall, to the maximum extent practicable, make adjustments in the amount of such expenditures during that period to ensure that such expenditures do not exceed such allowable levels." Further the statute provides as to procedure that before making any adjustment under that authority, "the Secretary shall submit to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry of the Senate and the Committee on Agriculture of the House of Representatives a report describing the determination made under that paragraph and the extent of the adjustment to be made."
176. It should be noted that interpretation of this language should take into account that, as we have noted throughout, the government cannot predict how much actual expenditures for programme crops will be since those expenditures are sensitive to factors outside the control of the government.

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-392
What is clear is that the Congress thought that the problems with total dollar commitments, the AMS, were the only problem likely to arise given that Congress did discipline itself to stay within the support levels of the Peace Clause. The continuation of decoupled payment programmes was anticipated to protect producer income without causing distortions that could increase the level of US world share or could result in price suppression or depression in particular markets. To the contrary, because the Congress anticipated that US prices would still be higher than those elsewhere, the 2002 Act reauthorizes Step 2 payments. There was no contemplation that the mere fact of support, because of the size of the United States, would ipso fact result in a WTO violation, as Brazil would have the Panel make it through its threat of serious prejudice and per se claims. This point is made clear in the conference report on the 2002 Act, in which the Congress says:
The Conference has made it a priority to craft a programme that provides assistance to producers in a way that is consistent with our obligations under the Uruguay Round Agreement on Agriculture.105
177. That said, the circuit breaker provision by its terms applies only to the cited subtitles of the 2002 Farm Bill and as such does not address expenditures under the export credit guarantees programme, crop insurance, or cottonseed programme, provided for elsewhere. Rather, the circuit breaker provision addresses only expenditures under the programme crop programmes that are covered in the cited subtitles ­ namely, the direct and countercyclical payments, the marketing loan payment, and Step 2, for all of the programme addressed in Title I. Those programmes would include, in addition to other crops that are the more traditional "programme crops," payments related to sugar, wool, mohair, and peanuts, and various oilseeds.
(b) Does it relate only to compliance with AMS commitments?
178. By reference to 19 USC 3501, the reference in Section 1601 is to the entirety of the Uruguay Round Agreements, which is identified in 19 USC 3501 and described there. Consequently, the provision would arguably recognize any total limits provided for in that agreement; thus, section 1601(e) applies to the Aggregate Measurement of Support commitments under the Uruguay Round Agreement on Agriculture. To this point, there has been no specific test to determine the precise nature of its limits. Again, however, it must be presumed in light of the history outlined above that the Congress contemplated that if there was to be a problem it would be with the AMS limit. Thus, if there is an AMS problem, the Secretary could limit the expenditures for upland cotton; in that sense, those expenditures are not "without limit."
(c) Is the authority discretionary? If so, can its exercise be limited by the legislative branch of government?
179. The authority is not discretionary, but rather requires that the Secretary take action as the statute provides that "the Secretary shall, to the maximum extent practicable, make adjustments" (emphasis added). In adopting this language, the Senate and House conference members rejected "circuit breaker" provisions proposed in the original House version of the farm bill (HR 2646) and original Senate version (Senate amendment to HR2646) which would have made the adjustment discretionary.106 However, it should be noted that the statute does contain a Congressional referral
105 Report 107-424, page 469 (printed at 148 Cong. Rec.H1916, May 1, 2002). 106 Under the original House version: "[T]he Secretary may make adjustments in the amount of such expenditures during that period to ensure that such expenditures don not exceed, but in no case are less than, such allowable levels" (emphasis added). Under the original Senate version: "Amends Section 161 of the FAIR Act to allow the Secretary to adjust the amount of domestic support to assure compliance with Uruguay Round obligations." See Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002, Conference Report to Accompany HR 2646. House of Representatives, Report 107-424, 1 May 2002, page 468.

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-393
provision, which presumably would allow the Congress to intervene in the event that the Secretary felt it necessary to implement the authority contained in 1601.
(d) How would the Secretary exercise her authority to prevent serious prejudice to the interests of another Member? How would she exercise her authority to prevent a threat of serious prejudice to the interests of another Member? At what time and on the basis of what type of information would she exercise her authority?
180. To the extent mandated by the statute, the Secretary would, subject to the foregoing concerns about the breadth of the statute, adjust the programme provisions to provide for reduced expenditures. But, as indicated, the statute does not appear to contemplate any such finding of serious prejudice, but rather is seemingly focussed more particularly on the overall level of expenditures as that was the only restriction agreed to in this instance by the United States and the United States believes its programme designs to be in compliance with its WTO commitments. The United States continues to maintain its compliance with the AMS levels as agreed to and with all other aspect of its obligations under the agreement, as we have shown. As noted, Congress understood and believed that it was acting within traditional levels and with the allowed levels of the agreement.
(e) What does "to the maximum extent practicable" mean? In what circumstances would it not be practicable for the Secretary to exercise her adjustment authority? USA
181. We believe that this provision of the 2002 Act is directed, in the first instance at least, more at domestic complainants in the event that the correction by the Secretary, because of the difficulties of predicting how much an effect a change could have, could prove more than needed. If so, this could lead, to potential legal claims by US farmers that they had been unduly denied benefits that there were entitled to receive. However, this provision could also contemplate that in some cases the results of an adjustment might well be unknown or that certain programmes or procedures would be too far along in a crop year to allow corrections to be made in any real or fair way, leading to results that otherwise might be objectionable.
254. Would payments made after the date of panel establishment be mandatory under the marketing loan, direct payments, counter-cyclical payments and user marketing certificate (step 2) programmes, but for the circuit-breaker provision? USA
182. Not in the sense at least that there are many conditions that a person must meet in order to qualify for payments, and in the sense that the payments are of course dependent upon the availability of funds from the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC). The CCC has a large, however limited, borrowing authority which must be replenished from time to time. Rarely has CCC run out of funds, but it has happened for brief periods of time -- and of course, Congress can change the programme at any time.
256. The United States submits that the Panel cannot make rulings without allocating precise amounts of payments to upland cotton production. However, to the extent that such precise data is not on the Panel record, to what extent can the Panel rely on less precise data, and on reasonable assumptions, in fulfilling its duty under Article 11 of the DSU in this case? USA
183. Under DSU Article 11, the Panel is called upon to make an objective assessment of the matter before it, which consists of the measures challenged by Brazil and the claims Brazil has advanced. This assessment must include an objective assessment of the facts of the case. It is well-established, however, that a Panel is not to make claims for a party, nor to develop evidence for a party. As the Appellate Body explained in Japan ­ Varietal Testing, it is for the complaining party to bring forward

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-394
sufficient evidence and arguments to carry its burden of establishing a prima facie case. Thus, although a panel may be able to draw reasonable inferences from evidence on the record as part of its objective assessment of the facts of the case, such inferences cannot take the place of evidence necessary for a complaining party to establish its prima facie case.
184. The difficulty in this dispute arises because Brazil has chosen to challenge decoupled income support measures ­ namely, direct payments and counter-cyclical payments ­ that are not tied to production or sale of upland cotton. For payments that are tied to production of upland cotton ­ for example, marketing loan payments ­ there is no difficulty because the subsidy is solely attributed to upland cotton.107 As set out in previous US submissions and oral statements, however, decoupled payments must be allocated across the value of each recipient's production in order to determine what is the benefit to upland cotton within the meaning of Article 1 of the Subsidies Agreement. A failure to allocate the decoupled payment either would result in arbitrarily assigning subsidy benefits to one product over another or would result in double-counting of a subsidy as providing a greater benefit than the value of the payment.
185. Brazil has not identified evidence that would allow for the challenged decoupled payments to be allocated across their recipients' production (that is, attributed to upland cotton and any other commodities produced by those recipients). Thus, Brazil has not established facts necessary for the Panel to identify the amount of the challenged subsidy nor evaluate its effects. Even if there were evidence on the record from which "reasonable assumptions" (in the words of the question) could be drawn, the Panel could not make those assumptions because Brazil has not claimed that allocating the value of these decoupled payments across the total value of each recipient's production is necessary. That is, while Brazil has improperly sought to expand the scope of this dispute by allocating decoupled payments received for non-upland cotton base acres to upland cotton producers, Brazil has not claimed that all such payments must be allocated across the value of the recipient's production. To the contrary, Brazil has argued that such payments would exclusively be support to upland cotton.108
186. As a result, this dispute presents a situation analogous to that in the Japan ­ Varietals dispute. Were the Panel to agree that to determine the subsidy benefit to upland cotton decoupled payments not tied to upland cotton production must be allocated across the total value of the recipient's production, the Panel could not then seek evidence or make "reasonable assumptions" relating to such an allocation because to do so would be to make a claim that Brazil has not advanced. Brazil has chosen solely to argue that decoupled payments for base acreage up to the amount of upland cotton planted on the farm are support to upland cotton, ignoring the production of any other crops on the

108 See Brazil's Further Rebuttal Submission, para. 24 ("This EWG data also provides the amount of upland cotton contract payments attributable to upland cotton producers, broken down by PFC, market loss assistance, direct and counter-cyclical payments. These figures are also set out in the table above. However, because some upland cotton was produced on non-upland cotton contract base, it would be necessary to calculate an amount of non-upland cotton contract payments, based on the EWG data, that also constitutes support to upland cotton received by producers of upland cotton.").

farm. (For example, with respect to plantings and not production, the data provided to the Panel and Brazil on December 18 and 19, 2003, demonstrate that, in the aggregate for farms planting upland cotton in marketing year 2002, upland cotton planted acres represented only 48 per cent of total cropland on those farms. One could surmise that Brazil refuses to recognize that decoupled payments must be allocated because to do so would invalidate both Brazil's Peace Clause analysis, which merely took the value of decoupled payments for upland cotton base acres and factored such payments by approximately 14/16, and Brazil's serious prejudice analysis by eliminating a substantial portion of the "$12.9 billion" in payments alleged to have been made to upland cotton. Nonetheless, Brazil has chosen what arguments and evidence to advance to support its claims ­ as is its prerogative. The Panel must judge whether those arguments and evidence amount to a prima facie case. Where Brazil has refused to adopt the proper approach to allocation of decoupled payments and has identified no evidence to allow a proper allocation, the Panel may not step into the breach and make any "reasonable assumptions" to support Brazil' s claims.

ANNEX I-9
COMMENTS OF THE UNITED STATES CONCERNING BRAZIL'S ECONOMETRIC MODEL
22 December 2003
I. THE SUMNER MODEL PRESENTED BY BRAZIL DOES NOT PROVIDE ACCEPTABLE ECONOMIC SUPPORT FOR BRAZIL'S CLAIM OF SERIOUS PREJUDICE
A. INTRODUCTION
1. Our review of Brazil's economic model analysis as submitted by Brazil and independently by Dr. Bruce Babcock of Iowa State University shows a clear and consistent manipulation of well-known econometric tools and mischaracterization of the US cotton programme in order to exaggerate acreage and ultimate price impacts. In particular:
· The Sumner approach forces changes onto the FAPRI system, and misleadingly claims the result as a FAPRI-type analysis;
· Using flawed and often unsubstantiated economic assumptions, Brazil transformed the FAPRI model for its own purposes;
· Every economic result ascribed to a FAPRI-type analysis by Brazil contains the same flawed assumptions originally introduced by Dr. Sumner;
· Brazil did not use the correct models or assumptions according to FAPRI/CARD analysts and appears to have even changed the underlying FAPRI baseline in order to exaggerate acreage and price impacts of programme removal.
2. This critique is directed primarily at Dr. Sumner's model, the results of which were first presented to the Panel in Annex I.1 Brazil continues to cite Annex I as a part of its fundamental economic findings. The United States notes that Brazil has introduced different analytical tools since the United States and the Panel requested to see the model used to produce the Annex I results.2 In no instance has Brazil appeared to retreat from its impacts cited in Annex I.
3. Dr. Sumner's supply-side adaptations or modifications to the FAPRI model with respect to various components of the US cotton programme, such as direct payments or export credit guarantees, continue to be the key reason his model displayed the results presented in Annex I and are carried
1 In evaluating Dr. Sumner's impacts (and this critique of them), the Panel should take into consideration that Annex I results have not been, and apparently cannot be, confirmed. The models used and outputs obtained were, by their own admission, not retained by Dr. Sumner nor Dr. Babcock. See, Letter dated 31 October 2003 from Dr. Bruce Babcock to Dr. Dan Sumner, submitted to Panel by Brazil on 5 November 2003. The record remains incomplete with respect to Dr. Sumner's adaptations. The United States has attempted in this critique to note where it has been forced to make assumptions due to missing data.
2 The United States has based its critique on three Excel spreadsheets that have been provided by Brazil and/or Dr. Bruce Babcock. These include the CARD international cotton model, delivered by Brazil on 13 November, the cotton-only US model provided by Brazil on 18 November; and the US crops model provided by Dr. Babcock on November 26. A graphical representation of the scope and disclosure of Brazil's modelling system is provided in Exhibit US-113.

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-397
forward into all subsequent econometric demonstrations using subsequent FAPRI baselines. In many respects, Brazil's Annex I (and subsequent) results are caused directly by introduced changes to the FAPRI model.
4. Brazil offers Dr. Sumner's model results as evidence that but for the US cotton programme, US cotton acreage would have declined and world prices would have increased. While the US has in its submissions and oral statements demonstrated the fatal flaws in Brazil's arguments on subsidy identification, causation, and its actionable subsidies claims, it is clear to the United States that but for the significant manipulation and adaptation of the FAPRI model carried out by Brazil and Dr. Sumner, acreage impacts attributed to the US cotton programme by that economic model would be far less than reported in Annex I. As a result, Dr. Sumner's economic analysis cannot serve as a basis for any findings on the effect of challenged US subsidies.
II. BRAZIL MODEL IS NOT FAPRI/CARD ANALYSIS
5. The adaptations and modifications made to the FAPRI model by Brazil have so changed the model that Brazil cannot rely on FAPRI's reputation to confirm the results.
· Dr. Babcock, Dr. Sumner's "collaborator" on the project, states that a FAPRI analysis would have used different models and applied different assumptions;
· Thus, Dr. Babcock has stated that the Sumner analysis is "in no way" an official FAPRI analysis.
6. In a recent letter, Dr. Babcock, an economist at the CARD located at Iowa State University and the "technician" that carried out much of Dr. Sumner's economic analysis3, cleared up some of the confusion regarding the models used in Brazil's analysis. In Dr. Babcock's opinion, a true FAPRI analysis would have used different models and applied different assumptions to those models to arrive at the type of estimate presented by Brazil in its Annex I. In his letter Dr. Babcock states that the analysis carried out by Dr. Sumner and used by Brazil was
"in no way an official FAPRI analysis and if FAPRI had done the analysis, FAPRI would have come up with different estimates of the effects of US cotton subsidies on world prices."4
7. Dr. Babcock also stresses the differences between FAPRI and Dr. Sumner's assumptions used to estimate the effects of various components of US cotton policy. Many of these different assumptions are described in Bra-313 and will be discussed in detail.
8. Dr. Babcock indicates a FAPRI analysis would have used different models. He states that FAPRI would have used different models entirely.
"The domestic model used was not based on the models used for the FAPRI 2003 baseline. ... the model that FAPRI uses to conduct domestic and international US policy analysis is the US stochastic model and the FAPRI international models. The
3 Opening Statement of Dr. Sumner, 2 Dec. 2003, "I have specified equations and parameters which adapt the systems to apply to the specific questions of interest in this dispute and I have worked closely with skilled and experienced technicians who have operated the details of the system. This is the same procedure that economists routinely use in performing simulation modelling in academic research and that they use in performing complex econometric statistical analysis. I rely on the technician to operate the "machinery" of the models just as a medical doctor would rely on an X-ray or Magnetic Resonance Imaging technician to operate those systems and generate results for analysis and interpretation."

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-398
international cotton model used in Dan's analysis was a stand-alone cotton model developed to better understand the role that China plays in international cotton markets."
"... FAPRI would have used different models ..."5
9. Dr. Babcock's letter confirms that the concerns of the United States have been well-founded. While cloaking itself in the FAPRI model's reputation, Brazil and Dr. Sumner's analysis is, in fact, something quite different. The differences between FAPRI and the Brazil analysis reflected in Annex I involve much more than small, "conservative" changes. As the United States will demonstrate, Brazil's Annex I analysis relies too heavily on adaptations, modifications and adjustments to suggest acceptance based upon FAPRI's reputation. Brazil's estimates, to a very great extent, distort the FAPRI system for the express purpose of achieving pre-conceived results.
10. The United States, after completing as complete a critique of Annex I results as possible in this proceeding, respectfully submits that the results indicated in Annex I are significantly exaggerated, due either to economic errors or to Dr. Sumner's introduced biases (most of which are discussed in Bra-313 and in Annex I, and many of which contain errors). Brazil's results set out in Annex I and subsequent submissions have no explanatory power.
11. The United States submits that the results in Annex I provide very little guidance to the Panel in terms of overall impacts of the US cotton programme. The United States has stated that the FAPRI model as used by Dr. Sumner was an inappropriate tool for the intended job. This opinion has now been confirmed by Dr. Sumner's chief "technician" on this project6, who has directly stated that FAPRI would not have used the models used by Dr. Sumner and would not have made the adaptations to that model that he discusses in Annex I and in Bra 313 if it had been requested as an organization to conduct this analysis.
A. BRAZIL MODEL NOT COMPARABLE TO FAPRI SYSTEM
12. The differences between Dr. Sumner's analysis and the FAPRI framework are significant. Those differences arise primarily as a result of Brazil's disagreement with FAPRI and many other agricultural economists over the impact of payment programmes that are not directly linked to production decisions. There are other important differences. Most notably, FAPRI does not include crop insurance as a production-distorting programme. The FAPRI model also does not contain components designed to estimate production effects from the export credit guarantee programme, a seemingly appropriate choice since Brazil itself has stated that it cannot quantify the alleged benefit to upland cotton provided by the export credit guarantee programmes.7
13. Whenever the FAPRI modeling system did not tend to show acreage impacts high enough to satisfy Brazil in this case, Dr. Sumner simply made modifications to encourage it to do so. The United States disagrees with these modifications, but still cannot confirm all of these changes or the specific components of each of them. Second, whenever the FAPRI modeling system did not include a programme component challenged by Brazil, Dr. Sumner simply forced acreage impacts of that programme onto the system - showing little or no economic foundation for the introduced variables.8
5 Id. 6 "...FAPRI would have used different models". Letter from Dr. Babcock, Exhibit US-114. 7 Paragraph 82 of Answers of Brazil to Questions from the Panel, 27 October 2003. 8 For example, Brazil cites export impacts ascribed to the export credit guarantee programme by the National Cotton Council of America and uses those impacts without further foundation. The National Cotton Council of America's economic analysis in this instance has no foundation and no demonstrated methodology.

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-399
14. All of these effects, displayed in Annex I, were introduced into the FAPRI system by Dr. Sumner. Dr. Sumner discusses some of his modifications in Bra-313, but not all of them. Dr. Sumner has never provided the United States with an electronic, verifiable version of his modifications. Efforts by the United States to replicate the Sumner formula using a FAPRI model have been unsuccessful, leading to the conclusion that other modifications, adaptations or calibrations are involved.
B. ADAPTATIONS TO AND MODIFICATIONS OF FAPRI MODEL RESULTED IN EXAGGERATED RESULTS
15. Dr. Sumner's treatment of decoupled payments, crop insurance, and export credits are significant deviations from the FAPRI modelling framework. These changes are forced onto the FAPRI system resulting acreage effects that are much greater than would ever be anticipated by a true FAPRI analysis. Again, as Dr. Babcock has now candidly stated:
"In addition, the modeling assumptions that Dan used to estimate the effects of the various US domestic programme components of US policy are different than FAPRI would use if asked to answer the same questions."9
1. Dr. Sumner exaggerates the impact of decoupled payments as compared to FAPRI's modelling of those payments
16. FAPRI analysis of the impacts of decoupled programmes (like Production Flexibility Contract payments (PFC), Direct Payments (DP), Market Loss Assistance payments (MLA) and Countercyclical Payments (CCP) was discarded by Dr. Sumner and replaced with an approach not supported by FAPRI, nor supported by the bulk of economic literature on the subject.
17. Dr. Sumner's decoupled effects are different than those normally used by FAPRI and were supposedly justified by Dr. Sumner's own estimation of producers' "anticipation" of future programme changes and on his, now proven incorrect, contrived assumptions about actual planting patterns in the United States.10
18. The FAPRI baseline reflects their "most-likely" outcome for acreage, production, consumption and prices under a defined set of assumptions. Acreage projections for each of the crops reflect assumptions and outcomes for market indicators and government policy. According to the US crops model (Excel file US CROPS MODEL 2002.xls) sent by Dr. Babcock on 26 November, upland cotton acreage in each region is determined by the following equation:
CTPLTi = ao + ao*CTENRi/PD + A*(Vector of Competing Crop Returnsi)/PD + Decoupled Payment Impactsi + CRP11 Impactsi + i
where CTPLT = upland cotton planted acreage in region i CTENR = expected cotton net returns from the market and the marketing loan in region i PD = general price deflator A = vector of parameter estimates for competing crops.
9 For example, Brazil cites export impacts ascribed to the export credit guarantee programme by the National Cotton Council of America and uses those impacts without further foundation. The National Cotton Council of America's economic analysis in this instance has no foundation and no demonstrated methodology.

11 CRP = Conservation Reserve Programme.

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-400
19. Although the US does not agree that decoupled payments impact planting decisions, it is useful to compare FAPRI's view of the impacts with that of Dr. Sumner.
20. Looking further into the FAPRI model, one finds that the decoupled payments are not included on a crop-specific basis as done by Dr. Sumner in his adaptations. Instead, FAPRI allocates total decoupled payments across all crops in a region. First, the total money is put on a per-acre basis by dividing the payments by acres planted to the major crops. Second, FAPRI then determines a total acreage impact for the region based on the responsiveness of the total land to the infusion of money. Third, the total acreage impact is allocated to the individual crops in each region based on the crop's share of recent plantings.
· Dr. Sumner discarded this FAPRI approach to decoupled payments and inserted his own "coupling" factor.
· Cotton acreage impacts for US decoupled programmes as would likely be presented by FAPRI are about 0.3%, consistent with the estimates in the economic literature previously presented by the United States (e.g., Westcott et al.).12
· Dr. Sumner's cotton acreage impacts, by contrast, are as high as 15.9% - that is, more than 50 times larger than what the FAPRI model would indicate.
21. The following table provides a comparison of acreage impacts included in the FAPRI model to those calculated by Dr. Sumner. In the FAPRI model, the acreage contribution of all decoupled payments across all major programme crops ranges between 1.4 and 2.6 million acres. Decoupled payments to all crops contribute between 69 and 123 thousand acres to upland cotton. If we isolate the impact of decoupled payments for upland cotton base acres, the FAPRI model indicates that the shift in total cotton plantings ranges between 23 and 45 thousand acres, or less than three-tenths of one percent of upland cotton area. Impacts of this magnitude would not have appreciable impact on production and prices.
22. In stark contrast to the FAPRI model are the contrived impacts calculated by Dr. Sumner. In order to present a complete picture to the Panel, the United States presents Dr. Sumner's impacts in two ways. In Dr. Sumner's analysis of decoupled payments, equations (5) and (6) of Exhibit Bra-313 document his formulas for determining "the amount of cotton acreage that was held in cotton by these programme payments". This acreage is subtracted from the error term of the equation or the impact can also be thought of as a shift in the supply curve. This impact will be termed the "gross impact" on cotton acreage of the programme in question. Values for these "gross impacts" have been taken from the file FINAL US2003CropsModel WORKOUT.xls (received by the United States on 18 November). Dr. Sumner's "gross impacts" of cotton decoupled payments on cotton plantings range from a low of 352 thousand acres to a high of 2.2 million acres. In contrast, the FAPRI model shows a gross impact of 23 to 45 thousand acres. Dr. Sumner's impacts are almost 50 times larger than those included in the FAPRI model.
23. To avoid any confusion by the Panel, the gross impacts of the programmes are not the same values as the impacts shown in Annex I and Exhibit Bra-325. The results of Dr. Sumner's scenarios reflect his estimate of the net impact of removing various aspects of the cotton programme. Net impacts will reflect the fact that producers have responded to the higher cotton prices under the scenario and increased plantings to partially offset the initial loss in acreage.
24. The following table also provides a comparison of Dr. Sumner's net acreage impacts of removing decoupled payments. These impacts correspond to the results presented in Annex I. It is
12 Westcott, P., Young, C. E., and Price, M., USDA, ERS, The 2002 Farm Act, Provisions and Implications for Commodity markets, Economic Research Service, November 2002. (See Exhibit Bra-42)

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-401

worthwhile to note that Dr. Sumner's net impacts are still 25 times larger than the gross impacts derived from the FAPRI model. Simply put, FAPRI's model would not show the kind of acreage impacts assumed by Dr. Sumner.

2. Dr. Sumner Assigns Production Effects to Crop Insurance that FAPRI Does Not

25. Dr. Sumner's arbitrary introduction of crop insurance into his acreage system is a direct departure from the FAPRI model. Dr. Sumner provides no statistical basis to support his incorporation of crop insurance. He simply derives a per-acre value, forces those impacts into the acreage system, and treats the results as valid analysis. There is absolutely no empirical validation associated with his results.

26. FAPRI does not explicitly attribute any acreage response to the availability of crop insurance. Dr. Sumner's gross impacts range as high as 1.05 million acres, and net impacts reach 590 thousand acres.

27. The exclusion of crop insurance from the FAPRI model is warranted. As the United States has previously suggested13, if one were to consider the coverage levels obtained by cotton farmers,
over 90 per cent of insured cotton area would be subject to coverage levels agreed by Members to
have no or minimal trade-distorting effects.

28. The United States has also demonstrated that the economic literature examining acreage
effects of crop insurance is clearly mixed, but have never gone so far as to attribute production impacts as great as those asserted by Brazil.14 The literature in general reflects that by its very nature
the impact of crop insurance on production may be significantly different than its impact on acreage.

29. It seems intuitive to the United States that a dollar provided in the way of an insurance premium subsidy (provided to reduce the cost of an insurance product that pays when the crop is not produced) would have different impacts on producer decisions than a dollar provided to the producer when the value of a harvested crop falls short of some defined level (such as a marketing loan payment). Dr. Sumner's analysis treats them the same. FAPRI does not.

30. Thus, it is significant that the FAPRI model does not attribute acreage response to the availability of crop insurance. Dr. Sumner deviates from that model without any empirical foundation in the economic literature.

3. Dr. Sumner Assigns a Production Effect to Export Credits that FAPRI Does Not
31. In a further departure from the modelling approach used by FAPRI, Dr. Sumner introduces a 500 thousand-bale impact for export credit programmes. US exports are reduced by introducing this shift in the US export equation.15 The resulting effect is to lower the US price while increasing the world price. However, as with Dr. Sumner's other modifications, there is no statistical basis for these changes.
32. Brazil provides no statistical or other economic foundation for this level of impact from the export credit guarantee programme. Dr. Sumner's stated source for the 500,000 bale impact is testimony delivered by the National Cotton Council of America in 2001, a US trade association that operates on behalf of the US cotton industry.16 Brazil presents no evidence of how that estimate was calculated and presents no analysis of its own.17
33. With respect to any actual effects on world prices caused by the application of the US export credit guarantee programme to US cotton exports, Brazil has cited no subsidy component estimates and demonstrated no economic analysis.
34. Dr. Sumner's model passes off his 500,000-bale export shift as economic analysis and forces it upon the FAPRI model. Does the Sumner model show acreage impacts from the removal of the export credit guarantee programme? Of course it does since Dr. Sumner forced it to show those impacts. Brazil, cannot, however, base its estimates on FAPRI or on any demonstrated analytical approach.
15 Exhibit Bra-313, page 5, "For the export credit, as explained in the Annex I, I base the estimated shift in export demand conservatively on the information provided by the US Cotton Council. The FAPRI baseline, which assumes continuation of the export credit programme, implicitly includes 500,000 bales of cotton attributable to the export credit programme. So eliminating the programme is implemented by simply subtracting 500,000 bales from the intercept of equation 7 in each year."
16 See Exhibit Bra-41. The National Cotton Council is a trade association that lobbies the US government on behalf of the US cotton industry.
17 In the 9 September Brazil Submission before the Second Session of the First Panel Meeting, paras 192-194, Brazil carried out another economic sleight of hand by implying that Dr. Sumner's export estimates with respect to the export credit guarantee program were more conservative than the unsubstantiated estimate it cites from the National Cotton Council. Paragraph 194 of that submission acts as if the NCC estimate of a possible 3 cent per pound US price impact and Dr. Sumner's estimate of a .57 cent per pound world price impact are somehow independent analyses - and demonstrate Dr. Sumner's conservative approach. However, as demonstrated in Bra-313, all Dr. Sumner did was force a reduction in US export estimates of 500,000 bales (using the NCC testimony as his sole economic foundation), which correspondingly reduced prices in the US, which correspondingly both reduced US acreage and slightly increased exports - cutting into the initially imposed 500,000 bale shift. Further, the "different" price estimates were, in fact, estimates of two different set of prices - US and world. Brazil inappropriately characterized Dr. Sumner's results as being conservative relative to the NCC estimate. (Paragraph 192, Brazil's Further Submission to the Panel, 9 September 2003) Later when the Panel raised a question about the results, Dr. Sumner somehow forced a full 500,000 bale decline in US exports, ignoring the impacts of price response. (See, for example, Bra-325, last category of tables - export credit guarantee with fixed 500,000 bale impact) In that response, Brazil also maintained the stance that these two "analyses," neither demonstrating economic foundation, were somehow independent, while fairly clearly demonstrating that Dr. Sumner merely took the NCC testimony and imposed a 500,000 bale demand shift.

III. ANNEX I RESULTS USED VARIABLES LOWER THAN CITED NOVEMBER 2002 FAPRI BASELINE
35. The United States has previously indicated to the Panel its concern that acreage impacts in Annex I were based off of the FAPRI preliminary November '02 baseline instead of the more recent and readily available final January 2003 FAPRI baseline. The United States believes this choice of baseline biased the results shown in Annex I.18 A closer review of the Annex I results, however, show they were not exactly based off the November 2002 baseline either.
A. USE OF VARIABLES LOWER THAN NOVEMBER 2002 BASELINE INCREASED ACREAGE IMPACTS
· By using prices and other variables that were even lower than the FAPRI November '02 baseline, Brazil managed to further increase acreage impacts it attributed to the US cotton programme.
36. Contrary to the assertions contained in Annex I, it appears that the baseline that is presented there is not the FAPRI November 2002 baseline. The following table provides a comparison of the "A" Index from the baseline presented in Annex I with the FAPRI November 2002 baseline as provided by Dr. Babcock on 26 November.

37. The baseline used by the Annex I model appears to contain slightly lower cotton planted acreage, different upland cotton production, lower upland cotton farm prices and lower "A" index cotton prices than were shown in the FAPRI preliminary November 2002 baseline.19
B. BASELINE USED IN ANNEX I EXAGGERATED PROGRAMME EFFECTS BEYOND THAT PREVIOUSLY ASSUMED BY UNITED STATES
38. The baseline used in Annex I exaggerated programme effects even more than previously assumed by the United States. The baseline used in Annex I contained lower cotton prices than those included in the FAPRI November 2002 baseline. It also contains several other variables that are different from the November 2002 baseline. There is no basis for this discrepancy, if Dr. Sumner actually used the November 2002 FAPRI baseline and, as stated in Bra-313, "none of the other equations in the FAPRI specification are modified to explicitly analyze the removal of US cotton programmes".20
IV. BRAZIL'S MODEL HAS NO EXPLANATORY POWER
39. It would be anticipated that a model proposed to demonstrate effects of removing programme components of the US cotton programme and the impact of that removal on planting decisions would also demonstrate the ability to correctly predict planted acreage of upland cotton, given prices and other factors.
40. The Sumner-modified model presented in Annex I does not explain cotton planting decisions.

19 Brazil's later submissions refer to the November 2002 baseline, paragraph 114 of Brazil's Further
Rebuttal Submission of 18 Nov 2003. 20 Bra-313, page 5.

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-406
41. In fact, the simple ratio of cotton to soybeans expected harvest season futures prices at the time of planting, discussed by the United States21, does a much better job of explaining the movement in US cotton acreage than what is found in Dr. Sumner's formulation.
42. Even an analysis of planting decisions based on lagged prices, while not as correlated as the ratio of expected futures prices, also does a better job of explaining producer planting decisions than does Dr. Sumner's net returns formulation.
43. In fact, the formulation presented in Annex I actually contains a negative correlation between expected net revenue and planting decisions in most cotton regions of the United States.
44. In other words, the Annex I model tends to predict that cotton producers will plant less cotton in response to higher returns.
45. In Annex I, Dr. Sumner reports the functional form of expected net revenue used in determining planted acreage of upland cotton (equation 1 on page 13). Empirical results indicate that Dr. Sumner's contrived formulation of expected net revenue does not explain the movement in US plantings of upland cotton.22 The following table presents correlation coefficients between the explanatory variables in Dr. Sumner's acreage equations and actual acreage levels for each region and for the United States over the 1996-2002 period.
46. Cotton expected net revenue, in nominal terms, calculated according to equation (1) of Annex I has a negative correlation with planted acreage in 4 of the 6 cotton-producing regions modelled by Dr. Sumner. Over the 1996-2002 period, those 4 regions accounted for 93% of US acreage. Dr. Sumner's equations for planted acreage are not solely based on nominal net revenue of cotton. They also take into account competing crops in each region, and returns are converted to real dollars by dividing by a general price deflator.
47. The lack of predictive ability of Dr. Sumner's acreage equations is best illustrated by the correlation between acreage and the Weighted Expected Net Returns for all Crops in real terms. This aggregate net return is calculated by multiplying each parameter estimate by the respective real net returns for that crop calculated according to equation (1) of Annex I and then summing the resulting values. This calculation incorporates all explanatory variables that are included in Dr. Sumner's acreage equations with the appropriate elasticity.
48. The correlation results indicate that Dr. Sumner's equations are not accurate predictors of the movements in cotton acreage. The correlation in 3 regions is negative, and in two other regions, the correlation is weakly positive. Only in the smallest production region in the US is there a positive correlation that is statistically significant.
21 Paragraphs 152-167 of US Further Rebuttal Submission, 18 November 2003. 22 The calculation of expected net revenue follows the general form indicated by equation (1) of Annex I. Data for expected market and marketing loan benefits are taken directly from the file FINAL US2003CropsModel WORKOUT.xls, which is a cotton-only US model supplied by Brazil. Exact calculations of per-acre PFC, DP, MLA and CCP payments, as well as crop insurance were not included in the file. Nor has this exact documentation been provided by Brazil. In the absence of a complete explanation regarding these calculations, the US has adopted the following formulas for expected per-acre payments for each region i:
PFCi = 0.85 * (PFC Payment Rate) * (Programme Yield)i, MLAi = 0.85 * (MLA Payment Rate) * (Programme Yield)i, DPi = 0.85 * (Direct Payment Rate) * (Programme Yield)i, CCPi = 0.85 * max(0, Target Price ­ max)(Loan Rate, Farm Price)) (Programme Yield)I, The variables for decoupled payments and crop insurance have been calculated for each crop and region and included in expected net revenue for the determination of correlation coefficients and explanatory power.

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-407

49. In fact, the explanatory power and reliability of Dr. Sumner's acreage model is far less than one explanation of recent movements in cotton acreage provided by the United States, the ratio of cotton to soybeans expected harvest season futures prices at time of planting. Because soybeans is a major competing crop of cotton in many cotton-producing regions, this ratio expresses the relative attractiveness of planting cotton from expected market returns.23 Simply put, the ratio of expected futures prices does a much better job of explaining the movement in US cotton acreage than what is found in Dr. Sumner's arbitrary formulation.

50. The statistics are very clear. Dr. Sumner's methodology of modelling producer expectations and planting decisions has no explanatory power, and analysis based on these equations is not reliable. His proposed formulation of net returns is not consistent with producers' expectations and acreage decisions. The equations are not reliable for assessing the removal of US programmes, and this applies to not only decoupled payments and crop insurance, but also marketing loans.
51. Recent historical data clearly indicate that producers are making their decisions on their expectations of market prices for cotton and primary competing crops.24 Furthermore, those price expectations are not captured by the naïve approach of simply using last year's price to determine this year's acreage decision. As Brazil's expert, Mr. MacDonald explained at the second session of the first panel meeting, futures markets embody the best available information about expected prices. The data indicate that cotton farmers' planting decisions are made accordingly.

52. The formulations discussed in Annex I do not reflect the expectations of producers and do not explain the movement in US cotton acreage. This is particularly troublesome as those formulations are a critical link in Brazil's attempt to ascribe significant acreage impacts to the US cotton programme. There is no credible statistical evidence that supports this linkage, and the Annex I formulations that form a part of this analytical linkage fail to accurately explain movement in acreage.
V. DR. SUMNER'S METHODOLOGY DEVIATES FROM FAPRI'S LINEAR ACREAGE SYSTEM
53. FAPRI's linear acreage system would tend to ensure that impacts from a static change in returns should be the same across several years. However, contrary to the normal FAPRI system, the Sumner analysis shows impacts that grow substantially over several years.
54. According to the US crops model (Excel file US CROPS MODEL 2002.xls) sent by Dr. Babcock on 26 November, upland cotton acreage in each region is determined by the following equation:
CTPLTi = ao + ao*CTENRi/PD + A*(Vector of Competing Crop Returnsi)/PD + Decoupled Payment Impactsi + CRP Impactsi + i
where CTPLT = upland cotton planted acreage in region i CTENR = expected cotton net returns from the market and the marketing loan in region i PD = general price deflator A = vector of parameter estimates for competing crops.
Expected net returns for each crop are defined as (Lagged Farm Price + max(0, Loan Rate ­ Lagged Loan Repayment Price)) * Expected Yield ­ Variable Costs.
55. As documented in equation (1) of Annex I, Dr. Sumner modifies expected net returns to include his calculations of decoupled payments and crop insurance benefits. The new equations for expected net returns are transformed as follows:
(Lagged Farm Price + max(0, Loan Rate ­ Lagged Loan Repayment Price)) * Expected Yield ­ Variable Costs + bpfc * PFC + bdp * DP + bmla * MLA + bccp * CCP + CIS, where
PFC = per-acre PFC payments DP = per-acre direct payments MLA = per-acre MLA payments CCP = per-acre counter-cyclical payments CIS = crop insurance variable bpfc , bdp , bmla , bccp = scaling factors.
56. An important aspect of the linear acreage equations as modified by Dr. Sumner concerns the response to changes in net returns. If net returns for cotton change by a given amount, then the impact or shift in cotton acreage is determined as ai*(Change in returns)/PD. If the change in returns is the same across years, then the only difference in terms of the acreage impact is due to the value of the price deflator PD.
A. ACREAGE IMPACTS FOR 2003-07 APPEAR INCONSISTENT WITH 1999-2002 PERIOD
57. Dr. Sumner's acreage impacts attributed to decoupled payments and crop insurance show tremendous variations over the 1999-2007 period. Specifically, acreage shifts for the 2003-07 period are much larger than those reported for the 1999-02 period. The larger impacts are not consistent with

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-409
the relative programme values assumed by Dr. Sumner. In the case of decoupled payments, incorporating Dr. Sumner's "coupling" factors does not fully explain the differences in impacts.
58. The following table provides a comparison of the average acreage impacts reported in rows 720-771 of the file FINAL US2003CropsModel WORKOUT.xls. The averages reflect the two periods of the analysis covered by the different farm bills. The US cannot verify Dr. Sumner's calculations due to insufficient information. However, some basic calculations cast serious doubt on the validity of Dr. Sumner's analysis.
59. The acreage impacts reported for DP payments over the 2003-07 period are much larger than those indicated for PFC payments during 1999-2002 even though direct payment rates under the current farm bill are actually smaller than PFC payment rates under the FAIR Act. Surprisingly, this difference cannot be adequately explained by Dr. Sumner's decision to provide much stronger acreage impacts for Direct Payments than he attributed to PFC payments. Even when the United States attempted to incorporate Dr. Sumner's "coupling" factor, the acreage impacts appear much larger than the increased (1.5 times) "coupling" factor would seem to indicate.
60. The same concern holds true for MLA and CCP payments. The acreage impact associated with CCP increases by a factor of five while the effective payment under the 2002 Act is 3.4 times larger than the MLA payment. In the Central Plains, the impact is more than 147 times larger over the 03-07 period than over 99-02. The Southeast shows an acreage impact due to CCP that is almost 8 times the size of that implied for MLA by Dr. Sumner under the 1996 Act.
B. CROP INSURANCE IMPACTS OVER 2003-2007 PERIOD VARY FROM IMPACTS OVER 19992002
61. In paragraphs 52 through 56 of Annex I, Dr. Sumner addresses his contrived methodology for incorporating crop insurance. He states that the per-acre crop insurance effect on net revenue is the same in all years of the analysis, and at the national level, it equals $19 per acre. He does not indicate if the value changes for each region in his acreage system. That notwithstanding, we do know that the impact on net revenue is the same in all years of the analysis. If that is the case, then the linear specification presented in equation (1) of Annex I would generate roughly the same acreage shift in each year of the analysis, with the exception of the impact of the change in the general price deflator. Since the price deflator, which is a measure of general price inflation, generally increases over time, then the actual impact on acreage should get modestly smaller over time. Instead, Dr. Sumner's acreage shifts due to crop insurance increase dramatically over the analysis period. In the early years, the impact of $19 in net revenue amounts to fewer than 600 thousand acres, while it grows to more than 1 million acres in 2003.
62. Despite the fact that the perceived benefit did not change, Dr. Sumner's methodology produced an acreage impact over the 2003-07 period that is roughly 1.5 times larger than over the 1999-2002 period. Furthermore, in the case of the Corn Belt, Dr. Sumner's analysis actually indicates that the presence of the crop insurance programme has removed acres from cotton production - a result that is implausible.

C. SUMNER MODEL ADOPTS NON-LINEAR RESPONSES CONTRARY TO FAPRI
63. In Exhibit Bra-313, Dr. Sumner provides further documentation regarding the analysis of decoupled payments and crop insurance. The new documentation suggests an entirely different methodology than presented in Annex I.

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-411
64. The documentation provided in Annex I suggests that cotton area is determined by the equation:
CTPLTi = ao + ao*CTENRi/PD + A*(Vector of Competing Crop Returnsi)/PD + i
where cotton expected net returns CTENR are determined as (Lagged Farm Price + max(0, Loan Rate ­ Lagged Loan Repayment Price)) * Expected Yield ­ Variable Costs + bpfc * PFC + bdp * DP + bmla * MLA + bccp * CCP + CIS.
65. Based on this documentation, analyzing the impacts of no decoupled payments would be done by simply setting the decoupled payments to zero. However, in Exhibit Bra-313, equations (4)-(6) suggest a very different methodology for deriving impacts. Dr. Sumner reports to use the following approach:
Percentage difference in acreage due to programme = (Expected programme payments/(Expected programme payments + (cotton market & market loan net revenue))) * Acreage elasticity.
Acreage impacts would be derived by multiplying the percentage difference in acreage by the baseline level of acreage.
66. The new methodology yields acreage impacts that vary depending on the level of returns from the market and marketing loan. This methodology explains how Dr. Sumner is able to derive varying impacts in a scenario where the change introduced into the system is constant, such as the crop insurance scenario.
D. SUMNER FORMULATION IGNORES PRESENCE OF OTHER PROGRAMMES AND THEREFORE EXAGGERATES IMPACTS
67. Dr. Sumner's formulation for isolating the impacts of each individual programme produces exaggerated results. It is logical to assume that Dr. Sumner's baseline acreage represents his most likely view based on the presence of all US cotton programmes. As such, determining the acreage impact of each individual programme should be done by comparing returns from the programme in question with total returns, where total returns are defined as
(Lagged Farm Price + max(0, Loan Rate ­ Lagged Loan Repayment Price)) * Expected Yield ­ Variable Costs + bpfc * PFC + bdp * DP + bmla * MLA + bccp * CCP + CIS.
68. Dr. Sumner's approach of comparing returns for the programme in question to returns from the market and marketing loan ignores the presence of other programmes. Since returns from the market and marketing loan are less than total returns, then the acreage impacts for a given programme based on Dr. Sumner's formulation will be larger. The following table uses data for the Southern Plains in 2005 to illustrate the differences. Following Dr. Sumner's documentation of Exhibit Bra313, the acreage impacts of decoupled payments and crop insurance total 671 thousand acres. If the methodology was based on total revenue, then the estimated acreage impact is 543 thousand acres. Full details of the calculations are presented in the file FINAL US2003CropsModel Correl 1 (Exhibit US-115).
E. UNITED STATES HAS DIFFICULTY REPLICATING SUMNER RESULTS - EVEN AFTER ADOPTING SUMNER METHODOLOGY
69. The estimates prepared by the US are substantially smaller than those reported by Dr. Sumner in the file FINAL US2003CropsModel WORKOUT.xls (submitted on 18 November). The discrepancies are particularly large over the 2003-07 period. Dr. Sumner reports an average acreage

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-412

impact due to decoupled payments and crop insurance of 3.1 million acres over the 2003-07 period. Estimates by the US using Dr. Sumner's formulas find an impact of only 1.2 million acres. The inability to even remotely replicate Dr. Sumner's estimates casts serious doubts about the validity of his results. Dr. Sumner's calculations appear to be as arbitrary as his economic logic.
70. Brazil may cite the fact that the elasticity with respect to net returns is lower than the estimates published in Table I.3 of Annex I. While the United States is not able to verify the discrepancy, the elasticities used in the US calculations are based on data provided in the file FINAL US2003CropsModel WORKOUT.xls. Specifically, the elasticity in each year is determined by the formula (ai / Value of price deflator)*(Value of net returns / Value of cotton acres), where a1 is the coefficient on cotton net returns in the regional cotton acreage equation. The value of net returns and cotton acres are based on regional numbers in each year. This formulation is consistent with Dr. Sumner's documentation presented in Exhibit Bra-313.

72. Estimates by the United States for the 1999-2002 period are reasonably close to those offered by Dr. Sumner. However, there are large discrepancies over the 2003-07 period. It is inexplicable how the impact between the two periods can be so different. The differences cannot be explained by Dr. Sumner's method of incorporating alternative "coupling" factors.

VI. SUMNER MODIFICATIONS TO FAPRI MODEL DESCRIBED IN BRA-313 CONTAIN ERRORS
73. In Exhibit Bra-313, equation (2) on page 2 states that real net revenue for crop i in year (t-1) is a function of the price in (t-1) and the loan rate in (t-1), and other variables. It is this specification for real net revenue that determines acreage in year t, as described in equation (1). The combination of these two equations indicates that the loan rate in t-1 helps determine acreage in period t. In other words, Dr. Sumner's equation seems to assert it is last year's loan rate, and not the one in effect for this year's crop, that determines this year's plantings. Not only is this completely illogical, but it is in direct conflict with acreage equations previously developed by both FAPRI and USDA. The United States cannot determine if this equation reflects a lack of knowledge of the model, a broader deficiency in economics, or some previously unknown modification of the FAPRI or CARD models.
74. Dr. Sumner's documentation presented in equation (2) is inconsistent with equations contained in the files US CROPS MODEL 2002.xls (provided by Dr. Bruce Babcock on 26 November) and FINAL US2003CropsModel WORKOUT.xls (provided by Brazil on 18 November). Equation (2) defines real net revenue for crop i by taking the higher of the lagged farm price and the lagged loan rate, then multiplying by trend yield and subtracting variable costs. He further explains that this formulation applies to all crops except cotton and rice, where the marketing loan benefit depends on the difference between the loan rate and the AWP. However, in the two electronic versions of the crops model, which have been provided by Dr. Sumner and Dr. Babcock26, the formulation of expected net revenue is not consistent with Dr. Sumner's documentation. According to the electronic versions, all crops incorporate the marketing loan benefit by taking the difference between the loan rate and the loan repayment price. The United States and the Panel are left to wonder why there is a discrepancy between Dr. Sumner's documentation and the models that have been provided.
26 File US CROPS MODEL 2002.xls (provided by Dr. Bruce Babcock on 26 November) (Exhibit US116) and FINAL US2003CropsModel WORKOUT.xls (provided by Brazil on 18 November) (Exhibit US-115).

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-416

75. Exhibit Bra-313 and Annex I provide different and conflicting methodologies for incorporating the impacts of crop insurance and decoupled payments. According to equation (1) of Annex I, the formula for determining expected net revenue has been modified to include per-acre decoupled payments and crop insurance benefits. These net returns then determine cotton planted acreage. However, in equation (1a) of Bra-313, Dr. Sumner indicates that net revenue only considers returns from the market and the marketing loan. He then incorporates the impacts of decoupled payments and crop insurance by adding some arbitrary acreage impacts into the equation. As explained earlier27, the approach presented in Exhibit Bra-313 only serves to exaggerate his acreage impacts.

76. In equation (7), Dr. Sumner documents the equation specification for US cotton exports. His documentation indicates that exports in year t are a function of production in t-1, and other variables. Dr. Sumner's model suggests that last year's production directly determines this year's exports. This is both illogical and a departure from the specification included in the FAPRI framework.

VII. OVERALL PRICE RESPONSIVENESS OF THE ANNEX I MODEL

77. The overall price impacts generated by a model are determined by the underlying supply and demand elasticities within the system. If overall supply and demand are more elastic, or more responsive, then an external shock to the system will generate a smaller change in price than a system that is more inelastic.

78. In the case of the scenarios examined by Dr. Sumner, the external shocks to the model are the elimination of various aspects of the US cotton programme. According to Dr. Sumner's analysis, the removal of the US cotton programme leads to a reduction in planted area, production, and subsequently exports onto the world market. The reduced supplies into the world market generate an increase in world price, with the magnitude of the price increase determined by the overall elasticities embodied within the models for foreign production and consumption.

79. The following table provides a comparison of aggregate supply and demand elasticities for
foreign area and mill use. Based on individual country elasticities, the response of aggregate foreign
area and consumption can be calculated based on weights derived from recent historical data. The
elasticities reported in Table I.3 of Annex I are used to derive the aggregate elasticities of the SumnerCARD international cotton28 model provided by Brazil on 13 November. These are compared to
published research from Dr. Seth Meyer at FAPRI-University of Missouri, which reports more responsiveness in both area and consumption.29

80. The net trade position of countries outside of the US is one of a net importer. Since their consumption exceeds their production, their excess demand (ED) is defined as demand (D) ­ supply (S). The responsiveness of their excess demand (ED) is approximated by the elasticity of the

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-417
domestic demand less the elasticity of their domestic supply. In the case of the Meyer model, the elasticity of excess demand is -0.37 ­ 0.45 = -0.82. For the Sumner model, the elasticity of excess demand is -0.25 ­ 0.24 = -0.49. This fundamental difference has a direct impact on the price impacts generated by the model, as evidenced by the following chart. The line ED1 represents an excess demand curve with more price responsiveness, while ED2 is an excess demand curve with less elasticity. The intersection of excess demand outside of the United States with excess supply (ESUS) from the United States generates an equilibrium price. When there is a reduction in the excess supply from the United States, the elasticity of excess demand, which is reflected by the slope of the line has a direst impact on the change in price. Dr. Sumner's choice of international supply and demand elasticities leads to exaggerated price impacts.

VIII. CONCLUSION

Q

81. The Sumner models, as presented by Brazil, are so laden with faulty theory on programme impacts and so deviate from the FAPRI standards that they cannot provide any foundation for the Panel's analysis of the effect of challenged United States programmes with respect to upland cotton. Not only does the Sumner model contain major differences from previous FAPRI work, it also appears to be internally inconsistent as the United States has noted changes in described methodology from the original Annex I submission to later submissions, such as Exhibit Bra-313 and subsequent documentation.

82. Virtually all of the concerns of the United States cited in this critique are directed toward Brazil economic manipulation that exaggerates acreage impacts of the United States upland cotton programme.

· Brazil's impacts attributed to decoupled programmes deviate from traditional FAPRI analysis.

· Brazil's impacts attributed to crop insurance programme are not supported by FAPRI analysis.

· Brazil's impacts attributed to the export credit guarantee programme have no demonstrated economic foundation.

· Brazil's Annex I results used baselines that were inexplicably lower than even FAPRI's preliminary November 2002 baseline.

· Brazil's non-linear approach to results deviated from the traditional FAPRI methodology.

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-418
· Many of Dr. Sumner's adaptations contain errors. 83. In the final analysis, Brazil does not rely on the FAPRI model to prove its case, it relies on its manipulation of that model to ensure it obtains the desired results.

257. The Panel takes note of the Appellate Body Report in United States ­ Sunset Review of Anti-Dumping Duties on Corrosion-Resistant Carbon Steel Flat Products from Japan (DS244), which was circulated to WTO Members on 15 December 2003. The Panel is aware that this report has yet to be adopted by the Dispute Settlement Body. Nevertheless, the Panel asks the parties to respond to the following related questions.
(a) In that report, the Appellate Body cautioned against the "mechanistic" application of the so-called "mandatory/discretionary distinction" and stated that the import of this distinction may vary from case to case (para. 93). For the Appellate Body, the question of whether a measure is mandatory or not is relevant "if at all" only as part of the assessment of whether the measure is, as such, inconsistent with particular obligations. How, if at all, are these statements and the related findings concerning the mandatory/discretionary distinction in that Appellate Body Report relevant to:
(i) the legal standard and elements Brazil sets out to establish its export and prohibited subsidy claims under the provisions of the Agreement on Agriculture and Articles 3.1(a) and (b) of the SCM Agreement, concerning: BRA
- Step 2 payments (see, e.g. paras. 244-245 & 250 Brazil's first written submission; Panel Question 109 and parties' responses/comments thereon); and
- export credit guarantee programmes: GSM-102, GSM-103 and SCGP (see, e.g., para. 90 Brazil's oral statement at second Panel meeting).
(ii) the legal standard and elements Brazil sets out to establish its serious prejudice and "threat of serious prejudice" claims, and in particular, its designation of marketing loan; crop insurance; counter-cyclical payments; direct payments and Step 2 as "mandatory"? BRA
(iii) the legal standard and elements Brazil sets out to establish its "per se" "serious prejudice" claims (e.g. Brazil's 9 September further submission, para. 417 ff; US oral statement at second Panel meeting, para. 86 ff.)? BRA
The Appellate Body's Decision
1. Prior to answering the Panel's specific questions, Brazil makes the following introductory comments. Generally speaking, with respect to the Panel's Questions 257(a) ­ (c), Brazil does not believe that the Appellate Body Report in US ­ Corrosion-Resistant Steel has a significant impact on the legal standards or the elements of Brazil's "per se" or threat of serious prejudice claims. This is because, unlike the USDOC Policy Bulletin in US ­ Corrosion-Resistant Steel, the measures at issue in this dispute, on their face, require the payment of subsidies to eligible producers, users, and exporters. The record in this dispute shows that US government officials enjoy no flexibility to apply the US subsidy programmes in a WTO-consistent manner.
2. The US ­ Corrosion-Resistant Steel decision does make the important conclusion that panels cannot reject on a jurisdictional basis "per se" claims against measures that on their face are not mandatory.1 This Panel therefore need not examine whether the subsidy measures that Brazil has challenged are mandatory as a preliminary jurisdictional matter. However, this does not mean that the mandatory nature of measure is not important in deciding the merits of a "per se" (or threat of serious prejudice) claim. Indeed, the Appellate Body's analysis of the merits of Japan's "per se" claims in US ­ Corrosion-Resistant Steel appeared to turn largely on whether the measure was "mandatory", i.e., whether it required USDOC officials to analyze sunset reviews in a WTO-inconsistent manner.
1 Appellate Body Report, US ­ Corrosion-Resistant Steel, WT/DS244/AB/R, para. 88.

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-421
3. The Appellate Body held that "[w]hen a measure is challenged `as such,' the starting point for an analysis must be the measure on its face. If the meaning and content of the measure are clear on its face, then the consistency of the measure as such can be assessed on that basis alone".2 The Appellate Body in US ­ Corrosion-Resistant Steel found that the "as such" challenge "hinges upon whether [the Sunset Policy Bulletin] instruct[s] USDOC to treat dumping margins and/or import volumes as determinative or conclusive, on the one hand, or merely indicative or probative, on the other hand, of the likelihood of future dumping".3 Finding ambiguity in the text of the Bulletin (the use of the word "normally" and "good cause"), the Appellate Body held that the panel should have examined the history of the application of the Bulletin and individual decisions thereunder.4 Since the panel had failed to make the necessary factual findings, the Appellate Body was unable to complete the analysis and to rule on Japan's claim.5
4. Nevertheless, the Appellate Body's decision appears to stand for the proposition that "per se" challenges require demonstration that either the text or the operation of a measure creates requirements for government officials to act in a WTO-inconsistent manner. Where the text is not completely clear, the Appellate Body found that panels must determine whether the measure creates "normative" requirements, i.e., whether the measures are treated as binding by government officials, are interpreted as binding on executive branch officials by courts, or are consistently applied in a manner suggesting that the measures are considered to be mandates for action.6
5. Further, the US ­ Corrosion-Resistant Steel decision highlights the importance of challenges to legal/regulatory measures as a way to avoid repeated WTO dispute settlement challenges in "as applied" claims. In describing what is a "measure," the Appellate Body recalled:
[I]n GATT and WTO dispute settlement practice, panels have frequently examined measures consisting not only of particular acts applied only to a specific situation, but also of acts setting forth rules or norms that are intended to have general and prospective application. In other words, instruments of a Member containing rules or norms could constitute a "measure", irrespective of how or whether those rules or norms are applied in a particular instance. This is so because the disciplines of the GATT and the WTO, as well as the dispute settlement system, are intended to protect not only existing trade but also the security and predictability needed to conduct future trade. This objective would be frustrated if instruments setting out rules or norms inconsistent with a Member's obligations could not be brought before a panel once they have been adopted and irrespective of any particular instance of application of such rules or norms. It would also lead to a multiplicity of litigation if instruments embodying rules or norms could not be challenged as such, but only in the instances of their application. Thus, allowing claims against measures, as such, serves the purpose of preventing future disputes by allowing the root of WTO-inconsistent behaviour to be eliminated.7
6. Consistent with the language quoted above, Brazil's various challenges to US legal/regulatory instruments "per se" are intended to protect the security and predictability that Brazil's upland cotton producers need to conduct future trade. In addition, resolution of Brazil's separate threat of serious

prejudice claim under the EC ­ Sugar Exports and US ­ FSC rationales will prevent future disputes
by addressing the root cause of the United States' WTO-inconsistent behaviour ­ the absence of any
legal or regulatory limitations on subsidy payments, which creates a structural and permanent source of uncertainty in upland cotton markets.8 Brazil has demonstrated that the mandatory US subsidy
measures function to guarantee a high level of US upland cotton production and exports, and by
definition, act to suppress world prices because of the increased supply by US producers of a fungible commodity.9 Brazil further demonstrated that Brazilian producers are reluctant to engage in
significant investments in leasing or purchasing land for upland cotton production because of the uncertainty caused by locked-in US production.10 Brazil also recalls its position that requiring an
"imminent threat" standard, as proposed by the United States, would in effect require Members such
as Brazil to litigate claim after claim on the application of these measures, which threaten to cause
serious prejudice to its interests.

7. Finally, Brazil notes that the Appellate Body's conclusions in US ­ Corrosion-Resistant Steel
regarding the mandatory/discretionary distinction, although based on provisions of the Anti-Dumping
Agreement, are equally relevant to claims under any of the covered agreements, including Brazil's claims under the SCM Agreement, the Agreement on Agriculture, and Article XVI of GATT 1994.11

8. Application of the US ­ Corrosion-Resistant Steel criteria requires a complainant bringing a
per se claim to demonstrate that a measure does not provide relevant government officials with the flexibility to apply the measure in a WTO-consistent manner. As Brazil has argued12, US government
officials are not provided with any flexibility to make Step 2 subsidies under Section 1207(a) of the
2002 FSRI Act in a WTO-consistent manner. Thus, the Act violates Articles 3.3 and 8 of the
Agreement on Agriculture, and Articles 3.1(a) and 3.1(b) of the SCM Agreement. The United States
has conceded that "subject to the availability of funds (that is, the availability of CCC borrowing authority), Step 2 payments must be made to all those who meet the conditions for eligibility".13 The

Submission, Section 6.3; Exhibit Bra-283 (Statement of Christopher Ward ­ 7 October 2003); Brazil's
18 November 2003 Further Rebuttal Submission, para. 203. 11 The Appellate Body noted with respect to Article 17.3, the consultation clause of the Anti-Dumping
Agreement, that there is "no threshold requirement, in Article 17.3, that the measure in question be of a certain
type". Moreover, it has drawn the conclusion from the phrasing of Article 18.4 of the Anti-Dumping
Agreement that "the entire body of generally applicable rules, norms and standards adopted by Members in connection with the conduct of anti-dumping proceedings" should be potentially subject to dispute settlement.11
The provisions of Article 17.3 of the Anti-Dumping Agreement are closely modeled on those of GATT Article
XXIII:1 which are cross-referenced in Article 30 of the SCM Agreement and Article 19 of the Agreement on
Agriculture, and the provisions of Article 18.4 are virtually identical to Article XVI:3 of the Marrakesh
Agreement Establishing the WTO. 12 Brazil's 24 June 2003 First Submission, paras. 93-96, 244-45 and 250; Brazil's 22 August 2003

United States admits that "the CCC has a large" borrowing authority and "rarely has CCC run out of funds but it has happened for brief periods of time".14 Indeed, while the 1996 FAIR Act imposed a $701 million budgetary limit on the Step 2 programme during MY 1996-2001, this limit was reached by 1999. At the urging of the NCC, Congress eliminated the spending cap in 2000.15 Unlimited funding has existed ever since, including $415 million in expenditures in MY 2002 alone.16
9. The Secretary of the USDA must make payments pursuant to the plain text of Section 1207(a)(1), (2), and (4) of the 2002 FSRI Act (as set out in paragraph 245 of Brazil's 24 June First Submission). Consistent with the US ­ Corrosion-Resistant Steel decision, the evidence of mandatory payments demonstrates the absence of any flexibility for US officials to apply the programme in a WTO-consistent manner. Even if US authorities, acting in the best of faith, recognize that Step 2 payments are inconsistent with the US export subsidy obligations as well as with the prohibition on local content subsidies, Congress has not given them the discretion to stop the payments. Indeed, Congress has created a legal right for eligible recipients to demand and receive payments.
- export credit guarantee programmes: GSM-102, GSM-103 and SCGP (see, e.g., para. 90 Brazil's oral statement at second Panel meeting).
Brazil's Answer
10. The Appellate Body Report in US ­ Corrosion-Resistant Steel does not affect the legal standard and elements set out by Brazil to establish its claims against the GSM 102, GSM 103 and SCGP programmes under Articles 10.1 and 8 of the Agreement on Agriculture, and under Article 3.1(a) of the SCM Agreement. In fact, the mandatory/discretionary distinction is not relevant to Brazil's claims against the CCC export credit guarantee programmes under Article 10.1 of the Agreement on Agriculture.
11. Article 10.1 prohibits circumvention, and the threat of circumvention, of export subsidy reduction commitments. Brazil has demonstrated actual circumvention, by establishing that with respect to both unscheduled products17 and at least one scheduled product18, the United States has in fact circumvented its export subsidy reduction commitments. This is somewhat akin to an "as applied" claim, and it is therefore not relevant to this claim whether the CCC programmes are mandatory or discretionary.
12. Brazil has also demonstrated threat of circumvention. With respect to unscheduled products, the Appellate Body has held that it constitutes threat of circumvention to provide any export subsidies for unscheduled products.19 Having proven that CCC guarantees are export subsidies (under Articles 1.1 and 3.1(a) of the SCM Agreement, as well as item (j)), and having proven that those guarantees are available for unscheduled products20, Brazil demonstrated threat of circumvention, and a violation of Article 10.1. This is the standard set out by the Appellate Body in US ­ FSC; it does not appear to be relevant to this claim whether the CCC programmes are mandatory or discretionary.
13. With respect to scheduled products, the test under Article 10.1 is not whether the CCC programmes are "mandatory" as opposed to "discretionary". Rather, to determine whether CCC export credit guarantees for scheduled products threaten to lead to circumvention of the US export

subsidy reduction commitments, Brazil has noted that the test set out by the Appellate Body in US ­ FSC is whether the CCC can "stem[], or otherwise control[], the flow of" CCC export credit guarantees. Brazil has demonstrated that CCC cannot do so.21 One fact Brazil has noted is that the CCC programmes are "mandatory," as that term is defined in US law.22 (In Brazil's view, the CCC programmes are also "mandatory," within the meaning of WTO/GATT law).
14. Brazil also claims that the CCC export credit guarantee programmes constitute prohibited export subsidies under Articles 1.1 and 3.1(a) of the SCM Agreement. Brazil has demonstrated that the CCC programmes confer "benefits" per se, within the meaning of Article 1.1(b) of the SCM Agreement (as well as that they are financial contributions and are de jure contingent on export). Brazil has relied on three types of evidence and argument to make this per se showing, as summarized in paragraphs 231-241 of its 18 November 2003 Further Rebuttal Submission. These three types of evidence and argument demonstrate that every time a CCC guarantee is issued, a benefit is conferred per se. This is effectively the equivalent of saying that the CCC programmes "mandate" a violation.
15. Finally, Brazil also claims that the CCC export credit guarantee programmes constitute prohibited export subsidies under item (j) of the Illustrative List of Export Subsidies included as Annex I to the SCM Agreement. Brazil does not consider that, to the extent the traditional mandatory/discretionary principle was modified by the Appellate Body in US Corrosion-Resistant Steel, those modifications have any impact on Brazil's claim.
16. Moreover, Brazil does not consider that it is particularly useful to determine whether Brazil's claim is "as applied" or "as such", thus necessitating a determination whether the CCC programmes are "mandatory" or "discretionary". Indeed, the Appellate Body in US Corrosion-Resistant Steel stressed that the "import of the `mandatory/discretionary distinction' may vary from case to case", cautioning "against the application of this distinction in a mechanistic fashion".23 Item (j) imposes a sui generis standard ­ it calls for an evaluation whether the CCC programmes are offered at premium rates that are inadequate to cover the long-term operating costs and losses of the programmes. Brazil has established these elements in two ways. First, using a number of methodologies, Brazil has looked at historical data concerning premiums collected and costs and losses incurred, to establish that costs and losses incurred exceeded premiums collected over a 10-year period.24 Second, Brazil used statements by USDA's Office of the Inspector General and the US General Accounting Office to establish that premium rates for the CCC programmes, and not just premiums collected, do not and will continue not to meet costs because they do not, and are not adjusted to, offset credit risks, and are, further, capped at one per cent.25 Given the forward-looking nature of this analysis, Brazil does not agree with the United States that item (j) necessarily "requires a certain retrospection".26

Brazil's Answer
17. The US ­ Corrosion-Resistant Steel decision does not significantly change Brazil's analysis of its serious prejudice or threat of serious prejudice claims. There has never been an issue whether the statutes and regulations providing for the five US subsidies referred to in the Panel's question are "mandatory" ­ this has been clear from the face of the statutory and regulatory provisions, as set out in Brazil's earlier submissions and even acknowledged by the United States.27 The record establishes that marketing loan, crop insurance, direct and counter-cyclical payments, and Step 2 payments are "mandatory" provisions ­ payments and expenditures are required to be made by US Government officials to eligible producers, users or exporters.28
18. The mandatory nature of the US subsidies is relevant to (a) Brazil's "per se" claims as well as (b) Brazil's threat of serious prejudice claims that do not involve claims regarding the "per se" validity of the statutes. The evidence of mandatory (or "normative") measures is a required element for Brazil's "per se" claims. And a threat of serious prejudice under Article 6.3 and 5(c) will be more likely to exist if the subsidies are mandatory, i.e., that the subsidies must be paid to eligible producers, exporters, and users. The record demonstrates that there are no provisions in US law limiting the payments, and, thus, limiting the threat of serious prejudice (i.e., significant price suppression, increased world market share for US exports, or inequitable share of world trade). The so-called "circuit-breaker" in the 2002 FSRI Act is not applicable to individual commodities, but instead only to total US AMS.29 The United States has admitted that there is no provision in US law that stops subsidy payments when serious prejudice is caused to other WTO Members.30 In particular, there was no flexibility provided to US government officials to limit upland cotton payments at any time during MY 1999-2002. When prices plunged to record lows in MY 2001 and MY 2002, USDA poured funds into sustaining high levels of US upland cotton production and exports. The participants in the world market know this will happen again when prices fall. And world producers, such as those from Brazil, as well as traders discovering prices in the New York futures markets, know that this means that US production and exports will remain high for the remainder of the 2002 FSRI Act.31
27 See Brazil's 9 September 2003 Further Submission, Sections 4.2.1-4.2.5 (summarized in paragraph 423); US 27 October 2003 Answer to Question 162, para 95 ("The statutory authority for marketing loan payments, step 2 payments, and counter-cyclical payments does not provide the Secretary with the authority to arbitrarily decline to make these payments to qualified recipients."); para. 97 ("there is no present limit on the total amount of payments that can be made under each of these programmes although for counter-cyclical payments a maximum total outlay can be calculated using the base acres, base yields, and maximum payment rate for each commodity produced during the historical base period".).
28 See also Brazil's Answer to Question 257(b) below. 29 US 2 December 2003 Oral Statement para 82. US 22 December 2003 Answer to Question 253, para. 180. 30 US 22 December 2003 Answer to Question 253, para. 180 (the circuit-breaker provision "does not appear to contemplate any such finding of serious prejudice, but rather is seemingly focused more particularly on the overall level of expenditures as that was the only restriction agreed to in this instance by the United States ... ".). 31 The absence of any "circuit breaker" for upland cotton is significant given the fact that producers of upland cotton received far more per unit and ad valorem subsidies than any other US commodity during MY 1999-2002 (Brazil's 9 September 2003 Further Submission, para. 4). No other US crop has a "competitiveness" subsidy such as Step 2, which paid $415 million to US users and exporters of upland cotton in MY 2002. No other US crop had counter-cyclical payments of over $1 billion in MY 2002. No other US crop had such large per unit marketing loan payments during MY 1999-2002. These huge guaranteed payments, along with the unlimited amount of upland cotton that can receive benefits from marketing loan, Step 2, and crop insurance subsidies, together with the very high per-acre direct and counter-cyclical payments (compared to other programme crops), together constitutes strong evidence that these measures have not, are not, and will not be applied in the future in a WTO-consistent manner.

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-426
19. This permanent threat of serious prejudice is similar to "threat of circumvention" of export subsidy reduction commitments, under Article 10.1 of the Agreement on Agriculture. In US ­ FSC, the Appellate Body held that the absence of any legal mechanism that can "stem[], or otherwise control[], the flow of"32 subsidies creates a threat of circumvention. Again, as in this dispute, in US ­ FSC and EC ­ Sugar Exports, there was no legal mechanism to limit the amount of potential subsidies that could be paid. The threat was and is tangible
20. The price-trigger mechanism contained in certain of the programmes does not minimize the threat of serious prejudice. In fact, the very existence of the mandatory marketing loan, Step 2 and counter-cyclical payment programme alone impacts farmers' planting decisions. Even when farmers expect market price levels that would not trigger these payments, farmers know that there is a certain likelihood that their expectations will turn out to be wrong and prices will turn out much lower than anticipated. However, history has taught US upland cotton producers to know with certainty that they will not suffer any economic harm from their misperception of prices for the upcoming marketing year. Any downside market revenue risk is covered by the combined effects of the marketing loan and counter-cyclical payment programmes, as well as by the effects of certain crop insurance policies such as revenue insurance. In short, the mandatory US subsidies mean that high US production and exports are guaranteed.
21. Further, these programmes have effects on production decisions of US farmers via a second mechanism, as Brazil and Professor Sumner have detailed at the second meeting of the Panel.33 Even if farmers expect upland cotton prices (cash prices as well as the adjusted world price) to be above the trigger prices for marketing loan, counter-cyclical and Step 2 payments, farmers will expect with a certain likelihood that prices might nevertheless turn out to be below these trigger prices, i.e., farmers have a probability distribution for expected prices. Given this probability distribution, Professor Sumner explained at the second meeting of the Panel that farmers would still expect some payments from these programmes.34 Thus, these programmes impact farmers planting decisions, increasing and locking in a high US supply of upland cotton that causes adverse effects.
22. Finally, Brazil has demonstrated that the "chilling effect" of guaranteed US subsidies leads to reduced investment of Brazilian farmers in upland cotton production.35 Indeed, USDA itself acknowledges ­ with respect to soybeans, but equally applicable to upland cotton ­ that low international prices have had negative impacts on additional investments and increases in production in Brazil.36 This "chilling effect" is the result of Brazilian and other countries' farmers' perception of the threat of serious prejudice from the US upland cotton subsidies.

Brazil's Answer
23. As detailed in Brazil's answer to Question 257(a)(ii) and (b), marketing loan, Step 2, crop insurance, direct and counter-cyclical payment subsidies are mandatory within the traditional mandatory/discretionary distinction. Thus, the Appellate Body decision in US ­ Corrosion-Resistant Steel does not affect the legal standard and elements for Brazil's per se claims against those subsidy programmes.37
(b) How and to what extent are the legal and regulatory provisions cited in paras. 415 and 423 of Brazil's 9 September further submission "normative" in nature and treated as binding within the US legal system (see, e.g., para. 99 of the Appellate Body Report)? Does your response differ depending on whether the payments are dependent upon market price conditions? BRA
Brazil's Answer
24. Brazil understands the ordinary meaning of "normative" to be "establishing a norm or standard of; deriving from or implying a standard or norm; prescriptive".38 In the sense of the term used by the Appellate Body in US ­ Corrosion-Resistant Steel, the US statutes and regulations summarized in paragraphs 415 and 423 of Brazil's 9 September Further Submission39 are "normative" because they establish (a) obligations for US officials to make payments, and (b) legal rights for eligible producers, users, and exporters to receive the payments. As used by the Appellate Body, the term "normative" includes as a subcategory the group of measures that are mandatory, within the meaning of the traditional mandatory/discretionary distinction.
25. The United States has acknowledged that the "statutory authority for marketing loan payments, step 2 payments, and counter-cyclical payments does not provide the Secretary with the authority to arbitrarily decline to make these payments to qualified recipients".40 In addition, the direct payment provisions of the 2002 FSRI Act similarly provide that "payment [is] required" and the "Secretary shall make direct payments to producers on farms for which payment yields and base acres are established".41 Finally, the crop insurance payment provisions of the 2000 ARP Act also create "norms" in the form of mandated payments of subsidies for "catastrophic risk protection" and "alternative catastrophic coverage" that "shall" be provided to all eligible producers.42 Thus, the statutory and regulatory provisions mandating payments for each of these five types of subsidies are, by any reasonable definition, "normative" measures.
26. The Panel asks further whether Brazil's response differs depending on whether the payments are dependent upon market price conditions. The answer is "no".
27. As Brazil has argued before, the fact that marketing loan, counter-cyclical and Step 2 payments may not be made due to higher prices does not mean that these subsidy programmes are not mandatory.43 The focus for deciding whether a measure is mandatory or discretionary is on whether it
37 While a per se claims against non-mandatory measures under Article 5(c) and footnote 13 of the SCM Agreement seems possible, the Panel is not faced with such a situation in this case, as all the measures challenged by Brazil are, in fact, of a mandatory nature.
38 New Shorter Oxford Dictionary, 1993 edition, p. 1941. 39 Each of these statutory and regulatory provisions were discussed in more detail in paragraphs 312341 of Brazil's 9 September 2003 Further Submission. 40 US 27 October 2003 Answer to Question 162, para 95. 41 Brazil's 9 September 2003 Further Submission, para. 333 citing Section 1103(a) of the 2002 FSRI Act. 42 Brazil's 9 September 2003 Further Submission, para. 319 citing Section 508(b)(1), (2), and 508(c)(1)(A) of the 2000 ARP Act. 43 Brazil's 7 October 2003 Oral Statement, paras. 50-51.

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-428
provides government officials with the discretion to implement the measure in a WTO-consistent manner.44 But the terms of the statutes/regulations provide no discretion or flexibility to any US Government official when low prices trigger the required marketing loan and counter-cyclical payments or when high prices lead payments to phase out temporarily. Rather, price levels are an eligibility condition for payment, similar to conditioning eligibility of a producer for contract payments on his not growing fruits and vegetables.
28. Objective conditions, such as market price movements, or objective eligibility criteria are not appropriately considered in determining whether a measure gives an implementing official "discretion" to act in a WTO-consistent fashion. For example, the FSC measure payments were only available where the income concerned was of foreign origin. Despite the fact that non-foreign sourced income would thus be excluded from FSC benefits, the measure was still found to threaten the circumvention of export subsidy requirements. Similarly, Step 2 payments are only available if an exporter is regularly engaged in the business of exporting upland cotton. The fact that a USDA official cannot legally make a Step 2 payment to a non-eligible exporter does not make the Step 2 programme "discretionary". And the fact that no marketing loan payments are available for upland cotton when the adjusted world price exceeds 52 cents per pound does not mean that the billions of dollars of payments made during MY 1999-2002, when prices were below that level, were "discretionary".
29. The United States argues that measures are "discretionary" if there are any conditions attached to payments ­ regardless of whether the executive official is permitted to exercise any discretion in refusing to make the payment. Such an interpretation would read out any meaning to the "mandatory/discretionary" distinction. Of course, at some level of abstraction, it is possible to create scenarios under which subsidies might not be paid. For example, the US Congress could decide to impose actual limits on CCC funding or change the 2002 FSRI Act to include a cotton "circuitbreaker" provision to limit cotton payments. But these theoretical possibilities do not make the existing mandatory text of the 2002 FSRI and 2000 ARP Act discretionary.
30. However, even if these existing texts were not mandatory on their face (which they are), the US ­ Corrosion-Resistant Steel decision teaches that the Panel must give weight to the long-term application of the measure to determine its normative character. The fact that billions of dollars in marketing loan, Step 2, counter-cyclical and direct payment were paid to US upland cotton producers, users and exporters of upland cotton over the past four years is highly relevant evidence for that determination. So is the fact that billions more will be paid before the 2002 FSRI ends in MY 2007. The provisions of these programmes have never been applied in a "discretionary" manner. Not a single eligible upland cotton farmer, user or exporter has been denied payment under these programmes by USDA officials. This is because there is simply no discretion vested in any US official to decide, independent of any objective market conditions or eligibility criteria, not to make these payments. Therefore, they are mandatory within the meaning WTO/GATT precedent, including the US ­ Corrosion-Resistant Steel decision.
(c) Does Brazil challenge as "mandatory" the "subsidies" themselves, the subsidy programmes or the legal/regulatory provisions for the grant or maintenance of those subsidies, or something else? BRA
Brazil's Answer
31. With respect to the Panel's question, Brazil does not believe that there is any difference between the "subsidy programmes" and the "legal/regulatory provisions" for the grant or maintenance of the subsidies.
44 Appellate Body Report, US ­ 1916 Act, WT/DS132/AB/R, para. 100.

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-429
32. With respect to Brazil's "per se" claim, it challenges as "mandatory" the legal/regulatory provisions for the grant or maintenance of the subsidies.45
33. Brazil's "threat of serious prejudice" claim also challenges as "mandatory" the legal/regulatory provisions for the grant or maintenance of the subsidies. However, in this claim Brazil is not challenging the text of these provisions in the traditional "per se" sense, but rather under the rationale of the EC ­ Sugar Exports precedent. Under this claim, the mandatory nature of the largely unlimited subsidies required to be provided in MY 2003-2007 under the 2002 FSRI Act and the 2000 ARP Act (and implementing regulations) is key evidence demonstrating an ongoing, significant threat of significant price suppression and increased and inequitable US world market shares in the period MY 2003-2007.
34. In Brazil's view, a "threat of serious prejudice" claim is, in the Panel's word, "something else" ­ a sui generis claim. Brazil considers that the Appellate Body was advising against slavish adherence to the "per se" and "as applied" labels ­ intimately related to the traditional mandatory/discretionary distinction ­ when it cautioned in US ­ Corrosion Resistant Steel "against the application of this distinction in a mechanistic fashion".46 If a claimant proves the elements of a threat claim, as set out in EC ­ Sugar Exports and US ­ FSC, it succeeds on the merits, regardless whether the claim is labelled "per se" or "as applied" ­ terms which are not themselves found in Part III of the SCM Agreement.
35. In the case of a "threat" claim, this note of caution is particularly apt. In proving its threat of serious prejudice claim, Brazil has followed the rationale in EC ­ Sugar Exports and US ­ FSC, demonstrating the "mandatory" nature of the legal/regulatory instruments by which the subsidies are paid, together with the unlimited amount of products that may receive the subsidies, and the extent to which those legal/regulatory instruments fail to stem or control the flow of the subsidies.47 Brazil has backed up this evidence with historical data regarding the unlimited way in which the legal/regulatory instruments have been applied to grant payments to US upland cotton farmers during the period MY 1999-2002.
36. This data gives context to the nature and extent of the threat posed by the mandatory legal/regulatory instruments at hand. The data is critical, because it demonstrates that even if the measures are not mandatory (which they are), the US authorities have always applied the measures in a way that would cause serious prejudice. Since payments have never been withheld, the data demonstrates, at the very least, that the US authorities treat the measures as "normative", as that term was used by the Appellate Body in US ­ Corrosion Resistant Steel.48
37. Brazil turns now to its claims regarding the three CCC export credit guarantee programmes. As discussed in Brazil's response to question 257(a)(i), Article 10.1 prohibits circumvention, and the threat of circumvention, of export subsidy reduction commitments. As discussed above, Brazil has demonstrated actual circumvention with respect to both unscheduled products and at least one scheduled product. This is somewhat akin to an "as applied" claim against guarantees issued under the CCC programmes. It is therefore not relevant to this claim whether the CCC programmes are mandatory or discretionary.
38. Brazil has also demonstrated that the three CCC programmes pose a threat of circumvention. Brazil's threat of circumvention claims are against the programmes as such. With respect to unscheduled products, it constitutes threat of circumvention to provide any export subsidies for
45 Brazil's 9 September 2003 Further Submission, paras. 422-423. 46 Appellate Body Report, US ­ Corrosion-Resistant Steel, WT/DS244/AB/R, para. 93. 47 Brazil refers the Panel to the additional discussion regarding the mandatory nature of the US measures and Brazil's threat of serious prejudice claim in its Answer to Question 257(a)(ii) supra. 48 Appellate Body Report, US ­ Corrosion-Resistant Steel, WT/DS244/AB/R, para. 93.

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-430
unscheduled products. Under US ­ FSC, it does not appear to be relevant to this claim whether the CCC programmes are mandatory or discretionary. With respect to unscheduled products, the test under Article 10.1 is whether export subsidies are made available to those products. With respect to scheduled products, the test under Article 10.1 is also not whether the CCC programmes are "mandatory" as opposed to "discretionary". Rather, the question set out in US ­ FSC is whether the CCC can "stem[], or otherwise control[], the flow of" CCC export credit guarantees. Brazil has demonstrated that CCC cannot do so.
39. Brazil turns now to its claims under Articles 1.1 and 3.1(a) of the SCM Agreement, which are against the CCC programmes themselves. Brazil has demonstrated that the CCC programmes confer "benefits" per se, within the meaning of Article 1.1(b) of the SCM Agreement (as well as that they are financial contributions and are de jure contingent on export). Brazil has demonstrated that every time a CCC guarantee is issued, a benefit is conferred per se. This is effectively the equivalent of saying that the CCC programmes themselves "mandate" a violation, under the traditional meaning of the mandatory/discretionary principle.
40. Finally, Brazil's claims under item (j) of the Illustrative List of Export Subsidies are both against guarantees granted under the three CCC programmes, and against the CCC programmes themselves. First, Brazil has demonstrated that, retrospectively, costs and losses incurred by the programmes exceeded premiums collected over a 10-year period. This is somewhat akin to an "as applied" claim against guarantees issued under the CCC programmes. It is therefore not relevant to this claim whether the CCC programmes are mandatory or discretionary. Second, Brazil has demonstrated that, looking forward, premium rates for the CCC programmes, and not just premiums collected, do not and will continue not to meet costs because they do not, and are not adjusted to, offset credit risks, and are, further, capped at one percent.49 As statements by USDA's Office of the Inspector General and the US General Accounting Office demonstrate, the CCC programmes do not have the flexibility under US law to offset credit risks and meet costs. This is effectively the equivalent of saying that the CCC programmes themselves "mandate" a violation, under the traditional meaning of the mandatory/discretionary principle.
(d) Does the "requirement" upon the CCC to make available "not less than" $5.5 billion annually in guarantees have a normative character and operation? (see, e.g. Brazil's response to Panel Question 142; Exhibit BRA-297, 7 USC 5641(b)(1); 7 USC 5622(a) & (b); paragraph 201 of US 18 November further rebuttal submissions). Is this requirement "mandatory"? If so, how does the CCC have "discretion" not to make this amount of guarantees available in a given year? USA
Brazil's Comment
41. Brazil offered the evidence mentioned by the Panel (as well as evidence regarding CCC's obligation to make available an additional annual amount of at least $1 billion in direct credits or guarantees for exports to "emerging markets"50) to demonstrate, with respect to scheduled products, its threat of circumvention claim under Article 10.1 of the Agreement on Agriculture. Brazil has already noted that the test under Article 10.1 is not whether the CCC programmes are "mandatory" as opposed to "discretionary". Rather, to determine whether CCC export credit guarantees for scheduled
49 For this reason, Brazil does not agree with the United States that an item (j) analysis necessarily "requires a certain retrospection" (US 22 December 2003 Answers to Questions, para. 102).
50 See Exhibit Bra-366 (7 U.S.C. § 5622 note, "Promotion of Agricultural Exports to Emerging Markets, para.

(e) Does the US agree that, under the Budget Enforcement Act of 1990, the Office of Management and Budget classifies the export credit guarantee programmes as "mandatory" (see Brazil's response to Panel Question 142, para. 89)? Does this exempt the programmes from the requirement to receive new Congressional budget authority before it undertakes new guarantee commitments (e.g. Exhibit BRA-117 (2 USC 661(c)(2))? USA
Brazil's Comment
42. As noted in Brazil's response to question 257(a)(i), Brazil has provided evidence that the CCC programmes are "mandatory," within the meaning of that term under US law (although that is not to say that the CCC programmes are not also mandatory, within the meaning of WTO/GATT law).
258. Please submit a detailed explanation of the method by which one could calculate total expenditures to producers of upland cotton under the four relevant programmes on the basis of the data which it seeks. BRA
Brazil's Answer
43. Brazil appreciates the opportunity to describe to the Panel the methodology that it will apply to the data, should the United States produce it on 20 January 2004. As the Panel noted in its 12 January Communication, the United States failed on 18/19 December 2003 to comply with its obligation to provide the requested data in a non-"scrambled" form. Therefore, Brazil is not in a position to apply the methodology discussed below and to present its results to the Panel today. If the United States does not produce non-scrambled and otherwise complete data responsive to the Panel's request, on 28 January 2004, Brazil will provide further comments and make requests as appropriate.
44. Generally, Brazil's methodology will calculate the amount of expenditures that support upland cotton production by examining farm-specific contract and planted acreage data. For each of these farms, Brazil would calculate the amount of contract payments for each crop for which the upland cotton farm has base acreage.51 To that end, for each crop, the amount of contract payment units (as provided by the United States52) would be multiplied by the payment rate for the subsidy programme (PFC, market loss assistance, direct and counter-cyclical payments) in the marketing year in question.53 Brazil will allocate crop contract payments to the respective crop for which they are made for each farm, up to the amount of acreage actually planted to that crop. For example, any contract payment for an upland cotton base acre that is actually planted to upland cotton is deemed
51 These crops include all crops that constitute programme crops for purposes of the PFC, market loss assistance, direct and counter-cyclical payment programmes.
52 In case the United States does not provide the payments units with its 20 January 2004 data, they can be easily calculated by multiplying the contract acreage for a crop with the payment yield for that crop. The payments units are calculated as 85 percent of that figure.
53 Exhibit Bra-394 (Agricultural Outlook Tables, USDA, November 2003, Table 19 provides payment rates for PFC, direct and counter-cyclical payments in a column called "income support rates" for marketing years 1999-2002. However, rice payments for MY 2002 appear to be reported in error, since no rice countercyclical payments were made. In fact, the full rice counter-cyclical payment was made in MY 2002 (see Exhibit Bra-173 (Revised Estimate of Support Granted by Commodity via Counter-Cyclical Payments)). The full rice CCP is $1.65 (see Exhibit Bra-27 ("Side by Side Comparison of the 1996 and 2002 Farm Act, p. 2-5) report the rice target price as $10.50 per cwt, the direct payment rate as $2.35 per cwt and the loan rate as $6.50 per cwt, resulting in a full CCP payment of $1.65 per cwt or $0.00748 per pound).

support to upland cotton. If non-upland cotton base acres on a farm are planted to upland cotton, payments made for these base acres would also be deemed to constitute support to upland cotton.

45. Application of Brazil's methodology would require the writing of a simple computer programme that calculates the contract payments that constitute support to upland cotton for any farm in the United States that receives contract payments and plants upland cotton. The individual farm data would then be tabulated to calculate a total amount of expenditures provided in support of the production of upland cotton.

46. Brazil provides below additional details concerning its methodology. The data that has been withheld by the United States will show farms with many different combinations of base acreage and upland cotton plantings. There may be farms with more upland cotton base acres than planted acres, or with less base acres than planted acres. There may be farms that plant only upland cotton, or farms that have other programme crops as well. Finally, farms may have more or less crop base acreage than they plant to programme crops. Brazil systematically presents below a number of sample farms and illustrates how its allocation methodology will be applied to the actual data for each type of farms.

47. In a first step, Brazil considers three general categories of upland cotton farms: (1) those with
fewer planted upland cotton acres than upland cotton base acres, (2) those with more planted upland
cotton acres than upland cotton base acres, and (3) those planting cotton without any upland cotton base acres.54 The table below illustrates this for the three categories of farms:

Sample Farm 1 plants 50 acres of its 100 upland cotton base acres to upland cotton. Thus, any payments for these 50 upland cotton base acres constitute support to upland cotton.55 Since contract payments for all acres planted to upland cotton are allocated therewith, the calculation ends for this farm (and any farm in a similar position). Any payments associated with the other 50 upland cotton base acres are not considered, as they do not constitute support to upland cotton. Sample Farm 2 plants 150 acres of upland cotton, but has only 100 acres of upland cotton base. The entire upland cotton base payments, therefore, constitute support to upland cotton. Sample Farm 3 plants 100 acres of upland cotton, but has no upland cotton base. No upland cotton base payments can be allocated in this case. Thus, in this overly simple methodology, support to upland cotton would be calculated only by adding up the amount of upland cotton payments received on land that currently produces upland cotton. However, Brazil believes the Panel should also include as support to upland cotton contract payments on non-upland cotton base acreage that is currently planted to upland cotton. For example, for Sample Farms 2 and 3 above, for which payments for less upland cotton acres than actually planted were allocated in this first step, additional contract payments made for other contract crop base could be allocated as support to upland cotton in a second step, provided they are available on

54 In later steps, Brazil will discuss what happens when the farms have other crop contract payment base and how this may be allocated.
55 The amount payments results from multiplying the payment rate for the contract crop, including for
upland cotton, by the amount of base acres involved. The respective contract payment amounts to 85 per cent of this figure. Payment rates are published by USDA, see Exhibit Bra-394 (Agricultural Outlook Tables, USDA,
November 2003, Table 19).

the farm. These additionally allocated contract payments stem from contract payments made for other crops and not allocated to these other crops.

48. However, as with upland cotton contract payments, any contract payments for other crop base would be primarily assigned as support to the production of those crops. As with upland cotton contract payments, any other programme crop base payments are treated as support to those crops up to the amount of base acreage that is actually planted to the respective programme crop. Payments on any further base acreage for those programme crops are allocated to the crops for which planted acres exceed base acres. The following table illustrates this for Sample Farm 4:

Sample Farm 4 Crop Crop Base Crop Plantings Crop Base Allocated as Support for the Crop in Question Remaining Crop Base Available for Allocation Crop Plantings To Which Additional Payments Will Be Allocated

Cotton 100 acres 160 acres 100 acres
0 acres
60 rice acres

Rice 100 acres 40 acres 40 acres
60 acres
0 acres

Corn 100 acres 100 acres 100 acres
0 acres
0 acres

Sample Farm 4 plants three crops (upland cotton, rice and corn) having 100 base acres for each crop. All 100 corn base acres are planted to corn and, thus, any corn contract payments made for the corn base constitute support to corn. However, only 40 of the 100 rice base acres are planted to rice and, consequently, only payments for those 40 rice base acres constitute support to rice. Sample Farm 4 plants 160 acres of upland cotton, but has only 100 upland cotton base acres. Thus, all payments on the entire 100 upland cotton base acres represent support to cotton. In addition, payments for the 60 rice base acres not planted to rice but to upland cotton also represent support to upland cotton.

49. Sample Farm 4 was a farm for which the total base acreage and the total acreage planted to programme crops were equal. However, there may be instances in which farms plant more (or less) acreage to programme crops than they used to do in the past establishing their base acreage.

50. The following two tables explain how Brazil's methodology addresses the issue of farms that
plant more acreage to programme crops than they have base acreage (Sample Farm 5) and farms that plant less acreage to programme crops than they have base acreage (Sample Farm 6).56 In Brazil's
methodology, payments available for allocation ­ i.e., not allocated to the programme crop itself ­ are pooled and allocated proportionally to the remaining programme crop acreage.57 Brazil's approach of
pooling payments from additional base acres not planted to the respective programme crop and
allocating these payments proportionally as support to crops, for which plantings exceeds base
acreage, ensures that a single dollar is not allocated to two different crops, resulting in double

56 Brazil exemplifies the principle for farms with less upland cotton base than upland cotton plantings, but the same principle applies to farms without any upland cotton base.
57 Since the United States has not provided the data necessary to do this allocation, Brazil has no information on how often such situations actually occur. However, the record strongly suggests that not many farms would be able to plant more program crops than they have base acreage. In particular for upland cotton, Brazil has demonstrated that it is not economically possible to produce this crop without contract payments. See inter alia Brazil's 2 December 2003 Oral Statement, paras. 26-27 and Exhibit Bra-353 (Cumulative Loss From Upland Cotton Production MY 1997-2002 Without Contract Payments).

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-434

counting.58 It also ensures that each contract payment dollar is allocated to a programme crop, as exemplified by the calculations for Sample Farms 5 and 6 below.

51. The first table shows the allocation of contract payments on Sample Farm 5, a farm with fewer planted (370 acres) than base acres (400 acres).

52. The second table shows the allocation of contract payments on Sample Farm 6, a farm with more planted (410 acres) than base acres (400 acres).

58 The United States alleges that Brazil's 14/16th methodology would allocate the same contract payments to two different crops resulting in double counting (see e.g. US 2 December 2003 Oral Statement, para. 27). The US claim about double counting by Brazil originates in an entirely erroneous understanding of Brazil's 14/16th methodology. As explained many times, Brazil used this methodology only as a proxy, since the United States refused to provide the very data that would allow the calculation of the exact amount of support to upland cotton from contract payments. It makes the assumption that for any acre planted to upland cotton an average contract payment in the amount of an upland cotton contract payment is received.

53. In both cases, the contract payments on wheat and rice base acres that are not allocated to
production of these crops (as current plantings are below the base acreage) are pooled. The resulting
amount of contract payments is distributed as support to upland cotton and corn with the share of both crops corresponding to the ratio of plantings to which additional payments are allocated.59

54. This same principle would be applied for farms that have no upland cotton base acreage. For these farms, contract payments would be allocated to upland cotton solely from the pool of payments made on crop base not planted to the respective programme crop. This is illustrated in the table below (Sample Farm 7).

59 Additional payments will only be allocated to planted crop acres exceeding the amount of base acreage.

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-436
55. For Sample Farm 7 with no upland cotton base but 100 acres of upland cotton plantings, contract payments would be allocated from the rice and corn base not allocated to these crops. In this case payments on 50 rice and 50 corn base acres are allocated to upland cotton. On average, the peracre payment from those crop base acres is similar to the amount of upland cotton base acre payments.

ANNEX I-11
ANSWERS OF THE UNITED STATES TO FURTHER QUESTIONS FROM THE PANEL TO THE PARTIES FOLLOWING THE SECOND PANEL MEETING
20 January 2004
257. The Panel takes note of the Appellate Body Report in United States ­ Sunset Review of Anti-Dumping Duties on Corrosion-Resistant Carbon Steel Flat Products from Japan (DS244), which was circulated to WTO Members on 15 December 2003. The Panel is aware that this report has yet to be adopted by the Dispute Settlement Body. Nevertheless, the Panel asks the parties to respond to the following related questions.
(d) Does the "requirement" upon the CCC to make available "not less than" $5.5 billion annually in guarantees have a normative character and operation? (see, e.g. Brazil's response to Panel Question 142; Exhibit BRA-297, 7 USC 5641(b)(1); 7 USC 5622(a) & (b); paragraph 201 of US 18 November further rebuttal submissions). Is this requirement "mandatory"? If so, how does the CCC have "discretion" not to make this amount of guarantees available in a given year? USA
1. With respect to the Panel's first question, the United States notes that the Appellate Body's discussion of the "normative character and operation" of an instrument came in the context of its explanation of how to determine whether an instrument is a "measure" subject to challenge in dispute settlement and that the Appellate Body distinguished this question from the separate question of whether the instrument, if a measure, mandates a breach of a WTO obligation under a "mandatory/discretionary" analysis.1 The Appellate Body explicitly noted that it was not undertaking a comprehensive examination of the relevance or significance of that analysis and, indeed, simply applied it.2 An analysis of the normative character and operation of this "requirement" to make available not less than $5.5 billion in guarantees is not necessary because the parties do not dispute whether the "requirement" is a "measure."
2. Under a "mandatory/discretionary" analysis, the relevant question would be not whether the requirement to make available $5.5 billion in guarantees per year is as such inconsistent with a provision of the WTO agreements (since Brazil has not claimed that it is), but rather whether the provisions establishing the export credit guarantee programmes mandate a breach of any WTO obligation. As we have explained, they do not. As an initial matter, the requirement that the CCC "make available . . . not less than $5,500,000,000 in credit guarantees" does not mandate that the CCC actually issue any particular level of credit guarantees.3 This law merely requires that CCC "make available" certain guarantees; the actual issuance of guarantees, however, is within the discretion of the Commodity Credit Corporation, which "may guarantee the repayment of credit made available to

2 US Sunset Review, paras. 93, 156, and 172-174. 3 As the United States has previously noted, except for programme year 1992, CCC has never issued $5.5 billion in guarantees in any year during the period 1992 to the present. Sales registrations have been as low as $2.876 billion for programme year 1997 and have generally hovered in the range of $3.0 billion - $3.2 billion.

finance commercial export sales of agricultural commodities".4 The statute makes clear that "[e]xport credit guarantees issued pursuant to this section shall contain such terms and conditions as the Commodity Credit Corporation determines to be necessary".5
3. The United States has elsewhere noted the various discretionary elements in the operation of the programme that tamp down the actual issuance of guarantees. These include the regulatory authorities permitting non-issuance of guarantees with respect to any individual application for an export credit guarantee or to suspend the issuance of export credit guarantees under any particular allocation; limitations on commodities with respect to which guarantees may be made available, total guarantee value for individual commodities, destination, time within which export must occur, and internally established exposure limits applicable to individual bank obligors.6
4. Furthermore, and more importantly, Brazil's own approach would require a showing that the programmes mandate that the premium rates will be insufficient to cover long-term operating costs and losses of the programmes. Brazil has not made such a showing, for the simple reason that the programmes do not so mandate. The Commodity Credit Corporation ("CCC") has discretion concerning numerous aspects of any guarantees it may issue, such as the destinations, types of commodities, and length of term of the guarantee. All of these aspects could affect the question of the long-term operating costs and losses of the programmes. For example, the credit risk involved in some destinations may be less than for others. Similarly, the risk associated with a guarantee of credit extended for one year may be less than for credit extended for three years.
5. Thus, while the provisions establishing the export credit guarantee programmes are measures, they do not mandate an inconsistency with any WTO obligation. Putting aside the US argument that export credit guarantees are not subject to export subsidy disciplines by virtue of Article 10.2 of the Agreement on Agriculture until Members conclude their ongoing negotiations and agree on such disciplines, there is no basis to presume, on the basis of the law itself, that the export credit guarantee programmes provide export subsidies and threaten to lead to circumvention of US export subsidy reduction commitments.7 Because the CCC retains the discretion to issue particular guarantees and attach terms and conditions as set out above, the statute alone does not allow a presumption that premium rates will be insufficient to cover long-term operating costs and losses of the programmes. Thus, Brazil's argument that the CCC is mandated to "make available" $5.5 billion in export credit guarantees cannot alter the fact that the CCC has discretion to control the guarantees actually provided and the terms of those guarantees; as a result, no WTO inconsistency is mandated.
(e) Does the US agree that, under the Budget Enforcement Act of 1990, the Office of Management and Budget classifies the export credit guarantee programmes as "mandatory" (see Brazil's response to Panel Question 142, para. 89)? Does this exempt the programmes from the requirement to receive new Congressional budget authority before it undertakes new guarantee commitments (e.g. Exhibit BRA-117 (2 USC 661(c)(2))? USA

controlled by annual appropriations acts and the outlays that result from that budget authority. "Direct" spending (commonly referred to as "mandatory" spending)9 means budget authority and outlays resulting from permanent laws as well as "entitlement authority".10 That is, whether spending is "mandatory" for purposes of the BEA is an accounting classification issue and does not control whether a measure is "mandatory" for a mandatory / discretionary analysis for WTO purposes.
7. The Office of Management and Budget classifies the export credit guarantee programmes as "mandatory" because the "budget authority is provided by law other than appropriation Acts".11 As a result, although the export credit guarantee programmes are exempt from the ordinary requirement that budget authority be provided in advance through annual appropriations acts, they remain subject to the continuing availability of budget authority in law other than annual appropriations legislation. Of note, the Office of Management and Budget has also recognized: "While mandatory and discretionary classifications are used for measuring compliance with the BEA, they do not determine whether a programme provides legal entitlement to a payment or benefit"12 (italics added). Thus, the classification of these programmes as "mandatory" for purposes of the BEA merely means that the budget authority is not "discretionary", that is, "provided in appropriation Acts".13 This accounting classification does not alter CCC's considerable discretion in operating the programmes, as explained in more detail in the US answer to Question 257(d), and does not make the programmes "mandatory" for purposes of a mandatory/discretionary analysis.
9 See OMB Circular A-11 (2003), Section 20: Terms and Concepts (available at: http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/circulars/a11/current_year/s20.pdf).
10 This distinction between discretionary spending, mandatory direct spending and mandatory entitlement spending is reflected in the applicable statutory definitions. 2 U.S.C. Section 900(7) and 900(8) provide:
"(7) The term `discretionary appropriations' means budgetary resources (except to fund direct-spending programmes) provided in appropriation Acts.
"(8) The term `direct spending' means-- (A) budget authority provided by law other than appropriation Acts; (B) entitlement authority; and (C) the food stamp programme 11 2 U.S.C. 900(8). 12 OMB Circular A-11 (2003), Section 20.9 (emphasis added). 13 2 U.S.C. 900(7).
