UNITED STATES ­ DOMESTIC SUPPORT AND EXPORT CREDIT GUARANTEES FOR AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS
Request for the Establishment of a Panel by Brazil
The following communication, dated 8 November 2007, from the delegation of Brazil to the Chairman of the Dispute Settlement Body, is circulated pursuant to Article 6.2 of the DSU.
_______________
1. On 22 August 2007, Brazil and the United States held consultations with respect to whether the domestic support the United States provided in favour of its agricultural producers exceeded the commitment levels specified in Section I of Part IV of its Schedule, contrary to Article 3.2 of the Agreement on Agriculture. While the discussions were useful and clarified a number of issues, they did not resolve Brazil's serious concerns regarding the Current Total Aggregate Measurement of Support provided by the United States. Accordingly, my authorities have now instructed me to request the establishment of a panel.
2. Pursuant to Articles 4, 6, and 7.1 of the Understanding on Rules and Procedures Governing the Settlement of Disputes ("DSU"), Article XXIII of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994 ("GATT 1994"), and Article 19 of the Agreement on Agriculture, Brazil requests that the Dispute Settlement Body ("DSB") establish a panel with standard terms of reference to consider the following matter:
That the United States' Current Total Aggregate Measurement of Support has exceeded its commitment levels in each of the years1 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2004 and 2005, contrary to Article 3.2 of the Agreement on Agriculture.
3. Pursuant to Article 3.2 of the Agreement on Agriculture, the United States committed to limit its Total Aggregate Measurement of Support to the annual levels specified in section I of Part IV of Schedule XX of the United States: for the year 1999, USD 19,899.264 million and for each subsequent year, USD 19,103.294 million. Despite this, the United States' Current Total Aggregate Measurement of Support provided by the measures at issue, when properly calculated in accordance with the provisions of the Agreement on Agriculture, has exceeded its commitment levels in each of the years 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2004 and 2005, in violation of Article 3.2 of this agreement. These violations nullify or impair the benefits accruing to Brazil under this agreement.
4. The domestic support measures2 at issue comprise those listed in the Annex, which forms an integral part of this request. These measures include (a) domestic support measures identified by the
1 In this request, "year" has the meaning assigned to it in Article 1(i) of the Agreement on Agriculture. 2 In this request, the word "measure" refers to the support programs as well as support provided pursuant to those programs.

The measures further include any other legislation, regulations and other instruments not listed in the Annex, by which any of the support under the listed measures was provided. 5. Brazil asks that this request for the establishment of a panel be placed on the agenda of the DSB meeting scheduled for 19 November 2007.
3 The reference to domestic support measures identified in the Notifications is without prejudice to whether the amounts or categorization of such measures are accurate.
