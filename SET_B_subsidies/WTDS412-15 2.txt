CANADA ­ CERTAIN MEASURES AFFECTING THE RENEWABLE ENERGY GENERATION SECTOR
CANADA ­ MEASURES RELATING TO THE FEED-IN TARIFF PROGRAM
COMMUNICATION FROM CANADA
The following communication, dated 20 June 2013, from the delegation of Canada to the Chairperson of the Dispute Settlement Body, is circulated at the request of that delegation.
_______________
At its meeting on 24 May 2013, the Dispute Settlement Body ("DSB") adopted recommendations and rulings in the disputes Canada -- Certain Measures Affecting the Renewable Energy Generation Sector (DS412) and Canada -- Measures Relating to the Feed-in Tariff Program (DS426). Further to Article 21.3 of the Understanding on Rules and Procedures Governing the Settlement of Disputes ("DSU"), my authorities have instructed me to advise the DSB of Canada's intentions with respect to implementation of the recommendations and rulings of the DSB. Japan and the European Union have agreed that Canada will inform the DSB of its intentions by this letter rather than by calling a special meeting of the DSB solely for this purpose.
It is Canada's intention to implement the recommendations and rulings of the DSB in these disputes in a manner that respects its WTO obligations. We are advised by the Government of Ontario that they are developing options to implement the appropriate compliance measures, including the necessary legislative steps, to ensure that their FIT program is brought into compliance with these rulings. These compliance measures will require a reasonable period of time to implement. Canada stands ready to discuss this matter with Japan and the European Union, in accordance with Article 21.3(b) of the DSU.
I respectfully request that you circulate this communication to Members of the DSB.
