Communication from Brazil
The following communication, dated 20 January 1997, from the Permanent Mission of Brazil to the Permanent Mission of the United States and the Dispute Settlement Body, is circulated at the request of the Permanent Mission of Brazil.
_______________
With reference to your letter dated 10 January 1997, in which the United States requests consultations with the Government of Brazil regarding certain measures on the automotive sector, I hereby inform you that, in accordance with Article 4.2 of the DSU, the Government of Brazil is ready to afford adequate opportunity for such consultations, in the understanding that the general rules and procedures of the DSU are applicable to this request.
In accepting to hold consultations with the United States on the above-referred issue, the Government of Brazil wishes to underscore the provisions in Article 3, paragraphs 7 and 10 of the DSU, relating to the preference to be given to mutually acceptable solutions and to the non-contentious character of the procedures contained in the DSU. The Government of Brazil also wishes to state that the holding of consultations with the United States does not, in any way, imply acceptance, by the Government of Brazil, of the alleged violations of provisions cited in the request for consultations contained in your letter dated 10 January 1997.
The Government of Brazil suggests that the consultations be held in the latter part of the week beginning on 27 January 1997, in Geneva.
