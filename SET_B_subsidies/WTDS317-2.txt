UNITED STATES ­ MEASURES AFFECTING TRADE IN LARGE CIVIL AIRCRAFT
Request for the Establishment of a Panel by the European Communities
The following communication, dated 31 May 2005, from the delegation of the European Communities to the Chairman of the Dispute Settlement Body, is circulated pursuant to Article 6.2 of the DSU.
_______________
On 6 October 2004, the European Communities requested consultations with the United States pursuant to Articles 4.1, 7.1, and 30 of the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures ("SCM Agreement"), Article XXIII:1 of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994 ("GATT 1994"), and Article 4 of the Understanding on Rules and Procedures Governing the Settlement of Disputes ("DSU") with regard to measures affecting trade in large civil aircraft. This request was circulated to the WTO Members on 12 October 2004 as document WT/DS317/1, "United States ­ Measures Affecting Trade in Large Civil Aircraft."
Consultations were held on 5 November 2004 with a view to reaching a mutually satisfactory solution. By letter of 21 December 2004, the European Communities in the framework of the requested consultations submitted supplementary questions and asked for further consultations, but the United States declined to do so.
The European Communities requests that a panel be established pursuant to Article 6 of the DSU; Article XXIII:2 of the GATT 1994; and Articles 4, 7, and 30 of the SCM Agreement (to the extent that Article 30 incorporates by reference Article XXIII of the GATT 1994).
This dispute concerns prohibited and actionable subsidies provided to and benefiting the US producers of large civil aircraft1 (the "US LCA industry"), including, in particular, the Boeing Company ("Boeing") and McDonnell Douglas Corporation prior to its merger with Boeing. The measures are currently reflected in and derive from the following:

1 In accordance with the 1992 Agreement between the European Communities and the Government of the United States of America concerning the application of the GATT Agreement on Trade in Civil Aircraft on trade in large civil aircraft, large civil aircraft ("LCA") includes all aircraft as defined in Article 1 of the GATT Agreement on Trade in Civil Aircraft, except engines as defined in Article 1.1(b) thereof, that are designed for passenger or cargo transportation and have 100 or more passenger seats or its equivalent in cargo configuration. Boeing produces or markets the following families of LCA: 717, 737, 747, 757, 767, 777, and 787.

b. FSC Repeal and Extraterritorial Income Exclusion Act of 2000, Pub. L. No. 106519; and
c. American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, Pub. L. No. 108-357.
******* The European Communities considers that the above measures are inconsistent with the obligations of the United States under the following provisions:
(1) Articles 3.1(a), 3.1(b) and 3.2 of the SCM Agreement;
(2) Article 5(a) of the SCM Agreement;
(3) Articles 5(c), 6.3(a), (b), and (c) of the SCM Agreement.
(4) Article III:4 of the GATT 1994.
The European Communities is of the view that the above measures, reflected in the U.S., state, and local statutes, regulations, administrative procedures, and other programmes and policies as listed above, including any relevant subsequent amendments thereof or successory acts, are inconsistent with these provisions as such and as applied.
The measures listed above are subsidies because in each instance there is a financial contribution by the US, state or local government, and a benefit is thereby conferred within the meaning of Article 1.1(a)(1) and (b) of the SCM Agreement. They benefit and will continue to benefit in the future the production, sale, and export of each of the individual subsidised LCA products of the US LCA industry. Each of the listed subsidies is specific to the US LCA industry within the meaning of Article 2 of the SCM Agreement.
The subsidies listed above are de jure or de facto export contingent, and contingent on the use of domestic over imported goods.
The use of these measures causes adverse effects ­ i.e., material injury or threat of material injury to the European Community LCA industry ­ and serious prejudice including threat of serious prejudice to the interests of the European Communities within the meaning of Article 5(a) and (c) of the SCM Agreement, because, inter alia:
­ The effect of the measures is material injury, or a threat thereof, in violation of Article 5(a) of the SCM Agreement;
­ The effect of the measures in benefiting the subsidised products is a significant price undercutting by subsidised products of the US LCA industry as compared with the price of competing European Community LCA products in the world, European Community, US, and third country markets where US and Community producers compete, or a threat thereof, in violation of Articles 5(c) and 6.3(c) of the SCM Agreement;
­ The effect of the measures in benefiting the subsidised products is significant depression and suppression of the prices of competing European Community LCA products in the world, European Community, US, and third country markets where US and Community producers compete, or a threat thereof, in violation of Articles 5(c) and 6.3(c) of the SCM Agreement;

WT/DS317/2 Page 12
­ The effect of the measures in benefiting the subsidised products is significant lost sales of competing European Community LCA products in the world, European Community, U.S., and third country markets where US and Community producers compete, or a threat thereof, in violation of Articles 5(c) and 6.3(c) of the SCM Agreement;
­ The effect of the measures in benefiting the subsidised products is to displace or impede exports of competing European Community LCA products in the US market, or a threat thereof, in violation of Articles 5(c) and 6.3(a) of the SCM Agreement;
­ The effect of the measures in benefiting the subsidised products is to displace or impede exports of competing European Community LCA products in third country markets, or a threat thereof, in violation of Articles 5(c) and 6.3(b) of the SCM Agreement.
The above measures are neither justified under any provision of a covered agreement, including the Agreement on Trade in Civil Aircraft, nor under the 1992 Agreement between the European Communities and the Government of the United States of America concerning the application of the GATT Agreement on Trade in Civil Aircraft on trade in large civil aircraft.
The European Communities requests that a panel be established with standard terms of reference, in accordance with Articles 4.4 and 7.4 of the SCM Agreement and Article 7 of the DSU.
The European Communities asks that this request for the establishment of a panel be placed on the agenda for the next meeting of the Dispute Settlement Body, which is scheduled to take place on 13 June 2005.
The European Communities further requests that the DSB, together with the establishment of the panel, initiate the procedures provided in Annex V of the SCM Agreement pursuant to paragraph 2 of that Annex. In particular, the European Communities requests that the DSB designate a representative to serve the function of facilitating the informationgathering process of Annex V. The European Communities will seek to agree on the name of a representative of the DSB with the United States and failing agreement will propose a name to the DSB.
The European Communities would like to indicate, in conformity with paragraphs 1 and 3 of Annex V, that the market considered relevant by the European Communities is a world market. In order to obtain sufficiently representative data to resolve this dispute while at the same time avoiding unnecessary burdens on other WTO Members, the European Communities intends to address questions under the Annex V procedure to the United States and the following third-country Members:
Argentina, Australia, Bahrain, Brazil, Brunei, Cameroon, Canada, Chile, China, Colombia, Egypt, El Salvador, Fiji, Hong Kong, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Israel, Japan, Jordan, Kenya, Kuwait, Madagascar, Malaysia, Mauritania, Mexico, Mongolia, Morocco, Namibia, New Zealand, Norway, Oman, Pakistan, Panama, Peru, Philippines, Romania, Senegal, Singapore, South Africa, South Korea, Switzerland, Chinese Taipei, Thailand, Trinidad and Tobago, Tunisia, Turkey, United Arab Emirates, and Venezuela.
