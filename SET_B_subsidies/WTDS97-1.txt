UNITED STATES - COUNTERVAILING DUTY INVESTIGATION OF IMPORTS OF SALMON FROM CHILE
Request for Consultations by Chile
The following communication, dated 5 August 1997, from the Permanent Mission of Chile to the Permanent Mission of the United States and to the Dispute Settlement Body, is circulated in accordance with Article 4.4 of the DSU.
______________
By the present Note, Chile requests the holding of consultations with the United States pursuant to Article XXII.1 of the GATT 1994 and Article 4 of the Understanding on Rules and Procedures Governing the Settlement of Disputes, inter alia, in connection with the subsidies investigation initiated by the United States Department of Commerce against imports of salmon from Chile.
In the opinion of the Government of Chile, the decision by the Department of Commerce to initiate a subsidies investigation was taken in the absence of sufficient evidence concerning the subsidies investigated and the injury they cause, contrary to the provisions of Article 11.2 and 11.3 of the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures.
Moreover, its decision is not consistent with Article 11.4 of the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures in relation to the representative status of producers of salmon fillets.
The Government of Chile reserves the right to include other measures and decisions by the United States investigating authorities.
Chile would appreciate the setting of a mutually convenient date, during the first two weeks of September, for the holding of these consultations.
