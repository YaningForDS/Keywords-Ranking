The EU considers that the above-mentioned measures are inconsistent, among others, with Canada's obligations under the following provisions:
 Articles 3(1)(b) and 3(2) of the SCM Agreement, because the measures are deemed to be subsidies within the meaning of Article 1.1 of the SCM Agreement that are prohibited insofar they are provided contingent upon the use of domestic over imported goods, namely contingent upon the use of equipment for renewable energy generation facilities produced in Ontario over such equipment imported from other WTO Members, including the EU;
 Article III:4 of the GATT 1994, because the measures accord less favourable treatment to imported equipment for renewable energy generation facilities over like products originating in Ontario; and
 Article 2.1 of the TRIMs Agreement, in conjunction with paragraph 1(a) of the Agreement's Illustrative List, because the measures are trade-related investment measures inconsistent with Article III:4 of the GATT 1994 which require the purchase or use by enterprises of equipment for renewable energy generation facilities of Ontario origin.
The European Union reserves the right to address additional measures and claims under other provisions of the WTO Agreement regarding the above matters during the course of the consultations.
The European Union looks forward to receiving in due course a reply from Canada to this request. The European Union is ready to consider with Canada mutually convenient dates to hold consultations in Geneva.
