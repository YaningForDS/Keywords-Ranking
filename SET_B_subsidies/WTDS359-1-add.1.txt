CHINA ­ CERTAIN MEASURES GRANTING REFUNDS, REDUCTIONS OR EXEMPTIONS FROM TAXES AND OTHER PAYMENTS
Request for Further Consultations by Mexico
Addendum
The following communication, dated 4 May 2007, from the delegation of Mexico to the delegation of China and to the Chairman of the Dispute Settlement Body, is circulated in accordance with Article 4.4 of the DSU.
_______________
As you know, on 20 March 2007, pursuant to the request by Mexico (DS359/1), the People's Republic of China and Mexico held consultations regarding certain measures through which the People's Republic of China grants enterprises located within its territory refunds, reductions, or exemptions from taxes or other payments otherwise due to the Government. On the basis of those consultations, held pursuant to Articles 1 and 4 of the Understanding on Rules and Procedures Governing the Settlement of Disputes (DSU), Article XXII:1 of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994 (GATT 1994), Articles 4 and 30 of the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures (SCM Agreement), and Article 8 of the Agreement on Trade-Related Investment Measures (TRIMs Agreement), and following a subsequent review, we understand that China has repealed a subsidy program based on the disbursement of loans at discounted lending rates, identified in our initial consultation request as the Circular of the People's Bank of China, the State Administration of Foreign Exchange, the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation and the State Administration of Taxation Concerning Printing and Distribution Detailed Rules on Rewarding and Punishment Concerning Provisional Regulations over Examination of Export Collections of Foreign Exchange.
In addition, regarding the Income Tax Law of the People's Republic of China on Enterprises with Foreign Investment and Foreign Enterprises, also identified in our initial consultation request, we have learned that China recently adopted a new income tax law, the Enterprise Income Tax Law of the People's Republic of China.
To take these developments into account, my authorities have instructed me to modify our identification of the measures at issue and request supplemental consultations with the Government of the People's Republic of China pursuant to Articles 1 and 4 of the DSU, Article XXII:1 of the GATT 1994, Articles 4 and 30 of the SCM Agreement, and Article 8 of the TRIMs Agreement, regarding certain measures through which the People's Republic of China grants enterprises located within its

· Rules for Implementation of the Income Tax Law of the People's Republic of China on Enterprises with Foreign Investment and Foreign Enterprises11, including Article 81 thereof, read in conjunction with the Income Tax Law of the People's Republic of China on Enterprises with Foreign Investment and Foreign Enterprises12, including Articles 6 and 10 thereof, and the Provisions of the State Council on the Encouragement of Foreign Investment13, including Article 10 thereof;

These measures appear to provide refunds, reductions or exemptions to enterprises in China on the condition that those enterprises purchase domestic over imported goods, or on the condition that they meet certain export performance criteria. Thus, the said measures appear to be inconsistent with Article 3 of the SCM Agreement. Furthermore, to the extent the measures accord imported products treatment less favourable than that accorded "like" domestic products, they appear inconsistent with Article III:4 of the GATT 1994 and Article 2 of the TRIMs Agreement. The measures also include preferential treatment for enterprises with foreign investment and foreign enterprises established in economic areas in the territory of China (for example, in special economic zones, economic and technological zones, coastal economic open zones, and the Hainan Special Economic Zone) to the extent that they grant enterprises located within the said areas refunds, reductions, or exemptions from taxes or other payments in a manner inconsistent with the abovementioned WTO provisions. Finally, the measures also appear not to comply with China's obligations under paragraphs 7.2-7.3 and 10.3 of Part I of its WTO Accession Protocol18, as well as paragraph 1.2 of Part I of its Accession Protocol (to the extent that it incorporates paragraphs 167 and 203 of the Report of the Working Party on the Accession of China19), which forms part of the terms of accession agreed between China and the WTO and is an integral part of the Marrakesh Agreement Establishing the World Trade Organization.
We look forward to receiving your reply to the present request in order to fix a mutually convenient date for consultations.
