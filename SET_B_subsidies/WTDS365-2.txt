UNITED STATES ­ DOMESTIC SUPPORT AND EXPORT CREDIT GUARANTEES FOR AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS
Request to Join Consultations
Communication from Canada
The following communication, dated 20 July 2007, from the delegation of Canada to the delegation of the United States, the delegation of Brazil and to the Chairman of the Dispute Settlement Body, is circulated in accordance with Article 4.11 of the DSU.
_______________
Pursuant to Article 4.11 of the Understanding on Rules and Procedures Governing the Settlement of Disputes (DSU), the Government of Canada hereby notifies its desire to be joined in the consultations requested by Brazil pursuant to Articles 1 and 4 of the DSU, Article XXII:1 of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994, Articles 4 and 30 of the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures, and Article 19 of the Agreement on Agriculture, with regard to domestic support and export credit guarantees for agricultural products provided by the United States.
The relevant communication to the Permanent Mission of the United States of America from the Permanent Mission of Brazil, dated 11 July 2007, was circulated to WTO Members on 17 July 2007 as United States - Domestic Support and Export Credit Guarantees for Agricultural Products (WT/DS365/1, G/L/823, G/SCM/D76/1, G/AG/GEN/75).
Canada's agricultural sector is vital to its economy. Canada is concerned by the impact on its agricultural producers of the measures identified by Brazil in its request for consultations and has in fact requested the establishment of a panel in United States ­ Subsidies and Other Domestic Support for Corn and Other Agricultural Products (WT/DS357), with respect to such measures. Canada has, therefore, a substantial trade interest in these consultations.
