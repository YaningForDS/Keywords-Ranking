The European Communities submits this report in accordance with Article 21.6 of the Understanding on Rules and Procedures Governing the Settlement of Disputes (the "DSU").
On 3 August 2005, the Dispute Settlement Body (the "DSB") adopted the Panel Report in European Communities ­Countervailing Measures on Dynamic Random Access Memory Chips from Korea. At the DSB meeting of 31 August 2005, the European Communities confirmed its intention to implement the recommendations and rulings of the DSB in this dispute and stated that it would require a reasonable period of time in which to do so, pursuant to Article 21.3 of the DSU.
On 12 October 2005, the parties notified the DSB that pursuant to Article 21.3(b) of the DSU they had agreed that the reasonable period of time for the European Communities to implement the recommendations and rulings of the DSB in this dispute would be 8 months and would therefore expire on 3 April 2006.
On 8 March 2006, the European Commission proposed to the Council a regulation to amend Regulation (EC) No 1480/2003 imposing a countervailing duty on DRAMs from Korea and thus implement the recommendations and rulings of the DSB. This proposal was adopted by the Council on 10 April 2006.
