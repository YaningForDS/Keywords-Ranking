A. REQUEST FOR PRELIMINARY RULINGS
122. Does Brazil allege that cottonseed payments, interest subsidies and storage payments are included in the subsidies that cause serious prejudice? Do they appear in the economic calculations? BRA
Brazil's Answer:
1. Cottonseed payments, interest subsidies and storage payments are included in the set of subsidies that Brazil alleges cause serious prejudice to its interests within the meaning of Articles 5(c) and 6.3 of the SCM Agreement and Article XVI of GATT 1994. The amounts of cottonseed payments and interest subsidies/storage payments range from $50 million to $216 million per year.1 To appreciate the size of these subsidies, the annual amount of each of them separately far exceeds the total amount of Brazilian assistance to its upland cotton farmers of $10 million in MY 2001 by a factor of 4 to 21.2 Indeed, the annual, individual amount of US cottonseed payments, interest subsidies and storage payments also by far exceeds the amounts of subsidies paid by most other cotton-producing countries.
2. The United States has notified cottonseed payments as trade-distorting amber box subsidies to the WTO.3 Thus, these payments are presumed to be trade-distortive. Interest subsidies and storage payments appear to be part of the operation of the marketing loan programme that has also been notified to the WTO as a trade-distortive amber box subsidy, and is therefore presumed to be tradedistortive. The United States has not notified them separately to the WTO.4
3. The economic calculations provided by Brazil on the effect of US subsidies in filling the cost revenue gap include cottonseed payments and interest subsidies/storage payments.5 They are also included as part of the overall level of US subsidization provided. However, they are not part of the econometric model developed by Professor Daniel Sumner.6
123. Does Brazil's request for the establishment of the Panel name the statute authorizing cottonseed payments for the 1999 crop? BRA
Brazil's Answer:
4. To the extent that cottonseed payments for the MY 1999 crop were authorized by Section 204(e) of the Agricultural Risk Protection Act of 2000, Brazil's request for the establishment of the Panel names the statute authorizing these payments.7 This act authorized the payment of $100 million in cottonseed payments. However, Brazil did not explicitly identify in its request for establishment P.L. 106-113, which serves as the legal basis for a further $79 million in cottonseed payments for the MY 1999 cottonseed payments.
1 Brazil's 9 September Further Submission, Table 1, p. 4. 2 Exhibit Bra-284 ("Production and Trade Policies Affecting the Cotton Industry," ICAC, September 2003, p. 6). 3 Exhibit Bra-47 (G/AG/N/USA/43, p. 20). 4 Exhibit Bra-47 (G/AG/N/USA/43, p. 20). 5 Brazil's 22 August Rebuttal Submission, para. 30 and 40. 6 To the extent that interest subsidies and storage payments operate to compensate for any cost incurred by US upland cotton producers from the participation in the marketing loan program (for instance, for the storage cost resulting from storing physical upland cotton as collateral for the marketing loan), these subsidies have been considered in Professor Sumner's model. However, those costs do not occur, if a producer decides to opt for a loan deficiency payment rather then taking out a marketing loan. 7 WT/DS267/7, p. 2.

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-175
5. Brazil emphasizes that it is not challenging the underlying statutes authorizing the payment of cottonseed payments in MY 1999, 2000 and 2002, i.e., Brazil does not challenge those payments per se. Brazil challenges as "measures" the payments of those subsidies as causing adverse effects to its interests. The United States and Brazil have consulted about those payments.8 Brazil properly included reference to all "payments" for upland cotton in its request for the establishment of the Panel.9 This is sufficient to properly identify cottonseed payments as measures for the purposes of Brazil's request for the establishment of the Panel.
B. EXEMPTION FROM ACTIONS
6. According to its revised timetable, the Panel will issue its report to the parties after the end of the 2003 calendar year. Does this have any impact on "exempt[ion] from actions" under Article 13(b)(ii) and 13(c)(ii) of the Agreement on Agriculture? BRA, US
Brazil's Answer:
6. No. Brazil's claims relate to prohibited and actionable subsidies provided during MY 19992002 when the United States had no peace clause protection. Brazil's threat of serious prejudice claims relate to the present threat of serious prejudice caused by subsidies provided during MY 19992002, as well as the threat caused by subsidies that are required to be provided through the end of MY 2007 by the 2002 FSRI Act and the 2000 ARP Act. The fact that the Panel will issue its determination regarding these subsidies after the termination of the "peace clause" in 2004 has no impact on the analysis of these claims.
C. IDENTIFICATION OF THE SUBSIDIZED PRODUCT
125.
(2) Brazil has submitted that "The record suggests that historic producers are current producers." It points to factors including the specialization of upland cotton producers, the need to recoup expensive investments in cotton-specific equipment, and the geographic focus and climatic requirements of upland cotton production in the "cotton belt". (Brazil's rebuttal submission, footnote 98, on page 24)
(a) Regarding the specialization of upland cotton producers and the geographic focus of upland cotton production, how does Brazil take account of the fact that cotton is produced in 17 of the 50 states of the United States and that average cotton area is approximately 38% of a cotton farm's acres? (This information is taken from the US's response to question 67bis, footnote 35). BRA
8 Exhibit Bra-101 (Questions for the Purposes of the Consultations, Questions 14.1 et seq., p. 13). 9 The "measures" identified include (1) "domestic support subsidies provided to the US upland cotton industry during marketing years 1999-2001", (2) "domestic support subsidies that are mandated to be provided to the US upland cotton industry during marketing years 2002-2007", (3) "all subsidies benefiting upland cotton that have trade distorting effects or effects on production by the US upland cotton industry", (4) "domestic support, and all other subsidies provided under regulations, administrative procedures . . . for the production, use and/or export of US upland cotton and upland cotton products". WT/DS267/7, pages 1, 2, 3.

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-176
Brazil's Answer:
7. In contrast to the information cited in the Panel's question, more relevant information concerning specialization of cotton producers in cotton farms is set out in Exhibit Bra-16, which is a 2001 USDA report on the cost of production of cotton farms. That report contains the following figure:10

8. This evidence shows that farms with 500 or more acres of upland cotton are heavily specialized in the production of cotton. While these farms represented 33 per cent of US farms producing upland cotton, they produced 75 per cent of total US upland cotton in MY 1997.11 Thus, the great majority of US production of upland cotton takes place on farms that largely specialize in the production of upland cotton.
9. Other data regarding specialization is found in a 1998 USDA report indicating that most smaller farms ­ defined as farms with income below $250,000 and which account for 92 per cent of all US farms ­ tend to produce only one or at most two crops.12 This is illustrated in the chart below:

p. 9). p. 7).

10 Exhibit Bra-16 ("Characteristics and Production Costs of US Cotton Farms", USDA, October 2001, 11 Exhibit Bra-16 ("Characteristics and Production Costs of US Cotton Farms". USDA, October 2001, 12 Exhibit Bra-285 ("Agriculture Fact Book 2001-2002", Chapter 3 - American Farms, p. 32).

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-177
10. Approximately 55 per cent of upland cotton is produced on such smaller farms.13 Thus, even for those smaller farms producing upland cotton, the evidence suggests that over 50 per cent produce mainly upland cotton and the rest produce at most one additional crop. This evidence is consistent with Brazil's argument concerning cotton specialization. 11. With respect to the Panel's question, the 38 per cent figure cited by the United States refers to "planted cotton acreage" as a percentage of "total acreage operated".14 The United States provides no information on what "total acreage operated" means. Nor does the United States provide the Panel with the amount of "planted cotton acreage" as a percentage of "total PFC/DP base acreage". It may be that the cotton acreage accounts for most of a farm's "base acreage". Thus, the "total acreage operated" is not the appropriate basis to calculate a percentage of base acreage for farms producing upland cotton. The best evidence of specialization is the actual payments made to upland cotton producers discussed in Brazil's Answer to Question 125 (5). The next best evidence is the USDA data on specialization of cotton farms cited above. 12. Moreover, Brazil's arguments are not dependent on proof that the majority of cotton farms produce only upland cotton. The evidence suggests that larger farms tend to grow at least some other crops and, therefore, may have more than one type of PFC/market loss assistance or direct and counter-cyclical payment "base acreage".15 As Christopher Ward testified, farmers rotate the production of several different crops, planting one crop on a certain portion of the farmland, and then
13 Exhibit Bra-16 ("Characteristics and Production Costs of US Cotton Farms," USDA, October 2001, Table 7) tabulating farms with value of production less than $250,000.
14 Exhibit Bra-16 ("Characteristics and Production Costs of US Cotton Farms," USDA, October 2001, Table 3).
15 This is also demonstrated by Exhibit Bra-286 (Direct and Counter-cyclical Program Contract, Form CCC-509, USDA, Commodity Credit Corporation), which provides for the possibility to establish base acres for different crops.

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-178
moving the production of that same crop to another portion of the farmland.16 But the fact that crops are rotated or that some farmers have multiple types of "base acres" and produce more than one crop on their farm does not mean that farmers do not continue to plant upland cotton and use cottonspecific machinery and ginning facilities. This is confirmed by the fact that between MY 1999-2002, there were no wide swings in planted upland cotton acreage.17 13. Finally, while the United States is correct in stating that upland cotton is produced in 17 states, 66 per cent of upland cotton is produced in only 5 states, and 90 per cent is produced in only 10 out of the 50 US states.18 In addition, even within each of these 10 states, upland cotton tends to be grown in relatively distinct geographical regions. This is shown in the graph below:19
(c) Regarding the high cost of upland cotton production, can Brazil show that farms who planted upland cotton could only have covered their costs by receiving upland cotton, rice or peanut payments in every year from 1999 through 2002? BRA
Brazil's Answer: 14. Between MY 2000-2002, US upland cotton producers could not make a profit, unless they grew upland cotton on upland cotton or rice (or peanut in MY 2002) base acreage. Brazil provides data below for each of the four marketing years covering the period of investigation (MY 1999-2002). This evidence is consistent with a conclusion that the great majority of upland cotton was produced on upland cotton base acreage. In responding to this question from the Panel, Brazil took into account

Dr. Glauber's comment that Step 2 payments are not received by US upland cotton producers but rather by exporters and domestic users.20 Brazil generally agrees with this statement. Therefore, Brazil has excluded Step 2 payments from the pool of revenue received by US upland cotton producers.21 It presents data on the total amount of market revenue for upland cotton lint and seed, marketing loan benefits, crop insurance payments, cottonseed payments, so-called "other payments"22 and PFC, market loss assistance, direct and counter-cyclical payments.

16. The chart shows that US upland cotton producers received total revenue of 91.54 cents per
pound of upland cotton produced. At the same time, the average cost of production was 82.03 cents per pound in MY 199924 and prices received by producers were 45 cents per pound.25 It follows that
US producers could not produce upland cotton without the financial assistance of the US Government
in the form of large amounts of subsidies. US producers needed 4.46 cents per pound from the total
combined upland cotton PFC and market loss assistance payment of 13.97 cents per pound to recover their costs.26

20 Exhibit US-24, p. 3 fifth and sixth paragraph. 21 This does not affect Brazil's view that Step 2 payments are properly included in the peace clause
analysis under Article 13(b)(ii) of the Agreement on Agriculture as "support to upland cotton". While Step 2
payments may not directly benefit domestic producers of upland cotton, they do so indirectly. As they increase
demand for US upland cotton, they increase prices received by US producers and are, therefore, properly
described as "support to upland cotton". 22 Interest subsidies and storage payments. 23 See Exhibit Bra-287 (Market Revenue and US Government Payment to US Upland Cotton
Producers). 24 Exhibit Bra-205 (Costs and Revenues of US Upland Cotton Producers). 25 Exhibit Bra-4 ("Fact Sheet: Upland Cotton," USDA, January 2003, p. 5). 26 Thus, they could have produced upland cotton on wheat, corn, grain sorghum, cotton and rice base
acreage without suffering a loss.

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-180

17. In MY 2000, the financial situation of US upland cotton producers worsened. While the price they received for upland cotton lint increased to 49.8 cents per pound27, their total revenue fell to 84.74 cents per pound28, only slightly above their average cost of production of 82.69 cents per pound.

18. Again, large amounts of US subsidies were instrumental in closing the gap between the US cost of production and the market returns of producers. For MY 2000, the 13.86 cents per pound in upland cotton PFC and market loss assistance payments as well as all other subsidies were needed to close the gap between the cost of production and the market returns.29 Average US upland cotton producers could also have covered their total costs had they planted upland cotton on rice base acres. But they would have suffered a marginal loss on corn or other crop base acres.
19. The results for MY 2001 show a similar result:

27 Exhibit Bra-4 ("Fact Sheet: Upland Cotton", USDA, January 2003, p. 5). 28 See Exhibit Bra-287 (Market Revenue and US Government Payment to US Upland Cotton

20. US producers received a total revenue of 79.41 cents per pound,30 only 29.8 cents per pound of which was market revenue for upland cotton lint. At the same time, they faced an average cost of production of 76.44 cents per pound.31 Thus, the average US producer of upland cotton needed an upland cotton or rice PFC and market loss assistance payment to break even, while upland cotton production on corn or any other crop base acreage would have generated a loss.
21. For MY 2002, average US producers even suffered a loss from upland cotton production on upland cotton base acres32, let alone corn or other crop base acres, except for rice and peanuts.33 The average US upland cotton producer received total revenues of 82.96 cents per pound34, while their average total cost for MY 2002 was 83.59 cents per pound.35
30 See Exhibit Bra-287 (Market Revenue and US Government Payment to US Upland Cotton Producers).
31 Exhibit Bra-205 (Costs and Revenues of US Upland Cotton Producers). 32 Brazil notes that it is not in a position to quantify the effect of the yield update for purposes of the counter-cyclical payments and, thus, likely underestimated the amount of those payments (See Brazil's Answer to Questions 125 (8)). With slightly higher counter-cyclical payments than assumed by Brazil, US producers of upland cotton might have made a small profit in MY 2002. 33 Brazil notes that while evidently some former corn producers had shifted to upland cotton production, the fact that they were allowed to update their base acres to upland cotton base acres meant that they could now receive upland cotton payments (See Brazil's Answer to Question 125 (7)). 34 See Exhibit Bra-287 (Market Revenue and US Government Payment to US Upland Cotton Producers). 35 Exhibit Bra-205 (Costs and Revenues of US Upland Cotton Producers).

22. The overall conclusion of this analysis is that, on average over the period of investigation, US upland cotton producers needed and received upland cotton or rice programme payments to cover (or almost cover) their total cost of production. At the same time, as total revenue decreased relative to the cost of production, US upland cotton acreage increased between MY 1999-2001.36 Because upland cotton producers with non-upland cotton or rice base acreage would have lost money (even with the subsidies), they would have been forced to switch out of upland cotton production. This means that the only producers that could remain were those with upland cotton or rice base. The fact that upland cotton acreage increased through MY 2001 suggests that only a small portion of upland cotton in the United States could have been grown on non-upland cotton base acres.
23. Similarly, in MY 2002, the option to update the base acreage (and yield for the CCP payment programme) allowed those producers that produced on non-upland cotton base acres in MY 19982001 to receive the considerably higher upland cotton payments under the 2002 FSRI Act. Because it is not economically sustainable to grow upland cotton on non-upland cotton (-rice or -peanut) base, the ability to update suggests that by MY 2002 nearly all US producers grew on upland cotton base.
24. Moreover, the data above indicates that even with subsidies, the average US producers did not earn any or, at most, a small profit during MY 1999-2002. As Christopher Ward testified, there is a strong need to generate profits to stay in the upland cotton business.37 These profits pay for investments in new machinery and technologies, as well as for losses incurred in years with low prices. But even with large subsidies, US producers only met their costs. Without subsidies, they were not even able to meet their variable cost in MY 2001.
25. In sum, during most of the period of investigation, US producers of upland cotton needed the high upland cotton payments from the PFC, market loss assistance, direct and counter-cyclical payment programmes to generate sustainable returns (MY 1999), simply break even (MY 2000-
36 Exhibit Bra-4 ("Fact Sheet: Upland Cotton," USDA, January 2003, p. 4). See also Brazil's Answer to Question 125 (6).
37 Exhibit Bra-283 (Statement of Christopher Ward ­ 7 October 2003, para. 10).

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-183
2001), or almost meet their total costs (MY 2002). It is, therefore, reasonable to assume that the great majority of US upland cotton was grown on upland cotton base acres.
(3) In calculating the amount of PFC, MLA, direct and counter-cyclical payments that went on upland cotton, Brazil made an adjustment for the ratio of current acreage to base acreage (see its answer to question 67, footnotes 2, 3, 4 and 5). Is this an appropriate adjustment for the particular factors referred to above? Why or why not? BRA, US
Brazil's Answer:
26. Brazil refers the Panel to its answers to Question 125 (8), Question 125(2)(a), and to Question 125(2)(c) for Brazil's arguments why its methodology is reasonable to use in the absence of direct evidence collected and controlled exclusively by the United States concerning the amount of those payments to upland cotton producers.38 In the absence of such direct evidence, Brazil has set forth39 extensive circumstantial evidence that US producers of upland cotton received such payments.40
(4) Dr. Glauber has alleged that there are statistical problems in comparing planted acres to programme acres because of abandonment of crops and also because planted acres are only survey estimates, not reported figures (See Exhibit US-24, the first full paragraph in P2). Would it be more appropriate to divide harvested acreage by base acreage? What margin of error is there between the survey estimates and reported figures? BRA, US
Brazil's Answer:
27. The appropriate figures to use for farmers' decisions on upland cotton acreage are the official USDA figures for acres planted to upland cotton. Dr. Glauber discussed certain programme and statistical issues that may have applied in the early 1990s, but which ­ with the termination of the deficiency payment programme from MY 1996 on ­ are no longer relevant.41
28. The planted acre figures used by Brazil are the only official USDA data for planted acres of crops. These data are reported by the Farm Service Agency (FSA) in its Fact Sheet on Upland Cotton.42 Planted acres reflect the choice by farmers to commit land to upland cotton production by cultivating, fertilizing, seeding and applying other inputs during the pre-planting and planting period. In some parts of the United States, variable weather and other conditions mean that some land that has been planted to upland cotton, or to some other crops, is not harvested. But, there is no question that this land was committed at the time of planting to upland cotton production. Further, once the planting takes place, that decision generally precludes further upland cotton production (or other crops) for that marketing year.
29. According to USDA's National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS), the procedure for measuring and reporting planted acres for upland cotton and other crops starts with a June survey of planted acres for each crop, which is well after planting commitments for upland cotton have been made early in spring. The June planted acre figures are updated in NASS files each month as additional data becomes available. Revisions in the figures on planted acres are determined in December and reported in the Crop Production report each year. These data include revisions based

on FSA's certified acreage information. As Exhibit Bra-288 makes clear, NASS reported the 2003 revisions using FSA information in the October Crop Production report, rather than waiting until December.43
(5) Do the acreage reports under section 1105(c) of the FSRI Act of 2002 indicate or assist in determining the number or proportion of acres of upland cotton planted on upland cotton base acres? Was there an acreage reporting requirement for upland cotton during MY1996 through 2002? BRA, US
Brazil's Answer:
30. The short answer to both of the Panel's questions is "yes". Regrettably, the United States has refused to provide Brazil or the Panel with the number or proportion of acres of upland cotton planted on upland cotton base acres for MY 1999-2002, despite Brazil's repeated efforts to obtain this information over the past year and despite the Panel's Question 67bis, in which the United States claimed incorrectly that it did not have access to this information.44
31. As implemented, Section 1105(c) of the 2002 FSRI Act requires any recipient of direct and counter-cyclical payments to submit, as a condition of eligibility of receiving the payments, "annual acreage reports with respect to all cropland on the farm".45 This means that the precise acreage for each crop grown on the farm must be tabulated and identified in an annual report. Depending on the state and the county, these acreage reports are generally due by the middle of each calendar year.46
32. In addition to the annual acreage reports, the 2002 FSRI Act required all farms eligible for direct and counter-cyclical payments to file application forms establishing and proving their historic production of the 10 programme crops.47 The required information includes the types, amount, and yields of all direct and counter-cyclical payment base acreages during the period 1998-2001 or reference to the earlier PFC base acreage. All of these applications were due no later than 1 June each year.48 USDA reported in July 2003 that 99.6 per cent of eligible farms had completed the required applications and signed up for the direct and counter-cyclical programme.49 Farms submitting both the annual programme acreage reports and the historic base-acreage application form were required to provide a specific farm identification number. This farm "ID" would appear to permit USDA to determine for each reporting farm the annual acreage mix of crops and the amount of direct and counter-cyclical base acreage for each one of those crops.
33. With respect to the period 1996-2001, the regulations under the 1996 FAIR Act required any recipient of PFC payments and marketing loans (or loan deficiency payment) to submit annual acreage reports for each of the commodities planted for harvest on a farm enrolled in such a programme.50 This reporting requirement was a mandatory condition to receive payment. It would

appear that the United States has collected precise acreage and payment information on (1) farms with PFC cotton base acreage, and (2) farms that produced upland cotton and received PFC and marketing loan payments. Combined with the specific farm identification number, this information would clearly permit the matching of information on a farm's crop base acreage and current planting and, thus, the collection of the amount and type of PFC (and market loss assistance) payments made to producers of upland cotton between MY 1999-2001.
34. In sum, the United States has exclusive control of the information that would provide the amount and type of PFC, market loss assistance, direct and counter-cyclical payments made by the US Government to US cotton producers during MY 1999-2002. The United States also has not provided information regarding the amount of updated upland cotton direct and counter-cyclical payment base acreage, the average yields applying to that (updated) base acreage, or the total amount of direct and counter-cyclical payment funds paid to holders of upland base acreage for MY 2002. All of this information is exclusively in the control of the United States and was first requested by Brazil over a year ago.51 The Panel first requested this information in August 2003.52 If the United States continues to refuse to provide this information, then Brazil submits that the Panel must either (1) draw adverse inferences that the information retained by the United States reflects greater payments than those estimated by Brazil,53 or alternatively, (2) rely on Brazil's estimate that the payments equal total upland cotton base acreage payments times the ratio of upland cotton planted acreage to upland cotton base acreage.
(6) Please prepare a chart showing upland cotton base acreage, planted acreage and harvested acreage for MY1996 through 2002. Does the planted acreage fluctuate within a broad band? If not, does this indicate any stability in decisions to plant the same acres to upland cotton? BRA, US
Brazil's Answer:
35. Brazil has prepared the requested chart showing the developments of upland cotton base acreage, planted acreage and harvested acreage between MY 1996-2002.54 The chart below shows that planted acreage does not fluctuate within a broad band. Instead, planted acreage fluctuates between a low of 13.1 million acres in MY 1998 and a high of 15.5 million acres in MY 2001.55

52 Question 67bis. 53 The Appellate Body in Canada ­ Aircraft addressed the issue of drawing adverse inferences from a party's refusal to provide information requested by a panel. It stated that "a panel has the legal authority and the discretion to draw inferences from the facts before it." Moreover, it stated that a panel should examine very closely whether the full ensemble of the facts on the record reasonably permits the inference urged by one of the parties to be drawn, because a party's refusal to collaborate has the potential to undermine the functioning of the dispute settlement system. Furthermore, the Appellate Body noted that if it had been "deciding the issue that confronted the Panel, we might well have concluded that the facts of record did warrant the inference that the information Canada withheld . . . included information prejudicial to Canada's denial that the EDC had conferred a benefit and granted a prohibited export subsidy." (Appellate Body Report, Canada ­ Aircraft, WT/DS70/AB/R, para. 205). 54 Brazil again notes that it is not in a position to provide the updated MY 2002 base acreage, but uses the upland cotton PFC base acreage for that year. 55 Exhibit Bra-293 (Data for Acreage Chart).

36. Indeed, aggregate producers' decisions to plant upland cotton are fairly stable. Despite drastic changes in upland cotton prices, the amount of planted acres only varies within a narrow range, confirming that US producers are largely isolated from upland cotton market price incentives. The data shown in this chart is also consistent with Brazil's argument that most upland cotton was planted on upland cotton base acreage. The amount of acreage planted to upland cotton always remains below the amount of upland cotton base acreage ­ a fact that supports Brazil's assumption that upland cotton producers receive payments related to upland cotton base.56

(7) Brazil states that one third of all US farms with eligible acreage decided to update their base acreage under the direct payments and counter-cyclical payments programmes using their MY1998-2001 acreage. What is the proportion of the current base acreage for upland cotton resulting from such updating? Is the observed updating of base acreage consistent with Brazil's argument that it is only profitable to grow upland cotton on base acreage (and peanut and rice base acreage)? BRA

Brazil's Answer:

37. Regarding the first question, Brazil does not know the proportion of current base acreage for upland cotton resulting from the 2002 updating of the base acreage. This information is exclusively collected and maintained by the United States. As indicated in answer to Question 125(5), USDA required all eligible farms to file applications by 1 June 2002 establishing and updating their base acreage. Brazil notes that the United States was quickly able to report that overall 99.6 per cent of eligible farms enrolled in the programme. This suggests that the United States is in possession of farm-specific information regarding the percentage of (1) the total amount of upland cotton direct and counter-cyclical payment base acreage, and (2) the number of farms growing upland cotton that chose to update their base acreage. Brazil reiterates its request to the United States for this information.57

56 Brazil has discussed the validity of this assumption in its answers to Questions 125 (3) and (8). 57 Exhibit Bra-49 (Brazil's Questions for the Purposes of Annex V Procedure, March 2003) and Exhibit
Bra-101 (Brazil's Questions for the Purposes of the Consultations, 22 November 2002)

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-187
38. The answer to the second question is yes. As indicated in Brazil's Answer to Question 125(2)(c), upland cotton producers would lose money in MY 2000-2001 (even with the subsidies) if they grew upland cotton on anything other than upland cotton or rice base acreage. The record indicates that PFC per acre payments were $30.84 for upland cotton and $23.48 per acre for corn in MY 2001.58 There were no PFC or market loss payments for peanut base under the 1996 FAIR Act.59 Testimony from NCC representatives indicated that a number of producers in the south-eastern part of the United States grew upland cotton on corn base acreage during MY 1999-2001.60 NCC representatives argued that it would only be "fair" for producers with corn base acreage that had switched into upland cotton production to be able to update their base acreage to receive upland cotton direct and counter-cyclical payments.61 NCC's efforts were successful, as reflected in the fact that under the 2002 FSRI Act, maximum total direct and counter-cyclical per acre payments for upland cotton base acreage is $109.50, while for corn it is $54.10 per acre. This large increase in per acre payment for cotton relative to corn in the 2002 FSRI Act reflects the much higher cost of producing upland cotton ­ and the expectation that historic cotton producers receiving such high payments will continue to grow high-cost upland cotton.
39. Given the much higher per acre payments in MY 2002 for upland cotton base acreage, any producer who could gain more upland cotton base acreage would certainly take advantage of the chance to update. Thus, any increases in the updated upland cotton base in MY 2002 reflect the economic incentive to obtain significantly greater additional revenue by switching to upland cotton acreage than in staying with historical corn, wheat, oats, barley sorghum and barley acreage. Finally, the higher per acre payments for upland cotton also reflect the squeeze in profits for those cotton producers that grew upland cotton in MY 1999-2001 on corn base acreage, as testified to by NCC representatives, discussed above.
(8) How could one take account of upland cotton producers who receive PFC, MLA, direct and counter-cyclical payments for other covered commodity base acreage? BRA, US
Brazil's Answer:
40. The best information to use would be the actual data collected by the United States concerning the amount of PFC, MLA, DP, and CCP payments to US upland cotton producers. In the absence of this information, Brazil's methodology assumes that US producers of upland cotton grew upland cotton on upland cotton base acreage. This is a reasonable proxy, because there will be some upland cotton that is grown on rice (and peanut) base receiving higher payments, and some upland cotton that is grown on, e.g., corn base receiving somewhat lower payments. On average, Brazil's approach would roughly cancel out the over-counting of rice and peanut payments and the undercounting of corn and any other lower-paying programme crop payments.

F. PROHIBITED SUBSIDIES
128. Could the US respond to Brazil's assertions relating to the meaning and effect of the introductory phrase of Article 3 ("Except as provided in the Agreement on Agriculture....")? Would the meaning/effect change if Article 13 of the Agreement on Agriculture did not exist? BRA, US
Brazil's Answer:
41. In commenting on the first question directed to the United States, Brazil notes that the United States argues that the phrase "except as provided in the Agreement on Agriculture" necessarily means that negotiators intended to carve out both domestic local content and export subsidies for agricultural products from the disciplines of Article 3 of SCM Agreement.62 But the United States' argument twists the meaning of the phrase "except as provided". The word "except" does not imply that there must be something in the Agreement on Agriculture that carves out the disciplines on local content subsidies in the SCM Agreement. The phrase only means that if the Agreement on Agriculture clearly and unambiguously (i) exempts such agricultural subsidies from the SCM Agreement, or (ii) changes the obligations contained in the SCM Agreement, then the provisions of the Agreement on Agriculture that conflict with those of the SCM Agreement will prevail. The Appellate Body's jurisprudence teaches that it is only where the text clearly and unambiguously provides for modified obligations does the "except as provided" language become operational.63
42. In essence, what the United States seeks from the Panel is an interpretation that the prohibition on local content subsidies does not apply to agricultural goods. Yet, nothing in the Agreement on Agriculture or the SCM Agreement provides the carve-out the United States now seeks.
43. Brazil agrees that the Agreement on Agriculture constitutes lex specialis as opposed to the lex generalis of the SCM Agreement. The Agreement on Agriculture applies to a subset of goods covered by the SCM Agreement and, in case of conflicting provisions, the rights and obligations contained therein should prevail over those of the SCM Agreement. Brazil agrees that the introductory phrase of Article 3 of the SCM Agreement makes explicit the lex specialis nature of the Agreement on Agriculture.
44. However, the US argument goes further than the principle of lex specialis derogat generalis as it is normally applied. The United States wants the Panel to apply this principle in a way that effectively derogates explicit and specific provisions of the SCM Agreement whenever the Agreement on Agriculture is silent about such provisions. This is an absurd application of the lex specialis principle. The lex specialis is to be read together with the lex generalis. In fact, every effort must be made to read the two provisions in a harmonious manner. The derogation of the lex generalis is called for only in situations when an irreconcilable conflict between the two texts arises. It is a fundamental tenet of law that absolute contradictions between laws cannot be presumed; they must be established by a systematic analysis of the texts involved to identify any unequivocal incompatibility. Such conflict or incompatibility does not exist with regard to Article 3.1(b) of the SCM Agreement. The Agreement on Agriculture specifies no right or obligation that would, by necessity, derogate the obligation contained in Article 3.1(b) of the SCM Agreement. The Appellate Body and panels have

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-189
rightly cautioned against interpretations that would exempt disciplines from entire sections of WTO agreements in the absence of a clear and unambiguous carve-out of rights and obligations.64
45. Furthermore, the United States' interpretation, which would (permanently) carve out all agricultural products from the prohibition of Article 3.1(b), is contrary to the object and purpose of Article 3 of the SCM Agreement. Negotiators expressed their intent that local content subsidies are a special class of trade-distorting subsidies. Because of their particularly trade-distortive nature, negotiators dispensed with the requirement of showing any adverse effects and made them prohibited subsidies. Given the special prohibited nature of such subsidies ­ coupled with the ability of negotiators to carve such subsidies out explicitly from the operation of the SCM Agreement ­ it would be expected that any exception from the disciplines would be clear and unambiguous.
46. The answer to the second question is "no". As Brazil's earlier submissions have articulated, Article 13(b) is not the only basis for Brazil's argument that the Agreement on Agriculture does not carve out agricultural local content subsidies from the Article 3.1(b) prohibition of local content subsidies.65 As Brazil has argued, there is no inherent conflict between requiring the notification and scheduling of payments to processors of agricultural goods benefiting domestic producers under Annex 3, paragraph 7 of the Agreement on Agriculture and the prohibition on payments to processors of agricultural goods that are contingent upon the use of domestic over imported goods.66 Nevertheless, the absence of any reference to Article 3 of the SCM Agreement in Article 13(b) of the Agreement on Agriculture (while a similar reference exists for export subsidies) is consistent with Brazil's other arguments that local content subsidies for agricultural goods are prohibited subsidies.
47. The US interpretation eliminating any prohibitions on agricultural local content subsidies creates a sharp distinction in the way that the other group of normally prohibited subsidies ­ subsidies contingent upon export ­ are treated under the Agreement on Agriculture. The Agreement on Agriculture provides many instances in which export subsidies for an individual agricultural product may be challenged as prohibited subsidies under the Agreement on Agriculture. These include prohibitions on export subsidies for unscheduled products, prohibitions on subsidies given to products where support is beyond the scheduled reduction commitments, and prohibitions on subsidies that lead to circumvention of export subsidy reduction commitments. By contrast, under the US interpretation of local content subsidies, there will never be an instance in which local content subsidies for an individual agricultural product would ever be prohibited.
48. It would be expected that such radically different treatment of local content subsidies would be spelled out clearly in the Agreement on Agriculture. Yet, the only link the United States can find to justify its total exclusion of local content prohibited subsidies is the provision in Annex 3, paragraph 7 to include local content subsidies ­ along with the multitude of other types of domestic subsidies that are not prohibited subsidies ­ in the support to be counted for total AMS. All that Annex 3, paragraph 7 stipulates is that AMS calculations shall include measures that "benefit the producers of the basic agricultural products". Such language contains nothing that conflicts with the obligation established in Article 3.1(b) of the SCM Agreement. Brazil notes that measures that "benefit the producers of the basic agricultural products" may or may not be "contingent upon the use of domestic over imported good". In both situations these subsidies must be included in AMS calculations. However, when challenged under the DSU, those subsidies that require local content

will be found to violate Article 3.1(b) of the SCM Agreement, and the subsidizing Member will be urged to withdraw such measures.
G. SPECIFICITY/CROP INSURANCE
129. In the event that the Panel does not consider that the alleged prohibited subsidies fall within the provisions of Article 3 and are therefore, pursuant to Article 2.3, "deemed to be specific", are there any other grounds on which Brazil would rely in order to support the view that such measures are "specific" within the meaning of Article 2 of the SCM Agreement (see, for example, fn 16 of Brazil's further submission)? BRA
Brazil's Answer:
49. Brazil brought prohibited subsidy claims against the Step 2 export and domestic payments, as well as against the CCC export credit guarantee programmes GSM 102, GSM 103 and SCGP. Concerning the latter, only GSM 102 is relevant for Brazil's serious prejudice claims and, thus, the questions of specificity within the meaning of Article 2 of the SCM Agreement only needs to be addressed for that subsidy.
50. Step 2 export and domestic payments are de jure specific subsidies because they are only available for exporters and domestic users of upland cotton.67 Exporters or domestic users of extralong staple cotton, any other crop or any other product are not eligible to receive Step 2 payments. Consequently, the United States has notified Step 2 payments as cotton-specific non-green box domestic support.68 Thus, Step 2 payments are specific within the meaning of Article 2.1 of the SCM Agreement in much the same way as marketing loan payments or cottonseed payments.
51. Brazil notes that the Panel's question raises a hypothetical situation that is highly unlikely given the clear export contingency of the GSM 102 export credit guarantee programme. Unlike the crop insurance programme, GSM 102 export credit guarantees are available for exports of most US agricultural commodities.69 However, GSM 102 support is provided only to enterprises exporting agricultural products and, thus, for the reasons set forth in Brazil's answer to Question 131(a), these subsidies are both de jure and de facto specific. 70
130. Does Brazil agree that the US insurance premium subsidy is available in respect of all agricultural products? Please cite relevant portions of the record. BRA
Brazil's Answer:
52. Brazil does not agree that the US crop insurance premium subsidy is available in respect of all agricultural products. At the outset, Brazil would like to clarify that the US crop insurance programme encompasses two different types of subsidies. First, the US Federal Crop Insurance Corporation pays farmers a portion of the premiums that they have to pay for obtaining crop insurance.71 Second, the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation covers losses under crop insurance
67 Exhibit Bra-29 (Section 1207(a) of the 2002 FSRI Act) and Exhibit Bra-28 (Section 136(a) of the 1996 FAIR Act).
68 See e.g. Exhibit Bra-47 (G/AG/N/USA/43, p. 20). Brazil disagrees with the classification of Step 2 export payments as "domestic support." Brazil also considers Step 2 domestic payments to be prohibited local content subsidies within the meaning of Article 3.1(b) of the SCM Agreement and Article III:4 of GATT 1994.
69 See Brazil's Comment to Question 142. 70 See Brazil's Answer to Question 131. 71 Exhibit Bra-30 (Section 508(e) and Section 508(h)(5)(A) of the Federal Crop Insurance Act). Exhibit Bra-59 ("Briefing Room: Farm and Commodity Policy: Crop Yield and Revenue Insurance").

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-191
policies that exceed the amount of premiums collected, thus providing free reinsurance for private insurance companies offering crop insurance.72
53. Brazil has demonstrated that crop insurance policies that are eligible for subsidy payments ­ both premium and reinsurance subsidies ­ are not available in respect of all agricultural products. The United States claims that crop insurance subsidies are and will in the future be available to livestock and dairy producers.73 This assertion is incorrect. First, it is entirely irrelevant if crop insurance will be available to livestock and dairy producers in the future. The question that faces the Panel is whether the US crop insurance subsidies in MY 1999-2002 are specific, not whether they may at some point in the future become less specific. Brazil demonstrated that except for a very narrow pilot programme that began in MY 2002, there were no livestock "crop" insurance policies during MY 1999-2002.
54. Second, Brazil has demonstrated that crop insurance is currently ­ in MY 2003 ­ only available to livestock producers in a limited number of US states and counties.74 The Adjusted Gross Revenue policy cited by the United States75 covers only "incidental amounts of income from animals and animal products and aquaculture reared in a controlled environment," which must not exceed "35 per cent of expected allowable income".76 In addition, this policy is only available for producers in a limited number of counties in 18 US states.77 Even making the entirely unrealistic assumption that all US livestock in those pilot counties would be eligible for adjusted gross revenue coverage, that production78 would only represent 7.58 per cent of the value of total US livestock production.79 In addition, Brazil has demonstrated that the total value of US livestock and dairy production represents 52 per cent of the value of total US agriculture.80 Thus, even taking into account the pilot counties for the adjusted gross revenue coverage, at least 48 per cent of the value of US agriculture is excluded from crop insurance subsidy benefits.
55. Third, the 2000 ARP Act itself explicitly limits its application to, inter alia, US crops, and does not cover insurance for the production of dairy, beef, poultry, pork and other livestock.81
56. In sum, the US crop insurance subsidies are not available to all US agricultural production.

73 US 30 September Further Submission, para. 15. 74 Brazil's 7 October Oral Statement, para. 7. 75 Brazil notes that this policy is the only one that is cited by the United States in support of its allegation that crop insurance would be available to all US agricultural products. Brazil is not aware of any other policy that would enable and in particular enabled US dairy or livestock producers during MY 1999-2002 to benefit from crop insurance subsidies. 76 Exhibit Bra-272 ("Fact Sheet: Adjusted Gross Revenue," Risk Management Agency, USDA, February 2003, p. 1). 77 Exhibit Bra-272 ("Fact Sheet: Adjusted Gross Revenue," Risk Management Agency, USDA, February 2003, p. 1,3). 78 The record shows that most farms are small, and that many small farms specialize in beef production. See Bra-285 ("Agriculture Fact Book 2001-2002, Chapter 3 ­ American Farms, Figures 3.1 and 3.8). Therefore, these farms could not be eligible under the pilot programme because more than 35 per cent of their revenue is generated from the production of livestock. This suggests that even the figure of 7.58 per cent of total US livestock production is a significant overestimate. 79 Exhibit Bra-271 (Analysis of the Market Value of Livestock in Adjusted Gross Revenue Insurance Pilot States and Counties). 80 Brazil's 22 August Rebuttal Submission, para. 59 and Exhibit Bra-177 ("ERS Briefing Room: Farm Income and Costs: Farm Income Forecasts"). 81 Exhibit Bra-30 (Section 518 of the Federal Crop Insurance Act) contains a list of the "agricultural commodities" covered by insurance policies that are subsidized under the Federal Crop Insurance Act.

131. How should the concept of specificity ­ and, in particular, the concept of specificity to "an enterprise or industry or group of enterprises or industries" -- in Article 2 of the SCM Agreement apply to subsidies in respect of agricultural commodities? Please answer the following questions, citing the principles in Article 2 of the SCM Agreement: BRA, US
(a) is a subsidy in respect of all agricultural, but not other, products specific?
(b) is a subsidy in respect of all agricultural crops (i.e. but not to other agricultural commodities, such as livestock) specific?
(c) is a subsidy in respect of certain identified agricultural products specific?
(d) is a subsidy in respect of upland cotton, but not other products, specific?
(e) is a subsidy in respect of a certain proportion of the value of total US commodities (or total US agricultural commodities) specific?
(f) is a subsidy in respect of a certain proportion of total US farmland specific?
Brazil's Answer:
57. The short answer to Questions 131(a) ­ (f) is "yes."
58. Brazil's Further Submission sets forth a detailed analysis of the legal requirements for de facto and de jure specificity (paras. 34-40), demonstrating the broad agreement between the official US interpretation of Article 2 of the SCM Agreement in the Statement of Administrative Action ("SAA") and the position of Brazil. Brazil also provided a detailed application of those requirements for each of the relevant subsidies (paras. 41-70). Brazil offers the following additional comments below:
59. With respect to Question 131(a), a US subsidy that is made available to all enterprises in the industry producing agricultural commodities is specific. As Brazil and the United States agree, the purpose of the specificity requirements is to "function as an initial screening mechanism to winnow out only those foreign subsidies which truly are broadly available and widely used throughout an economy".82 The United States' SAA notes that "all governments, including the United States, intervene in their economies to one extent or another, and to regard all such interventions as countervailable would produce absurd results". Among such "absurd results" would be countervailing "public highways and bridges, as well as a tax credit for expenditures on capital investment even if available to all industries and sectors".83 After providing these examples, the SAA states that "the specificity test was not intended to function as a loophole through which narrowly focused subsidies provided to or used by discrete segments of an economy could escape the purview of the CVD law".84
60. The US subsidies at issue in this case ­ including crop insurance ­ are de jure limited under Article 2.1(a) because they "explicitly limit access to a subsidy to certain enterprises", i.e., those producing, using, or exporting either crops, certain crops, or one crop.85 The US subsidies are also de facto specific under Article 2.1(c) because they are used by a limited number of enterprises in relation to all enterprises and industries making up the US economy. Only the group of enterprises

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-193
producing agricultural crops is entitled to receive or actually use these subsidies. All other enterprises and all other industries are excluded from the right to receive and, in fact, do not use such subsidies.
61. The broad diversification of the US economy is a relevant fact for the Panel to consider for de facto specificity under Article 2.1(c) ("account shall be taken of the extent of diversification of economic activities within the jurisdiction of the granting authority".). The US SAA indicates that the US Department of Commerce should take "account of the number of industries in the economy in question" in "determining whether the number of industries using a subsidy is small or large".86 The US industry growing and producing agricultural products, or even the sub-industry of US producers who grow crops, are in the words of the US SAA, "a discrete segment" of the US economy. The value of all US agricultural production of all commodities is only 0.8 per cent of total US GDP.87 Article 2.1(c) requires a Panel to undertake a "case by case" approach to diversification, and Brazil believes the approach presented here and endorsed by the US SAA is an appropriate application of the provision. In the case of the United States, there is a multitude of US industries that do not use the US subsidies at issue in this case. By contrast, in the case of Benin, the agricultural industry represents 38 per cent of its GDP.88 For a country like Benin, subsidies to the entire agriculture sector would most likely not be considered to be specific because they are widely available to a large portion of the producers within the economy. No such facts exist for the cotton subsidies at issue in this dispute.
62. Brazil sees no basis in the text of Article 2 of the SCM Agreement for a different specificity test to be applied to subsidies for the purpose of Part V (countervailing measures) and Part III (actionable subsidies) of the SCM Agreement. Nor does Brazil see any basis to apply a different test of specificity for agricultural and other types of goods and industries ­ no such distinction exists in Article 2 of the SCM Agreement. For example, would a subsidy provided only to the US automotive parts industry (which includes thousands of enterprises) be specific while a subsidy provided to thousands of enterprises producing agricultural crops not be specific? There cannot be much doubt that the US automotive parts industry is a discrete segment of the US economy, and a discrete "industry". Brazil (and the US SAA) is of the view that in both these instances, the subsidy would be specific. All of the US subsidies challenged by Brazil are narrowly focused on, at most, a portion of the industry producing agricultural products.
63. With respect to Question 131(b), a subsidy that is provided to enterprises producing all agricultural crops is specific. Because the applicable industry is the one producing all agricultural commodities, a subsidy to only enterprises producing crops but not to enterprises producing other agricultural commodities is specific. Brazil notes the entirely different approach the United States now asserts in this case, regarding crop insurance, and the official interpretation offered in the SAA.89 While the Panel, of course, is not bound by the unilateral interpretation of the United States in the SAA, Brazil believes that the SAA, in this instance, correctly described the intent of the drafters regarding specificity. The producers of US crops are discrete enterprises within a US industry. None of these subsidies is provided to enterprises producing other types of agricultural products that make up approximately 50 per cent of the value of the US agricultural commodities.90 In the case of crop insurance, it is useful to recall that many of the small US farming enterprises ­ representing 92 per cent of US farms ­ produce livestock, including beef.91

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-194
64. In deciding the question, the Panel should also take into account the significant implications of accepting the US arguments that any subsidy provided to all agricultural producers of all agricultural commodities would be non-specific. This interpretation would create a new class of trade-distorting agricultural subsidies that are non-actionable. The United States has always notified its crop insurance subsidies as amber box subsidies, i.e., presumptively trade distorting. And USDA economists have found that even lower subsidies provided by the pre-2000 ARP Act increased US upland cotton acreage by 1.2 per cent and US upland cotton exports by 2 per cent.92 Professor Sumner found that the higher subsidies provided by the 2002 ARP Act increased US upland cotton acreage by 3.3 per cent, US exports by 3.8 per cent, and decreased world A-Index prices by 1.3 per cent on average for each year between MY 2000-2002.93
65. The US specificity interpretation would permit, for example, a Member to provide a revenue guarantee to every enterprise producing any agricultural commodity to pay for the total cost of production plus a reasonable profit margin of 10 per cent. The US interpretation would permit Members to make direct payments to every farming enterprise that are tied to a constructed average price index for all agricultural products (not individual prices such as the CCP) and a farmer's current total production. A Member could also provide free inputs for the production of all agricultural commodities to every enterprise producing any agricultural product without that subsidy being actionable under Articles 5 and 6 of the SCM Agreement. In short, if the criteria is, as the United States argues, that the subsidy only need be provided to all farming enterprises, then any type of trade distorting non-green box domestic subsidy meeting that universal application criteria would escape discipline under the SCM Agreement.
66. The USinterpretation would create a gaping hole in the disciplines of the Agreement on Agriculture and the SCM Agreement. Such an interpretation is clearly inconsistent with the object and purpose of the Agreement on Agriculture, which is to "correct[] and prevent[] restrictions and distortions in world agricultural markets". It is inconsistent with the SCM Agreement's object and purpose of disciplining trade-distorting actionable subsidies. And it is completely inconsistent with the interpretation including in the United States' SAA.
67. With respect to Questions 131(c) and (d), for the reasons set forth above and in Brazil's earlier submissions, a subsidy that is mandated to be provided to only certain enterprises in respect of a handful of identified agricultural products (such as the 10 "programme" crops of the direct and counter-cyclical payment programme) but not provided to most other enterprises within the agricultural industry producing crops or agricultural commodities, is specific under Article 2.1(a) of the SCM Agreement. Similarly, there is de facto specificity because these same subsidies covered by the Panel's questions (c) and (d) are only used by certain enterprises of the overall industry producing agricultural commodities (which is the case for all the US subsidies except crop insurance and GSM 102).94
68. Regarding Question 131(e), if a subsidy is paid only to enterprises that produce or manufacture products representing a certain portion of the value of the products of a single industry (such as the US industry producing agricultural commodities), then the subsidy would be specific. Evaluating specificity based on the "value" of products produced by a single industry is a useful tool for measuring the extent to which the subsidy is provided to discrete enterprises within an industry, or within an economy. When many enterprises in the most highly revenue generating segments of an industry do not receive a subsidy ­ such as the absence of crop insurance for livestock including beef, poultry and pork, among others ­ then the subsidy is specific because it is only used by a certain number of enterprises within the industry.

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-195
69. Finally, with respect to Question 131(f), another tool for evaluating the specificity of a subsidy is the amount of total US farmland that receives the subsidy. The use of "farmland" is a rough proxy for the number of enterprises producing agricultural products within the meaning of Article 2.1. For example, only 38 per cent of US farmland is used for the growing of crops (including hay) that are eligible for the payment of crop insurance.95 By contrast, 62 per cent of US farmland is used for the production of livestock that, with only a few exceptions, is not covered by US crop insurance. When used in conjunction with the "value" data discussed in Question 131(e) above, this acreage data confirms the fact that a number of enterprises within the industry producing agricultural commodities do not receive the crop insurance subsidy. Brazil notes that the United States has not contested the use of similar acreage data to demonstrate the specificity of other US subsidies.96
H. EXPORT CREDIT GUARANTEES
137. Please elaborate the meaning of "net losses" as is used in paragraph 70 of Brazil's 7 October oral statement. BRA
Brazil's Answer:
70. The term "net losses" was, in the context of an oral statement, merely a shorthand reference to the elements of item (j) ­ the provision of the CCC guarantee programmes at "premium rates which are inadequate to cover the long-term operating costs and losses of the programmes".
71. To prove that the CCC guarantee programmes suffered "net losses" (or in other words meet the elements of item (j)), Brazil referred, in paragraph 70, to the comparison of cohort-specific subsidy figures from the "guaranteed loan subsidy" line of the US budget with cohort-specific reestimates from Table 8 of the Federal Credit Supplement97, summed over the period 1992-2002 to determine the performance of the CCC programmes over the long term.
72. Whether starting with the cohort-specific subsidy figure from the budget year column of the US budget or with the cohort-specific subsidy figure from the prior year column of the US budget, the result of this exercise is a positive subsidy number.98 The CCC arrives at the very same result in its 2002 financial statements. Specifically, the 2002 financial statements provide a cumulative subsidy figure for all post-1991 CCC guarantees, taking account of all adjustments for defaults, fees and reestimates undertaken for all cohorts in all years through 2002. This exercise results in a cumulative
95 Exhibit Bra-143 (Agricultural Statistics 2003, National Agricultural Statistics Service, USDA. Table IX-6; See also Summary of Business Application, Risk Management Agency. USDA. Accessed 21/10/03, http://www3.rma.usda.gov/apps/sob/ Based on the 1997 census (the most recent year), the total land in farms is 968,338,000 acres; the total cropland used for crops was 348,701,000 acres; idle cropland and grassland pasture was 580,165,000 acres; the number of acres insured on rangeland, forage seed, forage production, alfalfa seed (i.e., crops that could be grown on grassland pasture) was 12,575,000 acres. If cropland not used for crops was included, then the total amount of acreage not producing insured commodities would be 58.61 per cent and the total amount of acreage used to produce insured (or potentially insured) commodities under the 2002 ARP Act would be 41.39 per cent. Brazil notes that this does not include any reference to the recent pilot programs discussed elsewhere. However, the percentages would not change to any great extent if such acreage were included, given the 35 per cent limit on livestock imposed by the crop insurance program.
96 See Brazil's 9 September Further Submission, paras. 43-61 (discussion of specificity regarding PFC, MLA, DP, and CCP subsidies).
97 Table 8 of the 2004 Federal Credit Supplement is included at Exhibit Bra-182. 98 Brazil has offered calculations using the cohort-specific subsidy estimate from the budget year column of the US budget (para. 115 of Brazil's 22 August Rebuttal Submission), and using the cohort-specific subsidy estimate from the prior year column of the US budget (Exhibit Bra-193).

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-196
positive subsidy figure of $411 million for the period 1992-2002.99 The Panel will recall that under the Federal Credit Reform Act, when "payments from" the government exceed "payments to" the government on a net present value basis, a positive subsidy results, meaning that CCC is "los[ing] money".100
73. Brazil has explained that the FCRA cost formula is one way to determine the performance of the CCC export credit guarantee programmes relative to the elements of item (j). Application of the formula demonstrates that over the period 1992-2002, CCC guarantees under the GSM 102, GSM 103 and SCGP programmes were provided "at premium rates which are inadequate to cover the long-term operating costs and losses of the programmes."
74. The United States objects to the appropriateness of the FCRA formula as a proxy for the analysis required by item (j).101 The United States' objection is based on the fact that re-estimates are still being undertaken for all CCC guarantee cohorts during the period 1992-2002. Brazil has therefore also offered a number of other methods to confirm that operating costs and losses for the CCC guarantee programmes outpace premiums collected during the period 1992-2002102, or in other words, that the CCC guarantee programmes suffered "net losses" over that long-term period.
138. Please comment on Brazil's views stated in paragraph 70 of its 7 October oral statement. US
Brazil's Comment:
75. Brazil notes an inadvertent error in paragraph 70 of its 7 October Oral Statement. Exhibit Bra-193 does indeed compare cohort-specific reestimates to cohort-specific subsidy figures from the prior year column of the US budget. However, the comparison of cohort-specific reestimates to cohort-specific subsidy figures from the budget year column of the US budget is reflected in the table at paragraph 115 of Brazil's 22 August Rebuttal Submission, rather than in Exhibit Bra-192.
76. In Exhibit Bra-192, Brazil subtracted downward reestimates from and added upward reestimates to the original subsidy figure included in the budget year column of the "guaranteed loan subsidy" line of the annual US budget.
139. In the context of export credit guarantees, is the Panel correct in understanding that Brazil's claims of inconsistency with the Agriculture Agreement involve GSM 102, GSM 103 and SCGP, but that it limits its "serious prejudice" allegations in respect of export credit guarantee programmes to the GSM 102 programme, and does not challenge GSM 103 and SCGP in this respect? If so,
(a) could Brazil please explain why it did so, and confirm that all the data relied upon in its further submissions (e.g. in Table 13) relate to the GSM 102 programme rather than to GSM 102, GSM 103 and SCGP (and, if the data needs to be adjusted to take account of a narrower "serious prejudice" focus, supply GSM-102-relevant data)? BRA

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-197
77. The Panel is correct in understanding that Brazil's serious prejudice claims involve only GSM 102. All tables and figures that make reference to export credit guarantees in the context of Brazil's serious prejudice claims represent data on GSM 102 only. The reason that Brazil's serious prejudice claims do not cover GSM 103 and SCGP is that either no cotton allocations were made under the programme (GSM 103 for most of the marketing years covered by the period of investigation) or that only negligible amounts of cotton were exported under the programme (SCGP and ­ if exports took place ­ GSM 103).103 Almost all US upland cotton exports that benefited from a CCC export credit guarantee were covered by the GSM 102 programme. Thus, the only CCC export credit guarantee programme that significantly contributed to the upland cotton-related serious prejudice suffered by Brazil was the GSM 102 programme. Consequently, Brazil has excluded GSM 103 and SCGP from its serious prejudice claims.
78. However, Brazil has included GSM 102, GSM 103 and SCGP in its export subsidy claims under the Agreement on Agriculture and the SCM Agreement. All three CCC export credit guarantee programmes constitute export subsidies within the meaning of Articles 10.1, 8 and 1(e) of the Agreement on Agriculture and Articles 1 and 3.1(a) of the SCM Agreement, and fulfil the criteria of item (j) of the Illustrative List of Export Subsidies attached as Annex I to the SCM Agreement.
(b) for the purposes of Article 13(c)(ii) of the Agreement on Agriculture, is it necessary for the Panel to examine only GSM 102 or should the Panel's examination include also GSM 103 and SCGP? Why or why not? BRA
79. The Panel needs to examine all three programmes under Article 13(c)(ii) of the Agreement on Agriculture. This provision exempts export subsidies from actions based on Article XVI of GATT 1994 and Articles 3, 5 and 6 of the SCM Agreement. Brazil has brought claims under Article XVI of GATT and Articles 5 and 6 of the SCM Agreement against CCC's GSM 102 export credit guarantee programme. Thus, to properly address these claims, the Panel needs to determine whether the GSM 102 programme fully conforms to the provisions of Part V of the Agreement on Agriculture, within the meaning of Article 13(c)(ii) of that Agreement.
80. In addition, Brazil has brought claims under Article 3.1(a) of the SCM Agreement against CCC's GSM 102, GSM 103 and SCGP export credit guarantee programmes. To properly address these claims, the Panel needs to determine whether the GSM 102, GSM 103 and SCGP programmes fully conform to the provisions of Part V of the Agreement on Agriculture, within the meaning of Article 13(c)(ii) of that agreement.
81. To demonstrate that CCC's GSM 102, GSM 103 and SCGP programmes do not fully conform to the provisions of Part V of the Agreement on Agriculture, Brazil has established that GSM 102, GSM 103 and SCGP constitute export subsidies and violate Articles 10.1 and 8 of the Agreement on Agriculture by circumventing or threatening to circumvent US export subsidy reduction commitments. The programmes, thus, do not conform fully to the provisions of Part V of the Agreement on Agriculture.
140. Could Brazil explain how, if at all, it has treated export credit guarantees for the purpose of Table 1 of its further submission? BRA
82. Brazil has not included GSM 102 for the purpose of Table 1 of its Further Submission. While Brazil has demonstrated that GSM 102 export credit guarantees constitute export subsidies within the meaning of the Agreement on Agriculture and the SCM Agreement104, Brazil is not in a position to quantify the benefit to the recipients that has arisen from the application of the GSM 102 export credit
103 Exhibit Bra-73 (Summary of Export Credit Guarantee Programs FY 1999-2003). 104 Brazil's 22 August Rebuttal Submission, para. 102-110

guarantee programme to exports of US upland cotton between MY 1999-2002. Brazil has no data ­ nor has the United States provided any ­ that would enable it to calculate the benefit involved in the GSM 102 transactions.105
83. However, the National Cotton Council, which represents the industry benefiting from the GSM 102 programme, has provided what appears to be a reasonable estimate of the benefits to US upland cotton producers, users and exporters. These benefits are significant enough to generate an additional 500,000 bales of US upland cotton exports per year and to raise domestic US prices by 3 cents per pound.106
84. Having proven the export subsidy character of the GSM 102 programme, as well as having proven the production and export-enhancing as well as A-Index-suppressing effects of the programme107, Brazil has met its burden of proof under Articles 5 and 6.3 of the SCM Agreement and GATT Article XVI to establish that the GSM 102 programme causes serious prejudice to the interests of Brazil.
141. The Panel notes the US argument, inter alia in its further submission, that the export credit guarantee programmes are "self-sustaining". Recalling that item (j) of the Illustrative List of Export Subsidies in Annex I of the SCM Agreement refers to "premium rates", could the US expand upon how it takes into account the premium rates for the export credit guarantee programmes in its analysis. US
Brazil's Comment:
85. As Brazil has argued elsewhere, the United States cannot make a showing that the CCC guarantee programmes do not constitute export subsidies by appealing to an a contrario interpretation of item (j), since item (j) does not admit of an a contrario defense.108
86. Even if item (j) does admit of an a contrario defense, proving that the CCC programmes are "self-sustaining" is not enough. Were an a contrario defense possible, it would require the United States to demonstrate that over a period constituting the long term, "premium rates" are adequate to cover operating costs and losses, which include but are not limited to "claims or defaults". In contrast, the United States has argued that it is sufficient to show that "claims or defaults" do not exceed "revenue from whatever source it may be derived".109 "Revenue from whatever source it may be derived" gives credit to the United States for revenue that is not recognized as relevant for the purposes of item (j), and "claims or defaults" ignores "operating costs and losses" that are relevant for the purposes of item (j).110
87. As a factual matter, Brazil quite evidently does not agree that the premium rates for the CCC programmes meet their long-term operating costs and losses. Brazil has presented voluminous quantitative data demonstrating that long-term operating costs and losses incurred by the CCC programmes outpace premiums collected. Brazil has also provided statements from the USDA Inspector General111 and the US General Accounting Office112 establishing that CCC's failure to
105 However, Brazil has established that GSM 102 guarantees confer benefits per se, since there is no comparable commercial instrument available in the marketplace.

account for country risk or the credit rating of the borrower in setting guarantee fees means that CCC is charging "premium rates" that do not allow it to cover its operating costs and losses over the longterm.
142. The US has pointed out that there are many limitations on granting export credit guarantees and that there is no requirement to issue any particular guarantee (US further submission, paras 153-156). Can the Commodity Credit Corporation decline to grant an export credit guarantee even in cases where the programme conditions are met? US
Brazil's Comment:
88. No, the CCC cannot decline to grant an export credit guarantee even in cases where the programme conditions are met. The CCC cannot "stem[], or otherwise control[], the flow of" CCC export credit guarantees.113 The CCC export credit guarantee programmes therefore threaten to lead to (and in fact have led to) circumvention of the United States' export subsidy reduction commitments, within the meaning of Article 10.1 of the Agreement on Agriculture.
89. Under the Budget Enforcement Act of 1990, the US Office of Management and Budget classifies the CCC export credit guarantee programmes as "mandatory".114 Mandatory programmes like the CCC export credit guarantee programmes are exempt from the requirement in US law that a programme receive new Congressional budget authority before it undertakes new loan guarantee commitments.115 As the Congressional Budget Office has noted, support via mandatory programmes like the CCC export credit guarantee programmes "must be available to all eligible borrowers", without regard to appropriations limits.116 The Congressional Research Service has similarly stated that "[e]ligibility for mandatory programmes is written into law, and any individual or entity that meets the eligibility requirements is entitled to a payment as authorized by the law".117
90. The fact that the CCC can deny guarantees to individuals who do not meet the eligibility criteria does not, of course, affect the conclusion that CCC cannot "stem[], or otherwise control[], the flow of" CCC export credit guarantees.118 The United States' FSC measure had eligibility criteria, but
export credit guarantee programmes have not been changed in 7 years and may not be reflecting current costs".).

At paragraph 110 of its 22 August Comments on US Answers, Brazil included an extract from this General Accounting Office study demonstrating that CCC's low premium rates do not allow it to cover its costs and losses, and that the CCC programmes do not meet non-market, let alone market, benchmarks.

See also Id., Table 2, which verifies that the CCC export credit guarantee programmes are "mandatory" programs. Brazil notes that this does not mean that the CCC programmes do not receive appropriations. The United States acknowledges in its 11 August Answer to Question 11 that the CCC programmes receive appropriations. 117 Exhibit Bra-186 (Congressional Research Service Issue Brief for Congress, "Agriculture and the Budget", IB95031 (16 February 1996), p. 3 (emphasis added)). 118 Appellate Body Report, US ­ FSC, WT/DS108/AB/R, para. 149.

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-200
the Appellate Body still concluded that nothing in the measure "stem[ed], or otherwise control[led], the flow of" FSC benefits, leading to a threat of circumvention of the United States' export subsidy reduction commitments.119
91. The entitlement that qualified applicants have to CCC guarantees is not curtailed by the requirement in US law that CCC not make available guarantees to countries that cannot adequately service debt.120 That CCC has the authority to deny guarantees on this basis is not relevant, for at least three reasons.
92. First, under the United States' FSC measure, US authorities were permitted to undertake a factual enquiry into whether the foreign-source income of the foreign corporation was "effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the United States".121 This authority, and the possibility that the factual enquiry could limit the amount of income that would qualify for the FSC exemption, did not prevent the Appellate Body from concluding that nothing in the FSC measure "stem[ed], or otherwise control[led], the flow of" FSC benefits, leading to a threat of circumvention of the United States' export subsidy reduction commitments.122 Similarly, the authority that CCC has to undertake an enquiry into whether particular countries are creditworthy, and the possibility that this enquiry could end up reducing the amount of CCC guarantees, does not prevent a conclusion that nothing "stem[s], or otherwise control[s], the flow of" CCC guarantees. (Brazil notes that, in any event, a conclusion by CCC that a particular country is not creditworthy would not necessarily reduce the threat of circumvention, since nothing prevents CCC from simply reassigning the country's allocation to a country that is creditworthy.)
93. Second, as Brazil has previously noted, the US General Accounting Office ("GAO") concluded that the requirement that CCC not make available guarantees to countries that cannot adequately service debt does not remotely curtail CCC's extension of its guarantees. According to the GAO, "the statute does not place any limit on the amount of guarantees that can be provided each year to high-risk countries in aggregate or individually".123 Thus, the theoretical possibility to halt support to non-creditworthy countries does not "stem[], or otherwise control[]," the flow of CCC guarantees.124
94. Third, CCC is not concerned enough about creditworthiness to vary its fees based on the country risk involved.125 Nor does US law require the CCC to take account of the creditworthiness of individual guarantee recipients in the fee charged. In fact, CCC fees expressly do not take account of the credit rating of an individual borrower.126 Thus, even if CCC finds a country to be creditworthy, it is not compensated for particularly poor individual credit risks.
95. Nor is the entitlement that qualified applicants have to CCC guarantees curtailed by CCC's ability to adopt product- and country-specific allocations for its export credit guarantee programmes. Although CCC adopts initial allocations at the outset of a fiscal year, it generously increases those allocations as needed. In its announcement of initial allocations for fiscal year 2004, for example, which extends $2.8 billion in allocations for CCC guarantees, USDA stated that CCC will subsequently make additional allocations throughout the year that will bring total 2004 allocations to

more than $6 billion.127 Browsing the archived list of USDA press releases announcing supplemental allocations extended throughout fiscal year 2003,128 for example, demonstrates that this is exactly what CCC does ­ it increases allocations as needed. As noted above, CCC is not required to receive new Congressional budget authority before it undertakes these additional allocations. In fact, Congress requires CCC to make available at least $5.5 billion in guarantees ­ it does not put a ceiling on the amount to be granted.129 The allocation process does not "stem[], or otherwise control[]", the flow of CCC export credit guarantees.130 In fact, it enables CCC to increase the guarantees it can provide.
96. Nor does CCC's ability to adopt product-specific allocations for its export credit guarantee programmes mitigate the significant threat, under Article 10.1 of the Agreement on Agriculture, that the United States will surpass its agricultural export subsidy reduction commitments by virtue of the CCC export credit guarantee programmes. This threat implicates both unscheduled and scheduled agricultural commodities.
97. For unscheduled products, the ability to adopt allocations is irrelevant. Since CCC export credit guarantees are available for unscheduled products131, the threat of circumvention of the US reduction commitments is tangible, and the United States is in violation of Article 10.1. As Brazil has previously noted, the Appellate Body held that for unscheduled products, it is inconsistent with Article 10.1 to provide any export subsidies.132 Moreover, the record demonstrates that the threat has materialized, since CCC guarantees have been extended to unscheduled products during, for example, 1999-2003.133
98. For scheduled products, the process of adopting product-specific allocations for CCC export credit guarantee programmes does not mitigate the threat of circumvention ­ or does not "stem[], or otherwise control[]", the flow of CCC export credit guarantees ­ for at least three reasons.134
99. First, as the list of allocations included in the programme activity report for fiscal year 2003 demonstrates135, most allocations are only made on a country-specific basis, and not on a productspecific basis. In fact, less than 8 per cent of the allocations listed on the 2003 programme activity

Exports of unscheduled agricultural products that are eligible for CCC export credit guarantee coverage include: barley malt and barley extract, corn products, cotton (including cotton yarn, cotton fabric, cotton products, including cotton linters), fish and shellfish, fresh and dried fruits (including apples, apricots, avocados, blueberries, cherries, clementines, dates, figs, grapefruits, grapes, kiwi, watermelons, cantaloupe, honeydrew, nectarines, oranges, peaches, pears, plums, prunes, raisins, raspberries, strawberries, tangerines and mixtures thereof), fruit and vegetable concentrates, 100 per cent fruit juices, hay, hides and skins, honey, soybean protein products, vegetables (including asparagus, beans, broccoli, carrots, cauliflower, celery, garlic, lettuce, mushrooms, onions, peas, peppers, potatoes, spinach, squash, sweet corn, tomatoes, and mixtures thereof), wood products (including lumber etc.), wool (including wool fabrics, wool yarn and mohair), worms. 132 Appellate Body Report, US ­ FSC, WT/DS108/AB/R, para. 150. 133 Exhibit Bra-299 ("Summary of FY 2003 Export Credit Guarantee Programme Activity", USDA, covering GSM-102, GSM-103 and SCGP).

report are product-specific.136 The press release announcing initial allocations for 2004 contains no product-specific allocations. These allocations do not "stem[], or otherwise control[], the flow of" CCC export credit guarantees in a way that would curb the threat that they will be used to surpass the United States' export subsidy reduction commitments for scheduled products.137
100. Second, the allocations are made on a monetary basis, which provides virtually no assurance that the United States will not surpass its quantitative export subsidy reduction commitments. This might not happen for all scheduled products in all years, but the threat that it will happen is tangible. Rice provides a good example. Based on the monetary amounts of exporter applications received for the CCC programmes, US export data, and average world prices, CCC guarantees to support US rice exports caused the United States to surpass its quantity export subsidy reduction commitments in fiscal years 2001, 2002 and 2003.138 (Even if monetary allocations were relevant, nothing limits the amount of funds that can be allocated. The CCC programmes operate without the constraints of the appropriations process, and Congress requires that CCC make available a minimum of $5.5 billion in export credit guarantees.)
101. Third, the United States' schedule demonstrates that the CCC export credit guarantees are not the only subsidies available to support exports of scheduled commodities. Combining CCC guarantees with these other export subsidies augments the threat that the United States will exceed its export subsidy reduction commitments.
102. In summary, the CCC cannot "stem[], or otherwise control[], the flow of" CCC export credit guarantees.139 None of the factors mentioned by the United States stem the flow of those guarantees, which CCC cannot decline to grant in cases where the programme conditions are met. The CCC export credit guarantee programmes therefore threaten to lead to (and in fact have led to) circumvention of the United States' export subsidy commitments, within the meaning of Article 10.1 of the Agriculture Agreement.
103. With respect to its claims under the SCM Agreement, Brazil notes that even if the CCC had the discretion not to grant export credit guarantees in cases where the programme conditions are met, it would not affect Brazil's claim that the guarantees confer benefits per se. As Brazil has discussed elsewhere, since CCC export credit guarantees from the GSM 102, GSM 103 and SCGP programmes are unique financial instruments for agricultural commodity transactions that are not available on the commercial market (certainly not for terms longer than the marketing cycles of the eligible commodities), each time they are granted, they confer benefits within the meaning of Article 1.1(b) of the SCM Agreement.
143. Brazil agrees with National Cotton Council estimates of the effects of the GSM 102 programmes (Brazil's further submission, para. 190) but it also cites a different conclusion by Prof. Sumner (paragraph 192). Brazil cites other estimates by Prof. Sumner throughout its further submission. Does Brazil adopt Prof. Sumner's conclusions and estimates as part of its submission? BRA
104. Brazil considers both the National Cotton Council's and Professor Sumner's estimates as independent parts of the record that demonstrate the serious prejudice caused by the GSM 102 programme to the interests of Brazil. The NCC has a staff of expert economists (including the former

director of the FAPRI cotton model) and has testified to Congress that the effects of the GSM 102 programme increase annual US cotton exports by 500,000 bales and have a 3-cent per pound price effect.140 Brazil has no reason to doubt the accuracy and reliability of the sworn NCC testimony to the US Congress.
105. Professor Sumner has based his analysis of the effects of the GSM 102 export credit guarantee programme on the earlier work by the National Cotton Council. Professor Sumner has modelled the impact of the GSM 102 export credit guarantee programme as a shift out of the demand curve for US upland cotton by 500,000 bales.141 Brazil believes that the resulting lower estimates of the effects of the GSM 102 programme offered by Professor Sumner are yet another illustration of the conservative (and reasonable) nature of his model.
106. In response to the Panel's Question, Professor Sumner has rerun the model analyzing the results of a fixed 500,000 bales export effect rather than a shift out of the demand curve by that amount. His original results showed an average annual 305,000 bales export-increasing effect for MY 1999-2002.142 But the assumption of a fixed 500,000 bale export-increasing effect from the GSM 102 programme results in an average world price effect between MY 1999-2002 of 0.928 cents per pound (or 1.80 per cent) compared to 0.57 cents per pound (or 1.12 per cent) estimated under the previous assumption.143 For the period MY 2003-2007 the average world price effect would be 1.07 cents per pound or 1.93 per cent compared to the 0.53 cents per pound or the 0.96 per cent estimated previously.144
107. Brazil has submitted the analysis of Professor Sumner along with results from other economists and other evidence throughout its submissions. The Panel should consider the complete record in analysing the collective effects of the US subsidies. Both the NCC's as well as Professor Sumner's studies are positive evidence of the export-enhancing and price-suppressing effects of the GSM 102 export credit guarantee programme. Both the NCC's testimony as well as Professor Sumner's original as well as revised analysis establishes that GSM 102 causes serious prejudice to the interests of Brazil, within the meaning of Articles 5(c), 6.3(c) and 6.3(d) of the SCM Agreement, and within the meaning of Articles XVI:1 and 3 of GATT 1994.
I. ACTIONABLE SUBSIDIES
145. The Panel notes that different remedies are available in respect of prohibited and actionable subsidies under Articles 4.7 and 7.8 of the SCM Agreement. If the Panel were to conclude that a subsidy was prohibited and were to make a recommendation under Article 4.7 of the SCM Agreement to withdraw the subsidy without delay, can the Panel:
(a) also conclude that the same subsidy had resulted in adverse effects to the interests of another Member? If so, what would be the value of such a conclusion in terms of the settlement of the matter before the Panel? BRA, US

141 Brazil's 9 September Further Submission, Annex I, para. 59. For reasons internal to the FAPRI model, Professor Sumner did not include the 3 cents per pound price effect estimated by the NCC in the shift out of the demand curve, thus generating more conservative results. In addition, the implicit supply and demand elasticities used by the NCC imply larger price impacts than those in the FAPRI model used by Professor Sumner, again leading to more conservative results.
142 See Exhibit Bra-301 (Additional Results from Professor Sumner's Model, Table "Impact of removal of Export Credit (fixed exports)").

144 Exhibit Bra-301 (Additional Results from Professor Sumner's Model, Table "Impact of removal of Export Credit (fixed exports)).

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-204
Brazil's Answer:
108. Regarding the first question, the Panel can conclude that prohibited subsidies have resulted in adverse effects to the interests of another Member. Article 5(c) of the SCM Agreement provides that no Member should cause serious prejudice through the use of any subsidy. That includes subsidies that are prohibited under Article 3. Nothing in the text of Articles 4.7 and 7.8 of the SCM Agreement suggests that a complaining party must make a choice between prohibited and actionable subsidy remedies. Brazil has a right to remedies provided by both provisions if the Panel makes the underlying findings that a prohibited subsidy such as Step 2 and export credit guarantees also are actionable subsidies that caused serious prejudice.
109. With respect to the second question, there will be value in the Panel making a recommendation under both Articles 4.7 and 7.8 of the SCM Agreement. A subsidy becomes a prohibited subsidy because it is contingent on exports or on the use of domestic over imported goods. If the forbidden contingency is removed, the subsidy may still cause ongoing adverse effects. In addition, there may still be continuing adverse effects from subsidies that were previously contingent on export or local content subsidies. Without a recommendation under Article 7.8, these ongoing as well as continuing adverse effects could not be remedied. Finally, recommendations on both prohibited and actionable subsidy claims may avoid later complications in the event of an appeal of the Panel's final determination.
110. Thus, Brazil urges the panel to make first a recommendation under Article 4.7 of the SCM Agreement that the Step 2, as well as GSM 102, GSM 103 and SCGP export credit guarantee programmes be withdrawn without delay. The Panel should also make a recommendation that the United States remove the adverse effects of the Step 2 and GSM 102 export credit guarantee programmes under Article 7.8 of the SCM Agreement.
(b) take into account the effects of the interaction of those prohibited subsidies with other, allegedly, actionable subsidies? If so, how is this relevant to the issue of causation under Article 5 of the SCM Agreement? BRA, US
Brazil's Answer:
111. With respect to the first question, the text of Article 5 of the SCM Agreement provides that "[n]o Member should cause, through the use of any subsidy referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 of Article 1, adverse effects". The clear intention is for panels to take into account in assessing adverse effects any and all subsidies that are specific, including those found to be prohibited under Article 3. The only subsidies excluded are those that are not specific. The ban on adverse effects also embraces adverse effects caused by the interaction between all actionable subsidy programmes.
112. Because the Panel is required to examine all actionable subsidies in making its causation determination, it is not appropriate for it to separately analyze the individual effects of each subsidy. Thus, the Panel should look at the interaction of the various types of subsidies at issue and at their collective effects. No attribution of the effects to individual subsidies or to prohibited and "other" actionable subsidies is necessary because the remedies of Articles 4.7 and 7.8 of the SCM Agreement are not contradictory.
113. Even if the Panel were to decide that it would be appropriate to examine individual effects of subsidies, Brazil has produced extensive evidence of the link between the serious prejudice caused

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-205
and the individual and collective effects of all of the actionable subsidies.145 If the Panel chooses to examine the individual instead of the collective effects of some of the US subsidies, it can do so based on the evidence produced by Brazil.146 This evidence establishes causation whether the subsidies are examined individually or collectively. With respect to the interactive effects of the various US subsidies, please see Brazil's Answer to Questions 146.
146. Brazil acknowledges that there are some interaction effects that may increase or decrease the overall effects of the subsidies (Brazil's further submission, para. 225). How would your analysis under Articles 5(c) and 6.3 of the SCM Agreement and Article XVI of GATT 1994 differ if it excluded, for example, crop insurance subsidies, PFC and/or direct payments? BRA
Brazil's Answer:
114. The evidence in the record is more than sufficient to establish present and threat of significant price suppression, increasing world market share, and inequitable share of world export trade even if PFC/direct payments and crop insurance subsidies were not deemed to be actionable subsidies.
115. In response to the Panel's question, Brazil asked Professor Sumner to use his model described in Annex I to Brazil's 9 September Further Submission to eliminate the effects of all subsidies except the PFC/direct payment and crop insurance subsidies. Professor Sumner's analysis examined the effects of the remaining US subsidies with respect to a number of factors such as planted acreage, production, US price, adjusted world price etc. The complete set of results is set forth in Exhibit Bra301.147 Brazil describes the interactive effects of all US subsidies except crop insurance and PFC/direct payments on US export and world A-Index prices below.
116. Analyzing the results for the MY 1999-2002 period from Exhibit Bra-301 shows that but for the payments from all US subsidy programmes (except the PFC and crop insurance), US exports would have fallen by 36.81 per cent and the world A-Index prices would have increased on average by 11.00 per cent (or 5.73 cents per pound). When crop insurance and PFC/direct payments are included in the original analysis, US exports fall by 41.17 per cent and A-Index world prices would increase by 12.55 per cent (6.5 cents per pound).148
117. When the period for MY 2003-2007 is examined, eliminating all subsidies except for crop insurance and direct payments means that, on average, US exports would fall by 37.31 per cent and the A-Index world price would increase by 8.36 per cent (4.63 cents per pound).149 By comparison, when all US subsidies (including PFC/direct payment and crop insurance) are eliminated, US exports, on average, would decrease by 44.02 per cent and the A-Index price would increase by 10.80 per cent.150

146 The collective and individual effects of the various US subsidies are analyzed by Professor Sumner at Tables 1.5(a) ­ (e) of Annex I to Brazil's 9 September Further Submission. See also Brazil's 9 September Further Submission, Sections 3.3.4.7 (individual effects) and 3.3.4.8 (collective effects).

118. Brazil notes that most of its evidence does not involve proof regarding PFC/direct payments or crop insurance and would, therefore, not be impacted by the assumption in the Panel's question. In addition, many of the econometric analysis cited by Brazil focus on only some of the subsidies challenged by Brazil. The results of these studies are consistent with the findings of Professor Sumner's analysis set out in Annex I to Brazil's 9 September Further Submission and Exhibit Bra301. In sum, even ignoring the effects of the crop insurance and PFC / direct payment programmes, the US subsidies cause serious prejudice to the interests of Brazil, within the meaning of Articles 5(c), 6.3(c) and (d) and GATT Articles XVI:1 and 3.
148. How should the significance of price suppression or depression be assessed under Article 6.3(c) of the SCM Agreement? In terms of a meaningful effect? Or another concept? BRA, US
Brazil's Answer:
119. The significance of price suppression should be assessed by reference to whether it meaningfully affects producers or suppliers of the same product that receives the benefits of the challenged subsidies.151 Price suppression that does not meaningfully affect suppliers or producers of a product cannot give rise to serious prejudice, since it would not be significant. The text of Article 6.3 does not set a numerical limit on the level of price suppression. What renders price suppression significant or insignificant is whether or not it causes adverse effects to the producers or suppliers of the Member(s) concerned, not whether an arbitrary level of numeric significance is achieved.152
120. Contrary to the US arguments, there is not an artificial distinction between whether price suppression is "significant" and whether such levels of suppression meaningfully affect suppliers or producers of the product receiving the benefits of the subsidies. Brazil provided considerable evidence setting forth how its producers suffered adverse effects from the levels of price suppression that can be attributed to US subsidies during MY 1999-2002.153 A good example of the significance of the levels of price suppression demonstrated by Brazil for MY 2000-2001 is found in the testimony of Christopher Ward. He indicated that a 10-per cent increase in prices for Mato Grosso producers in MY 2000 and MY 2001 would have permitted them to cover their variable costs for MY 2001 and come close to covering variable costs in MY 2000.154 However, because of the losses they suffered without such revenue increases, many Mato Grosso producers reduced production or were forced out of cotton production ­ Mato Grosso production fell by 34 per cent between MY 2000-2001.155
121. The record shows that the adverse effects suffered by Brazilian producers have also been suffered by producers in Africa.156 Nicolas Minot testified for Benin at the hearing on 8 October. His econometric analysis focused on the effect of lower upland cotton prices on poverty among Benin cotton farmers. Based on his economic analysis, a ten per cent decrease in upland cotton prices drove

152 See also New Zealand's 1 October Further Third Party Submission, paras. 2.21-2.27, tying the analysis of significance under Article 6.3(c) to the notion of serious prejudice to the Member(s) concerned under Article 5(c).

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-207
approximately 83,500 Benin upland cotton farmers below the poverty line.157 The evidence that African producers have suffered adverse effects by reason of the effects of the US subsidies confirms and supports the evidence presented by Brazil that its producers are suffering adverse effects as well.
122. But even if the Panel decides to adopt some sort of numerical standard not reflected in the text of Article 6.3(c), Brazil has also set forth evidence showing that the levels of price suppression found by a number of different economists are "significant".158 In assessing whether the various levels of price suppression found by USDA and other economists are "significant," the Panel should take into account the fact that upland cotton is a primary commodity traded in huge volumes and produced and consumed in a large number of countries. Under these circumstances, any measurable and identifiable effect on the world price from the subsidies provided by a single Member is important. In this case, the Panel is not faced with a difficult decision because during MY 1999-2002 ­ and even during MY 1997-1998 ­ the record shows that the absolute numerical levels of price suppression caused by some or all of the US subsidies were significant, ranging from 4 to 26.3 per cent of the world price, and 10 to 33.6 per cent of the US price.159
153. Would the conditions in Article 6.3(d) of the SCM Agreement be satisfied in respect of time periods other than the one specified? What relevance, if any, would this have for Brazil's claims? BRA
Brazil's Answer:
123. Brazil has demonstrated that the conditions of Article 6.3(d) of the SCM Agreement are fulfilled for MY 2001, 2002 and 2003.160 The record indicates that the conditions of Article 6.3(d) of the SCM Agreement would also have been fulfilled for MY 1999 and 2000. In addition, the increase in the US share of the world upland cotton market follows a consistent trend. This consistent trend exists whether the Panel analyzes the trend over the period MY 1996-present (described by USDA as constituting a significant change in US farm policy161) or over the period MY 1986-present (since the introduction of the marketing loan programme for upland cotton162).
124. The US world market share in MY 2000 was 24.7 per cent, an increase over the previous three-year average (MY 1997-1999) of 23.2 per cent.163 Similarly, the US market share in MY 1999 was 24.1 per cent, an increase over the previous three-year average (MY 1997-1998) of 23.4 per cent.164
125. Further, if the "time period" for assessing a "consistent trend" was changed from 1996-2003 to 1985-2003, the results would not be different. The following figure demonstrates that the increase in the US world market share also follows a consistent trend since MY 1986.165
157 Benin's 8 October Oral Statement (Statement of Nicolas Minot, para. 24-25) (estimating that a 40 per cent reduction in price caused 334,000 people to fall below the poverty line, and indicating that smaller reductions in the cotton price cause roughly proportional changes in income, as shown in Table 3 of his paper attached to Benin's 1 October Further Third Party Submission).

126. The trend line beginning in MY 1986 in the graph above shows an overall consistent increase of US export market share over an 18-year period. This steady long-term increase coincides with the introduction of the marketing loan programme in MY 1986. Another highly trade distortive subsidy, the Step 2 payments, was introduced in MY 1990. The combination of these two subsidies, along with the other trade-distortive subsidies, played an important role in the progressive increase in US world market share over the long-term period covered by the MY 1986-2003 graph above. Thus, looking at all the trends collectively provides corroborating evidence that the large increases in the US world market share from MY 1998 to the present are caused, in significant part, by the US subsidies, in violation of Articles 5(c) and 6.3(d) of the SCM Agreement.
127. Brazil notes that MY 1998 was an unusual year with a relatively low US world market share as a direct result of a 20-per cent abandonment of upland crop acreage due to weather-related issues.166 But for those weather-related problems, the US world market share would have been higher in MY 1998.
128. Finally, Brazil wishes to correct a typographical error in its calculation of the US world market share for MY 1997. The correct market share (as reflected in Figure 26 of Brazil's 9 September Further Submission) is 27.6 per cent, rather than 19.8 per cent,167 as was incorrectly noted in Exhibit Bra-206. Brazil notes that this typographical error did not affect the calculations of the increase in the US world market share.168 Correcting for this error, Brazil resubmits the corrected figures:
166 See US 30 September Further Submission, para. 19. 167 The error results from a typographical error in the line of the "total world exports", which were 26.7 million bales in MY 1997 and not 36.7 million bales, as erroneously included in the calculation. 168 Brazil notes that Figure 26 of Brazil's 9 September Further Submission is unaffected by this data error and shows a very similar trend in the US world market share in cotton.

129. As the Panel can see, all three graphs show a trend line that matches the actual curve even better than the trend line presented by Brazil in its 9 September graphs. Also, all trend lines show that there is a dramatically increasing US world market share in upland cotton, in violation of Article 6.3(d) of the SCM Agreement.

161. Would a finding of serious prejudice under Article 5(c) of the SCM Agreement be determinative for a finding under Article XVI:1 of the GATT 1994? Why or why not? What, if any, is the role of footnote 13 of the SCM Agreement in this context? BRA, US

Brazil's Answer:
130. A finding of serious prejudice based on the effects described in SCM Article 6.3(a), (b), (c) or (d) would be determinative for a finding under GATT Article XVI:1. GATT Article XVI:1 concerns measures that are (i) subsidies, and which (ii) cause or threaten serious prejudice to the interests of any other Member. Footnote 13 of the SCM Agreement provides that "[t]he term `serious prejudice to the interests of another Member' is used in this Agreement in the same sense as it is used in paragraph 1 of Article XVI of GATT 1994, and includes threat of serious prejudice". Footnote 13 clarifies that the instances that constitute serious prejudice within the meaning of the SCM Agreement, including Article 5(c), constitute at the same time serious prejudice within the meaning of GATT Article XVI:1. In addition, if the Panel determines that a particular measure is a "subsidy" under Articles 1 and 2 of the SCM Agreement, that measure would constitute ipso facto a subsidy for the purposes of GATT Article XVI:1. In sum, Articles 5(c) and 6.3 of the SCM Agreement operationalize and clarify the meaning of serious prejudice as contained in GATT Article XVI:1.172
163. Are US cotton producers able to cover the fixed and variable costs without subsidies? Please provide substantiating evidence. Of what relevance is this, if any, to Brazil's actionable subsidy claims ? US, BRA
171 Exhibit Bra-302 (Revised and Extended Data on Article 6.3(d) claim). 172 This interpretation of the relationship between Articles 5(c) and 6.3 of the SCM Agreement and GATT Article XVI:1 is without prejudice to the continued relevance of GATT Article XVI:3, as discussed in Brazil's answers to Question 185.

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-211
Brazil's Answer:
131. Brazil has established in paragraphs 117-123 of its 9 September Further Submission that between MY 1997-2002, US upland cotton producers on average were not able to cover their total cost of production, i.e., the sum of fixed and variable costs.173 The gap between the total cost of production and the revenue generated from both upland cotton lint and cottonseed increased steadily from 2.66 cents per pound in MY 1997 to 39 cents per pound in MY 2001 before falling slightly to 34.38 cents per pound in MY 2002.174 On a percentage basis, the average total costs to produce a pound of upland cotton in the United States between MY 1999-2002 were 77 per cent higher than the average market prices received by US farmers.175
132. Similarly, the Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy in Minneapolis found in a study entitled "United States Dumping on World Agricultural Markets" that based on USDA cost of production data, the United States exported its upland cotton below its total cost of production in each year between MY 1990-2001. The study found that US upland cotton was exported between 9 and 57 per cent below the total cost of production.176 This evidence on export prices is entirely consistent with Brazil's analysis of the gap between total cost of production and farm prices.177
133. Further, Brazil has used USDA data and the FAPRI 2003 baseline projections on prices and costs of production to analyze the likely gap between total costs of production and market revenues.178 Based on this information, the gap between total cost of production and market returns to producers of upland cotton will be between 24.85 cents per pound in MY 2003 and 21.85 cents per pound in MY 2007.179
134. Thus, US producers were not able to meet their total cost of production since MY 1997, and based on USDA and FAPRI baselines, they will not be able to meet their total cost of production through MY 2007. This means that US upland cotton producers would not have met their cost of production for 11 consecutive years absent large US Government subsidies. The average gap between the total cost of production and market return in those eleven years will be 22.85 cents per pound.180 The only possible conclusion is that many US producers and much US production could not exist without US subsidies, as confirmed by the National Cotton Council.181
135. The consistently large cost-revenue gap, among other factors, establishes the link between US subsidies and increased and maintained high levels of US production and exports. Given the high cost of production that significantly exceeds market revenues, absent the US subsidies, many US
173 See also Brazil's Answer to Question 125 (2) (c). 174 Exhibit Bra-205 (Costs and Returns of US Upland Cotton Producers). 175 See Exhibit Bra-205 (Costs and Revenues of US Upland Cotton Producers). The number represents the gap between the cost of production of cotton lint and the price received by producers for cotton lint. It does not take into account cottonseed revenue that would slightly narrow the gap. 176 Exhibit Bra-212 ("United States Dumping on World Agricultural Markets," Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy, p. 21). 177 Farm prices are somewhat lower than export prices. 178 Brazil's 9 September Further Submission, paras. 353-359. 179 Exhibit Bra-205 (Costs and Returns of US Upland Cotton Producers). 180 In such a situation it is materially irrelevant whether US producers met their variable cost of production. Meeting at least the variable cost of production may be a short-term option for farmers to stay in business. However, over the long-run, farmers need to cover their total cost of production. Not covering total cost of production for eleven consecutive years would certainly force any producer in any industry out of business. 181 Exhibit Bra-3 (Roger Thurow / Scott Kilman, "US Subsidies Create Cotton Glut That Hurts Foreign Cotton Farms," The Wall Street Journal, 26 June 2002, p. A1) quoting Kenneth Hood, the then Chairman of the National Cotton Council as saying "cotton farmers . . . can't exist without subsidies."

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-212

producers would have to cut upland cotton production, and much upland cotton acreage would no longer be planted to upland cotton. This result is intuitively clear and is confirmed by evidence of significant production cut-backs by Mato Grosso producers (34 per cent) who are sensitive to changes in prices, as described in Christopher Ward's statement of 7 October.182 It is also confirmed by the results of many economists examining the effects of eliminating US subsidies. They found that eliminating the US subsidies that cover the US producer cost-revenue gap would result in lower US production, leading to lower US exports and higher US and world prices.183
136. The Panel has also asked for US cost data on variable and fixed costs. Brazil provides below the most recent USDA data covering the period MY 1997-2002.184 These data demonstrate that the "gross value of the US production" did not permit US upland cotton producers to cover their total costs of production. In MY 2001, the gross value of the production did not even permit them to cover their variable costs of production. In MY 2002, their revenue only covered slightly more than their variable costs. Not reflected in the chart below is the fact that US subsidies made up all (or almost all) the difference between the "gross value of the US production" and the "total costs listed" between MY 1997-2002.

J. CAUSATION

165. Please comment (and submit substantiating evidence) on the US assertion that the FAPRI model has been designed and developed for prospective analysis, and is not suitable for retrospective counterfactual analysis. What is the reliability of past FAPRI-produced analyses when compared with actual data for the period covered by them? Is there any other instrument that can be used to try to identify the effect of subsidies already granted, or of their removal? BRA, US

Brazil's Answer:

137. Concerning the first question, there is nothing inherently different in using a calibrated simulation model (the category of models into which the FAPRI and many other models fall) to investigate (i) questions of the future effects on prices and quantities of a potential change in policy or, instead, (ii) questions of how the recent pattern of prices and quantities would have been different if a different set of policies would have been in place. Calibrated simulation models, including the FAPRI model, are routinely used for both kinds of questions. The applications are identical. In one case, the comparison for the results from the counter-factual policy option is to an unobserved future baseline. In the other case, the comparison for the results from the counter-factual policy option is retrospective to past actual events.

138. The FAPRI policy simulation framework is an elaborate set of supply and demand equations (along with associated stock equations and equilibrium conditions that set quantity supplied equal to quantity demanded). The framework includes, as a component, a set of "baseline" projections of agricultural prices and quantities for future periods that are based on explicit assumptions about policy, climate, technological change, macroeconomic conditions, etc. In many applications, the relevant questions investigated by the model are of the following form: if some specific policy were different in the future, how would this affect the future outcomes for farm commodity prices and quantities. For example, this is the form of question that is often posed in the context of options for changing US farm subsidies in the future. Because they have baseline projection components, the FAPRI framework and a few others are well suited for these future-oriented questions. But the use of such models to analyze the recent past is also common whenever that is a relevant question.

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-214
139. As with other calibrated simulation models, the FAPRI model itself is also used routinely for both projections and retrospective counterfactual analysis. One recent publication that applied retrospective counterfactual analysis concerned world peanut (groundnut) policy. That study adapted the basic FAPRI framework, much as it was adapted to apply to the current case for upland cotton, to consider international peanut policy questions. The model is calibrated to three recent years ­ 1999/2000, 2000/2001 and 2001/2002 ­ and examines a peanut trade liberalization scenario.185
140. A second recent retrospective counterfactual application was to the US sugar programme in a project conducted for the US General Accounting Office. In that analysis, a version of the FAPRI domestic sugar model was combined with the CARD international sugar model (much as Professor Sumner has done for upland cotton, as reported in Annex I to Brazil's 9 September Further Submission). The model was calibrated to 1999 data, and results considered the effects of policy reform relative to the 1999 crop year actual outcomes.186
141. In addition, Brazil notes that USDA has frequently used calibrated simulation models to perform retrospective, counterfactual analysis. For example, USDA economists calibrated the USDA "SWOPSIM" model, which was used extensively to analyze trade policy options in the 1980s and 1990s, to 1989 data and solved it for commodity prices and quantities that would have obtained in that year under alternative trade liberalization scenarios.187
142. The USDA "FAPSIM" model, which is quite similar to the FAPRI model, is a calibrated simulation model that is also used for retrospective counterfactual analysis and for considering policy options relative to projections. According to J. Michael Price of the USDA Economic Research Service, who was one of the developers of the model and currently maintains and operates the model, it is calibrated to historical data each year as well as to the official USDA baseline. That model is used for responding to questions about future policy options and to retrospective counterfactual questions. Indeed, one of the first published applications of the "FAPSIM" model was a retrospective counterfactual analysis of US grain storage policy.188
143. One of the most recent applications of the USDA "FAPSIM" model was to respond to requests for both alternative projections and retrospective counterfactual analysis from the Commission on the Application of Payment Limitations for Agriculture. These results, which have been discussed in previous submissions by Brazil, used the FAPSIM policy framework.189
144. According to the Commission Report (chaired by the Chief USDA Economist):
"Westcott and Price analyzed the effects of eliminating marketing loans on production and prices of major crops over the period from 1998 through 2005. The

baseline used for the analysis was the USDA 2000 baseline, which did not anticipate the sharp decline in cotton price for 2001 crop year."190
...
"The Commission requested that the above study be updated to take into account the sharp decline in cotton prices for the 2001 crop (Westcott). The updated analysis indicated that elimination of marketing loan benefits for the 2001 crop would have lowered cotton acreage by 2.5 to 3.0 million acres or 15-20 per cent and reduced rice acreage by 300,000 acres or 10 per cent."191
145. Finally, there are literally hundreds of other academic and government studies using a variety of models calibrated on retrospective data that analyze policy questions. All computable general equilibrium models use this approach, and most academic partial equilibrium simulation models do so as well.
146. Concerning the second question, it is difficult to determine the reliability of the analysis of potential (i.e., future) policy outcomes because ­ by definition ­ the baseline approach will not mirror exactly the actual conditions. This is why baseline projections use long-term data to even out inevitable fluctuations in commodity market developments. Similarly, the but for analysis of a retrospective study attempts to simulate what would have (but did not actually) occur with different policy assumptions. However, the retrospective analysis has the benefit of using actual market data and not projected benchmarks. It is, of course, possible to critique selected portions of the FAPRI baseline projections if they are treated as forecasts of the future values for prices and quantities. Against this benchmark, the FAPRI projections ­ like all others ­ will sometimes miss future movements in commodity markets.
147. One measure of the reliability of the FAPRI baseline is that the FAPRI model continues to be relied upon regularly by a variety of US government and US industry organizations to guide decisions on important policy questions. USDA even provided the FAPRI economists with their highest award based on the 2002 baseline analysis.192 In addition, FAPRI economists over the years have performed checks to ensure that the FAPRI model is as reliable as possible. For example, observed (actual) planted acreage has generally responded in the directions the model projects when the loan rates and other driving factors are relatively constant. In addition, FAPRI constantly examines the internal consistency of the model and its economic logic when compared to actual market events and conditions and makes appropriate adjustments, as necessary.
148. Concerning the third question, there are a number of other potential simulation modelling frameworks that can be used as instruments to respond to retrospective counterfactual policy questions. The USDA FAPSIM model is one such framework. It was used, for example, in the Westcott/Price analysis of the effect of removing all marketing loan payments for MY 2000 and MY 2001.193 However, the FAPSIM model does not have a full international cotton model as used in the
190 Exhibit Bra-276 (Report of the Commission on the Application of Payment Limitations for Agriculture, August 2003, p. 124).

FAPRI/CARD framework, and thus would be less appropriate for dealing with the world price aspects of this case. In general, for specific questions about how quantities and prices of upland cotton would have been different but for US upland cotton subsidies, the appropriate models with which Brazil is familiar would all follow the same basic simulation framework as the FAPRI model.
167. How does Brazil react to Exhibit US-44? BRA
Brazil's Answer:
149. The United States claims that Exhibit US-44 demonstrates the "disconnect between the decline in cotton prices ... and the incentive offered by US marketing loans."194 But all that Exhibit US-44 does is to show monthly A-Index prices for upland cotton. These prices, as with other primary agricultural commodities, move up and down with large swings. This exhibit provides no insight into the link between US producer's decisions to keep planting upland cotton as upland cotton prices (including A-Index prices) move up and down. Further, the quantity of subsidies provided by the US marketing loan is a function of the difference between the loan rate (currently 52 cents per pound) and the adjusted world price (AWP) for upland cotton ­ not the A-Index price.195 As the Panel can see from the chart provided in response to Question 181, the AWP is consistently and considerably below the A-Index.
150. A relevant graph to examine the causal link between US subsidies and US production is one with a horizontal line representing the marketing loan rate, and which compares that line against the AWP, which is the basis for the payment of marketing loans. This is illustrated in the graph below:196

151. This graph shows first what the Exhibit US-44 neglected to illustrate ­ that except for a short period in MY 2000, the AWP was below the loan rate throughout all of MY 1999-2002, and that marketing loan payments corresponding to the difference between the AWP and the loan rate were

made. All of the dark area below the 52 cents line represents marketing loan subsidies paid to US upland cotton producers. This illustrates US producers' indifference to market prices. To paraphrase the United States, the line of 52 cents per pound illustrates a "disconnect," but it is not one between the A-Index price and US subsidies. Rather, this graph illustrates the disconnect between the AWP (and more importantly, the US price received by upland cotton producers) and the acreage and production response of US producers: even when prices go to record lows, US producers' revenue is insulated from the decline. This revenue not only kept them in production, but it allowed them to increase production during MY 1999-2001. And more remarkably, it kept many of the producers planting 14.2 million acres of cotton when the AWP was near record lows in the period from February-June 2002. These low prices during the crucial planting decision period are clearly reflected in the figure above.197 It was this period that USDA economists Westcott and Price examined and found that but for the marketing loan payments in MY 2001, US upland cotton production would be 2.5-3 million bales less than it actually was.
152. Thus, this graph helps explain why there is such a limited response from high-cost US upland cotton producers to changes in upland cotton prices. Of course, the graph above does not represent the full amount of revenue supplied by all US subsidies. Other programme features and other programmes provide additional subsidies that cause the effective per unit revenue guarantee to be much higher than the loan rate.
153. If the purpose of Exhibit US-44 was to demonstrate the absence of a link between US upland cotton production (and price suppression) and US marketing loan payments, then it flies in the face of the findings of USDA's own economists. Brazil has referenced the testimony of USDA's chief economist, among many other USDA economists, who have candidly acknowledged the enormous production and price effects that US marketing loan subsidies have on stimulating and maintaining large amounts of US upland cotton production.198
170. Brazil quotes a report that states that a 10 per cent increase in soybean prices reduces upland cotton acreage by only 0.25 per cent (Brazil's 7 October oral statement, para. 27). Could Brazil indicate if this analysis is done on a short-run basis or a long-run basis? BRA
Brazil's Answer:
154. The authors of the USDA study cited by Brazil ­ USDA economists Westcott and Meyer ­ use a "modified version of the estimated elasticities from Lin et al.,"199 which Westcott/Meyer refer to as a technical improvement. The original study by Lin et al. appears to estimate short to medium-run elasticities. Lin et al. use what they describe as "new supply response elasticities . . . in short-term, acreage forecasting applications".200 For the estimation of the elasticities themselves, Lin et al. use two models that are solved by regression analysis of the effect of expected relative price changes between crops and the resulting acreage effects in the two following years.201
197 See Brazil's 7 October Oral Statement, paras. 32-33. 198 Brazil's 9 September Further Submission, paras. 148-161. See further Brazil's 7 October Oral Statement, paras 31-34. 199 Exhibit Bra-275 ("US Cotton Supply Response Under the 2002 Farm Act," Westcott and Meyer, USDA, 21 February 2003, p. 9). Brazil is not in a position to specify in which sense the estimated elasticities are modified. 200 Exhibit Bra-306 ("Supply Response under the 1996 Farm Act and Implications for the US Field Crops Sector," Lin et al., USDA, July 2000, p. 2). 201 Exhibit Bra-306 ("Supply Response under the 1996 Farm Act and Implications for the US Field Crops Sector," Lin et al., USDA, July 2000, p. 9-16).

155. Lin et al. present their results in Table 21 of their study.202 It appears that the resulting estimates of the acreage price elasticities are short or medium-term elasticities (acreage reaction one to three years in the future), and that the adaptations by Westcott and Meyer are also short to mediumterm elasticities.203 172. Please estimate the price effect, in cents per pound, of the growth in the US retail market which it is said has directly contributed to strengthening world cotton prices. US Brazil's Comment: 156. Brazil emphasizes that its claims under Article 6.3(c) of the SCM Agreement revolve around the present and threatened suppression of prices. Thus, whether world upland cotton prices are strengthening or weakening is irrelevant to the question whether those prices would have been higher (at any price level) but for the US subsidies. 176. With reference to Figure 4 of Brazil's Further Submission, how does Brazil explain the apparent decrease in prices in 2001 and the increase of the A-Index in recent months, despite the continued use of US subsidies on upland cotton? BRA
Brazil's Answer: 157. Brazil has consistently argued that over the period of investigation (MY 1999-2002), the US subsidies caused price suppression that was significant when A-Index prices declined and when AIndex prices increased both during and near the end of the period of investigation in mid-2003.204 As Brazil explained at the meeting on 7 October 2003, A-Index prices rise and fall for a variety of supply and demand reasons.205 One of the reasons that prices fell as low as they did in MY 1999-2001 and did not rise as far as they should have in MY 2002 was due to the US subsidies. This is best illustrated in Figure 14, set out in Brazil's 9 September Further Submission and reproduced below:
202 Exhibit Bra-306 ("Supply Response under the 1996 Farm Act and Implications for the US Field Crops Sector," Lin et al., USDA, July 2000, p. 60).
203 Due to the adaptations, the elasticities reported by Westcott and Meyer are not identical to those reported by Lin et al.

158. This figure represents Professor Sumner's findings, but a similar figure could be reproduced to reflect other levels of price suppression ­ including the 33.6 per cent suppression of US prices found by USDA's own economists for MY 2001,207 as well as the ICAC and other international organizations' findings of price suppression caused by US subsidies for upland cotton.208 Professor
Sumner's findings indicate that during MY 1999-2002, there were a number of global supply and
demand factors (including $12.9 billion in US subsidies) that caused upland cotton prices to fall and remain at low levels compared to historical prices throughout the period of investigation. The upper
line on the graph reflects the contribution of the $12.9 billion in US subsidies to keeping A-Index
prices suppressed. The area below the upper line and above the darker area reflects the amount of
price suppression. In other words, regardless of whether market prices rise or fall, there is always a
price-suppressive effect.

159. With respect to the Panel's specific question regarding the effects of US subsidies in the latter
half of MY 2002, the record shows that US and A-Index prices rose in MY 2002 for a number of supply and demand factors ­ many of which also impacted the market during the fall of prices in MY
1999-2001. The most important supply factor was the decline in production of 1.71 million tons in
MY 2001-2002 by non-US producers such as the African Franc zone, Southern Africa, East Asia, South Asia, and the former Soviet Union countries.209 The evidence suggests that many of these
producers could not maintain existing levels of production at lower prices that existed in MY 2001
and MY 2002. For example, Christopher Ward testified that even though Brazilian Mato Grosso
producers had extremely high yields and low costs, they were forced by low prices to cut their
production by 34 per cent in 2001 and by 25 per cent in 2002, compared with 2000 production levels.210 Similarly, Mr. Ibrahim Malloum, President of CottonChad, testified that lower prices in MY

206 A-Index prices with and without subsidies are based the baseline and the change from the baseline
as reflected in the results of Professor Sumner's simulation model. See Brazil's 9 September Further
Submission, Annex I, Table I.5a. 207 Brazil's 7 October Oral Statement, para. 32-33. 208 See Brazil's 9 September Further Submission, paras. 148-162 (discussing price suppressing effects
of marketing loan payments including Figure 11 at paragraph 160), para. 190 (NCC estimates of 3 cent per

2001-02 meant that Chadian production fell because producers could not afford inputs such as fertilizer.211
160. For US producers at the time of planting for the MY 2002 crop ­ between January-April 2002 ­ the AWP and US price received by US producers were near record lows.212 Faced with an annual 39 cents per pound differential between total costs and such prices in MY 2001, US cotton producers still planted 14.2 million acres of upland cotton for MY 2002.213 The resulting US production in MY 2002 was 16.73 million bales (or 3.64 million metric tons). This is an extraordinary amount of acreage and production given the huge gap between US producers' costs and expected market revenue. It is estimated that without US subsidies, US production in MY 2002 would have been approximately 1.92 million metric tons, or 1.72 million metric tons less than what US upland cotton farmers actually produced.214 The effects of this additional 1.72 million metric tons of subsidygenerated production can be judged from the effects of an actual decline in world supply of 2.365 million metric tons215, which contributed to an increase in A-Index prices of 33 per cent between MY 2001 and MY 2002.216 If an additional 1.72 million metric tons of US production were taken out of world supply, prices would have been even higher. Professor Sumner has indicated that A-Index prices in MY 2002 would have increased by 17.70 per cent absent the US subsidies.217 Thus, the effect of the US subsidies in MY 2002 ­ even as prices increased ­ was to suppress prices.
178. The Panel notes Exhibit US-63. Could the US please provide a conceptually analogous graph concerning US export sales during the same period? US
Brazil's Comment:
161. Brazil offers a conceptually analogous figure to Exhibit US-63 concerning US and rest-ofthe-world export sales. The figure below shows the relative changes in US and non-US exports as compared to the previous year for the period MY 1997-2002, based on data covering the period MY 1996-2002.218

162. The figure demonstrates that US exports increased in every year except for MY 1998, during which the United States claims it suffered a major crop failure. In addition, US exports increased in all years, except for MY 1998, more than exports from non-US producers, which since MY 2000 even decreased continuously. The figure demonstrates that the United States gains world market share, with its own exports increasing since MY 1999, at the expense of non-US exports, which have fallen since MY 2000.
163. In sum, this figure supports Brazil's claim of serious prejudice under Articles 5(c) and 6.3(d) of the SCM Agreement. It also supports Brazil's claim of serious prejudice under Articles XVI:1 and 3 of GATT 1994 because the USshare of world export trade increased, in significant part, by the US subsidies at the expense of other lower-cost producers.
179 Could Brazil comment on the argument that decoupled payments and other subsidies to upland cotton are largely being capitalized into land values and that removing these subsidies would reduce the cost of production of upland cotton producers (US 7 October oral statement, para. 48). What would be the net effect of these adjustments? BRA
Brazil's Answer:
164. A February 2003 study by ERS economists estimated that "decoupled" payments lead to an increase of about 8 per cent in US farmland values.219 A more comprehensive ERS 2001 report estimating the regional effects of all subsidies (not just decoupled subsidies) on land values found that land values increased by 16 per cent in the regions where upland cotton is grown. This is shown in the following chart:220

219 Exhibit Bra-308 ("Decoupled Payments: Household Income Transfers in Contemporary US
Agriculture," ERS Agricultural Economic Report No. 822). 220 Exhibit Bra-309 (Barnard C., Nehring, R., Ryan, J., Collender, R. "Higher Cropland Value from

165. Brazil notes that neither of these studies provides an estimate of the percentage of each dollar
of "decoupled" or total subsidy payments that are capitalized into land values. However, an
August 2003 study by ERS economists indicates that PFC payments in MY 1997 resulted in an increase of land rents by 34-41 cents of per PFC dollar.221 Thus, contrary to the premise of the
Panel's question, this evidence suggests that PFC payments are somewhat, but not "largely capitalized" into land rents.

166. There would be only a minimal impact on total costs of production for upland cotton farmers
from the removal of both "decoupled" and total US subsidies. For the allegedly "de-coupled"
payments referred to in the February 2003 ERS study, the impact of an 8 per cent reduction in land
values translates into a decrease in total costs of US upland cotton producers by less than one per cent (0.75 per cent).222 If the effects on increased land values from all subsidies are taken into account
(using the 2001 ERS regional study), then US upland cotton producers' costs would have declined between MY 1999-2002 by only 1.49 per cent.223 In response to the Panel's question, the net effect of
these tiny adjustments throughout MY 1999-2002 on the very wide cost-revenue gap and the other
costs of production analysis conducted by Brazil in its various submissions is obviously minimal.

167. Finally, the United States at paragraph 48 of its 7 October Oral Statement criticized Professor
Sumner's analysis for allegedly not factoring into his estimates the effect of direct payments being
capitalized into increased land rents. The US criticism is misplaced. Professor Sumner's model used
very low estimates of production incentives for every dollar of PFC payments (only 15 per cent) and direct payments (only 25 per cent).224 By taking a very conservative approach for these direct
payments, Professor Sumner's analysis more than allows for the effects these payments have in
increasing land values. This can be illustrated by using the 34-41 per cent results of the August 2003
land rent study referred to above. The results of this study suggest that 66-59 cents of each PFC
dollar are not reflected in increased rents. This leaves more than enough residue from each PFC and
direct payment dollar to account for the only 15-25 per cent production effects for PFC/direct payments found by Professor Sumner.225

Brazil's Answer:
168. Brazil looks forward to receiving a detailed description of the complicated calculation of the adjusted world price from the United States in reply to this question. Brazil has set forth a brief description of the calculation of the adjusted world price in paragraph 73 of its 24 June First Submission, and will elaborate to the best of its understanding.
169. The details of the complicated calculation method for the adjusted world price are laid down in 7 CFR 1427.25.226 The weekly Cotton Outlook published by Cotlook Ltd. provides a somewhat simpler description of the process. Exhibit Bra-51 includes the Cotton Outlook description of the "US Pricing Mechanism", including the calculation of the adjusted world price for the week of 31 January 2002.227
170. The descriptions shows that the adjusted world price is calculated based on the A-Index from which a total adjustment factor is subtracted, thus:
The Adjusted World Price (AWP) is calculated from CIF North Europe quotations, adjusted for shipping, location and quality differentials. The Shipping Differential is derived from the average over the preceding 52 weeks, or as many of that number of weeks for which quotations are available, of the difference, calculated from Thursday's values only, between the average of the Memphis and California/Arizona CIF North Europe quotations, and the Middling 1-3/32" (31-35) domestic spot market average. However, the Shipping Differential in any week may not fall below, or rise above 115 per cent, of an assessed actual transportation cost (now 12.9 cent). A further discount, the Course Count Adjustment, is applied by reference to the amount by which the World Quality difference exceeds the appropriate Loan Quality Difference. It applies to cotton of any grade stapling 1-1/32" or shorter, and to selected lower grades in longer staples.228
171. Brazil also notes that under certain conditions, the Secretary of Agriculture is entitled to reduce the adjusted world price below the result of this calculation ­ the so-called Step 1 adjustment. In such circumstances, the adjusted world price would be reduced by a maximum of the difference between the A-Index and the average of the cheapest US Middling 1-3/32" CIF North Europe quotes ­ thus, the amount by which the US price quotes exceed the average of the five cheapest price quotes worldwide. Such a downward adjustment would increase the amount of marketing loan payments that US upland cotton farmers receive and help close the cost-revenue gap that US producers face.
181. Please provide a side-by-side chart of the weekly US adjusted world price, the Liverpool A-Index, the NY futures price, and spot market prices from 1996-present. What, if anything, does this reveal? BRA, US Brazil's Answer:
172. In Brazil Bra-311, Brazil provides a side-by-side chart of the weekly US AWP, the A-Index, the nearby New York futures price, the average US spot market price and prices received by US producers from January 1996 to the present. The figure below shows the respective price developments over this period. Exhibit Bra-311 also contains a colour copy of this chart.229

Adjusted World Price NY Futures Weekly Average of US Spot Markets Weekly Average of the A-Index Prices Received by Producers
173. The figure demonstrates that the A-Index price is consistently 12-14 cents per pound higher than the adjusted world price ("AWP"), which constitutes the basis for the US marketing loan payments. The average difference between both prices over the 1996-present period is 13.76 cents per pound. As expected, both prices move in parallel. Further, both prices follow the price trends that originate from the New York futures market or at least move in parallel to those prices. There is also a close linkage between the average US spot market price and the New York futures and A-Index prices.
174. The figure further demonstrates that the New York futures prices and the average US spot market prices are usually more volatile than the A-Index and AWP prices. Thus, any rapid increases or decreases in the New York futures prices will not necessarily be reflected to the same extent in AWP or prices received by US producers ­ the prices of which marketing loan and counter-cyclical payments, respectively, are triggered. They may just be a temporary phenomenon.
175. In sum, the price movements support Brazil's argument that New York futures, US and international prices for upland cotton are closely linked, and that price movements and trends originating from the US market are closely tracked by prices on the world markets.230
176. That US and international ­ and indeed Brazilian ­ prices closely track each other demonstrates that production and price effects from the US subsidies on the US market are transmitted to the international upland cotton market and to third country markets such as the Brazilian market or markets where Brazil exports its upland cotton. The Panel will remember that the A-Index is composed of price quotes from 16 different upland cotton export markets around the world.231 Thus, if USDA studies like those undertaken by Westcott and Price establish pricesuppressing effects of the US subsidies for the US market, those effects will also occur on the
230 See Section 3.3.4.9 of Brazil's 9 September Further Submission, para. 233-250. 231 Brazil's 9 September Further Submission, Annex II, para. 24.

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-225
international and third country markets. The parallelism in the price movements establishes the link between price suppression in the US and international markets and other third country markets.
182. Please explain why the US can be taken to be price leaders, or price setters, (and not just takers) when US producers receive large subsidy payment to support the difference between world prices and their own costs? BRA
Brazil's Answer:
177. The Panel's question focuses first on "US producers" who receive large subsidies. One of the premises of this question is that US producers receive subsidies that account for the difference between world prices and their own costs. This is not entirely correct. US producers receive what the USDA refers to as "Average price received by US producers". During the MY 1999-2002 period, this US producer price was on average 9.2 cents per pound, or 17.6 per cent, below the world A-Index price.232 Other than the first month of marketing year 1999, the A-Index price was always higher than the US price received by US producers between MY 1999-2002. The lower prices paid to US producers are partly explained by the transportation costs of upland cotton from the United States to foreign markets, where most US upland cotton is marketed. However, as the Panel's question suggests, the total revenue received by US producers includes marketing loan payments that are a function of the set loan rate (52 cents in MY 2002) and the adjusted world price that itself is determined in part by reference to the A-Index prices.
178. During MY 1999-2002, individual US producers of upland cotton did not "set" or "lead" AIndex prices. Most US producers were isolated from the effects of market price during MY 19992002. As the Panel's questions implies, on average, US producers were generally able to cover their costs based on a combination of market revenue and the large subsidies they received during MY 1999-2002.233 The guaranteed subsidies and price support at high price levels ensured a revenue stream that left them largely indifferent to market prices throughout the entire period of investigation.
179. The Panel's question further asks how the United States could be a "price setter" in the world upland cotton market. Individual US exporters of US upland cotton do not "set" or "control" the price of upland cotton. In a world-wide market such as the upland cotton market, no single private trader has the market power (in an anti-trust sense) to "set" the world price. As Andrew Macdonald testified, prices of upland cotton are discovered hourly and daily by traders in the futures, spot, and forward delivery markets based on key supply and demand factors.234 Nor has Brazil argued that the US leads prices down by initiating a price war, as may occur with industrial products.
180. What Brazil has argued is that the United States is a leading driver of the world upland cotton market to the extent it suppresses the price of upland cotton. The United States can do this because of its large guaranteed production and direct subsidies that inject a near permanent stream of large US production and supplies into the world market. US export subsidies drive the world market in the sense that they stimulate the demand for high-cost US upland cotton at the expense of other world producers. Further, its size (by far the largest exporter and second largest producer), its transparency, which in turn plays a major role in the price discovery in the New York futures market, and the ability of US exporters to use the Step 2 and GSM 102 tools to market US upland cotton, allow it to suppress world prices.235 Only by taking these price-suppressing factors into account could it be said that the United States "leads" world prices.
232 See Brazil's Answer to Question 181 for data on the A-Index prices and the prices received by US producers.
233 See Brazil's Answer to Questions 125 (2) (c) and 163. 234 Brazil's 9 September Further Submission, Annex II, paras 11-13, 15-25 and 38-42. 235 Brazil's 9 September Further Submission, paras. 134-145; Annex II, paras. 38-42 and Chad's 8 October Oral Statement (Statement of Ibrahim Malloum), para. 13-14.

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-226
181. For example, the large size of the US production, which represents approximately 20 per cent of total world supply annually, is a key factor in driving and influencing world prices.236 Shifts in US production caused by good or bad US weather influence total world supply and create an impact on world prices.237 In much the same way as US weather plays a role in the discovery of world prices (by reducing US and, thus, world stocks), continued high levels of US production generated by US subsidies suppressed world prices throughout the period of investigation by increasing world supplies.
182. Further, the dominant (over 40 per cent) export market share of the United States coupled with the Step 2 and GSM 102 export subsidies creates a further suppressing effect on world prices.238 These export subsidies allow US exporters to price their upland cotton below the prices of most other world producers because Step 2 gives them (not US producers) the difference between the lowest US price and the A-Index price (the average five lowest prices in the world market).239 These subsidies, along with the domestic production and direct payment subsidies, have permitted exporters of highcost US upland cotton to increase US world market share even as prices plunged throughout MY 1999-2001. Thus, while individual US exporters may not have "set" or "led" prices, the US subsidies allowed these exporters to continue marketing high-cost US cotton at whatever market price was determined by global supply and demand conditions.
K. ARTICLE XVI OF GATT 1994
183. Why does Brazil believe that the appropriate "previous representative period" is the term of the previous Farm Bill, MY1996-2002? (Brazil's further submission, para. 282) BRA
Brazil's Answer:
183. The Panel's question has stimulated a re-evaluation by Brazil of the appropriate "previous representative period" in relation to Article XVI:3. Brazil agrees with the US arguments made in the EEC ­ Wheat Flour GATT dispute that the appropriate "previous representative period" in Article XVI:3 should be one in which trade patterns have not been distorted by subsidies. In that dispute, the United States correctly argued:
...that the three most recent calendar years could not be used as the representative period in the case since, given the distortion of trade patterns resulting from the heavy use of export subsidies by the EEC, it did not constitute a period during which "normal market conditions existed." There was ample GATT precedent for selecting a period when subsidization was not unduly affecting the market shares. During the 1995 Review Session it was agreed that in determining what is an equitable share of world trade, the CONTRACTING PARTIES should not lose sight of the "fact that

the export subsidies in existence during the selected representative period may have influenced the share of the trade obtained by the various exporting countries." (GATT, BISD 3rd Supplement, paragraph 19, page 226). Then, in 1960, the CONTRACTING PARTIES adopted a Panel Report which dealt with notification of subsidies, in which it was agreed that an analysis of the effect of a subsidy should include statistics "... for a previous representative year, which were possible and meaningful, should be the latest period preceding the introduction of the subsidy or preceding the last major change in the subsidy." (GATT, BISD 9th Supplement, Annex II(b)(ii), page 194).... Thus, it was necessary to examine a period of which preceded the adoption of the EEC's subsidy system in order to assure that the trade distorting effect which the EEC system had already had on world markets was minimized as a factor in judging "equitable share." 240
184. There has been no period since the 1930s when US producers of upland cotton were not subsidized.241 Since the 1980s in particular, US upland cotton producers have been guaranteed very high levels of government payments by a variety of subsidies, including the marketing loan programme that began in MY 1986. The revenue guarantee that these subsidies provide has locked in large amounts of apparently permanent high-cost US upland cotton production and exports. These distortions exist even in those years in which actual quantities of payments under the programmes are minimal due to higher prices. This is because the subsidies provided to high-cost producers in years of low prices mean they stay in business to continue to produce upland cotton also at times when subsidies fall due to increased prices. The relatively small planted acreage and production response by US producers to market prices over many years reflects the effects of this guaranteed US government revenue.
185. In view of the US arguments in EEC ­ Wheat Flour and the long-term distortions in the US production and exports caused by US subsidies, one appropriate "representative period" would be a simulated period in which no subsidies were provided. The Panel would examine the question: what would be a Member's share of world trade if it received no subsidies? This question, of course, is a function first of the amount of acreage and production, and ultimately exports attributed to the subsidies. The Panel is fortunate to have the benefit of very recent 2003 analysis by USDA economists Westcott and Price, who estimated that up to 3 million US acres of upland cotton production would have not been planted in MY 2001 if no marketing loan payments were made that year. These 3 million acres represent 19.36 per cent of US upland cotton acreage in MY 2001.242 A reduction by this amount would imply a reduction in US production of 3.79 million bales for MY 2001.243 Consequently, US exports would also fall by about 3.79 million bales, representing 34.74 per cent of US exports in MY 2001.244 The implied export effects from the Westcott/Price study are very similar to those found by Professor Sumner, who estimated the export-increasing effects of the marketing loan programme in the comparable period to be 29.67 per cent and the effects of all US subsidies to increase US exports by 48.16 per cent.245
186. The record provides an example of what the US share of world export trade in upland cotton would be in a marketing year in which production and exports fell by amounts similar to those estimated by Professor Sumner and Westcott/Price. In MY 1998, 20 per cent of US upland cotton

acreage was abandoned and US harvested acreage fell by 2.8 million acres compared to MY 1997.246 US production fell by 4.77 million bales and US exports fell by 3 million bales. As a result, US world market share declined from 27.6 per cent in MY 1997 to 17.9 per cent in MY 1998.247 This considerable decrease in the US share of world export trade provides an approximation for the Panel to assess what the equitable US share would be but for the US subsidies in MY 2001-2003. Thus, MY 1998 is a useful representative period for the Panel to examine (in conjunction with Professor Sumner's and USDA economists Westcott/Price's analysis).
187. An alternative representative period that the Panel could use for assessing the inequitable nature of the US share of world export trade in upland cotton is the period MY 1994-96, during which the average level of US subsidies fell to "only" $495 million per year.248 The development of the US world market share in MY 1994-1996 compared to MY 2001-2003 is shown in the graph below:249

188. During the period 1994-1996, US producers were generally able to cover their total costs of
production largely from market revenue. In these conditions, US world market share averaged 28.4 per cent.250 Yet, in conditions where market revenue plunged, costs of production and the costrevenue gap increased. Average MY 1999-2002 US subsidies were six times greater than the period
MY 1994-96, and US world market share increased to between 38 and 41.6 per cent in MY 2001-
2002. These record high levels of world market share were purchased with large increases in both the
quantity and level of guaranteed subsidies in MY 2001-2003 ­ huge marketing loan payments as well as increases in revenue support of 10 cents a pound resulting from the 2002 FSRI Act.251 Thus, even
though the period MY 1994-1996 was still heavily influenced by the revenue guarantees provided by the numerous US upland cotton subsidy programmes, this period could be a representative period for
the Panel to examine for the purposes of making its "inequitable" share of world export trade findings.

184. Why does Brazil believe that an "equitable share" is one which factors out all subsidies? To the extent that domestic support and export subsidies are permitted by the Agreement on Agriculture, why should they not be accepted as being normal conditions in analyzing an equitable market share? (See Brazil's further submission, paras 288-289) BRA
Brazil's Answer:
189. Brazil believes, for the reasons articulated by the United States in the EEC - Wheat Flour dispute quoted in Brazil's Answer to Question 183, that the appropriate representative period for evaluating the inequitable share of share of world export trade is one in which no (or at most very few) trade-distorting subsidies were provided. Selecting an earlier representative period where the market share is not tainted with subsidies allows an assessment of whether a later market share is tainted by subsidies. As the United States argued well in EEC ­ Wheat Flour, the inequitable nature of a world market share can best be judged in comparison to what an equitable, i.e., non-heavily subsidized world market share would be. This is consistent with Brazil's arguments in paragraphs 288-289 of its 9 September Further Submission that a non-subsidized world market share of 17 per cent is, by definition, an equitable share for the purpose of Article XVI:3. By contrast, a heavily subsidized and subsidy-increased world market share of 41.6 per cent in MY 2002 is inequitable.252
190. With respect to the second question, Brazil notes that although agricultural domestic and ­ to a certain extent - export subsidies are not prohibited, GATT Article XVI places clear limits to such subsidization. Section A determines, for example, that subsidies must be notified when the operate "directly or indirectly to increase exports of any product from, to reduce imports of any product into, its territory". More specifically, it established that the subsidizing Member must avoid causing serious prejudice to the interest of other Members. Therefore, even purely domestic subsidies should only be granted in a manner that does not affect the equilibrium of world trade that would be achieved in their absence.
191. The GATT Article XVI obligations ­ especially those of the second sentence of paragraph 3 ­ are primarily focused on the effects of subsidies that operate to increase exports. Paragraph 2 places particular emphasis on the fact that such subsidies "may cause undue disturbance" to the "normal commercial interests" of other Members. Large subsidies stimulating exports cannot be understood not to cause "undue disturbance" that affect the "normal commercial interest" of other Members. Otherwise, GATT Article XVI:3 would be stripped of any meaning. If, the starting point to an analysis of an equitable share grandfathers subsidies that were being previously granted, such analysis would start from an inequitable situation of equilibrium.
192. The term "equitable" is defined as something that is "characterized by equity or fairness; fair, just."253 "Equitable" does not relate to something that is "legal" or "permitted." Something that is permitted may well be not equitable. The fact that certain subsidies are "permitted" does not grandfather their effects and transforms them into "normal conditions in analyzing an equitable market share," as put by the Panel in this question. The text of GATT Article XVI:3 requires that the test of "equitable" market share be primarily and intrinsically linked with the concept of fairness. Therefore, an "equitable" analysis of a fair equilibrium of market shares cannot be one that starts by accepting as legitimate ­ or as "normal conditions" ­ the effects of widespread and expensive subsidies that only a few Members can afford, to the expense of developing countries.
193. Brazil does not believe that subsidies representing 95 per cent of the value of a widely-traded commodity product like upland cotton can ever be considered to have been provided under "normal conditions". Nor can a dramatic increase in absolute levels of subsidies coupled with the increase in
252 See Brazil's 9 September Further Submission, para. 288. 253 The New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary, 1993 edition, p. 843.

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-230
the subsidization rate (and in absolute subsidy payments) during the period MY 1999-2002 over a previous representative period be considered to be "normal conditions". Further, when a more than doubling of world market share by a WTO Member coincides with record low world prices, record gaps between total costs and market revenue and record amounts of that Member's subsidies, the subsidies cannot be considered to have been provided in "normal conditions".
185. Please respond to the following questions concerning the relationship between Article XVI:3 of the GATT 1994, the disciplines on export subsidies and domestic support in the Agreement on Agriculture and the disciplines on prohibited export subsidies and actionable subsidies in Articles 3, 5(c) and 6.3(d) of the SCM Agreement. BRA, US
(a) Are agricultural domestic support programmes challengeable under Article XVI:3 of the GATT 1994? How, if at all, is the title of Section B of Article XVI ("Additional provisions on export subsidies" (emphasis added)) relevant? How, if at all, are Articles 13 and 21.1, or any other provisions of the Agreement on Agriculture, relevant?
Brazil's Answer:
194. With respect to the first question, the answer is that any domestic support programme that grants "directly or indirectly" "any form of subsidy which operates to increase the export of any primary product" is covered by the second sentence of Article XVI:3. All of the domestic support subsidies challenged by Brazil in this case operate to increase US exports. Professor Sumner found that each of the challenged US subsidies he examined had the effect of increasing US exports.254
195. Because Article XVI, including Article XVI:3, deals with serious prejudice to the interests of another Member, the direct context for interpreting its provisions is found in Article 5 of the SCM Agreement. Article 5 makes no distinction between subsidies contingent upon export and domestic support subsidies. It provides that "[n]o Member should cause, through the use of any subsidy referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 of Article 1, adverse effects to the interests of other Members". Articles 1 and 2 of the SCM Agreement in turn make no distinction between export and domestic support subsidies.
196. The United States argues that the only subsidies governed by Article XVI:3 are export subsidies.255 This argument misreads Article XVI:3. Although the first sentence of Article XVI:3 refers to "subsidies on the export of primary products," the second sentence provides:
"If, however, a contracting party grants directly or indirectly any form of subsidy which operates to increase the export of any primary product from its territory . . ."
The word "however" is important, as it signifies that the second sentence contradicts the first and does not follow from it. Similarly, the use of the phrase "on the export of primary products" in the first sentence of Article XVI:3 is quite different from the phrase "which operates to increase the export of" in the second sentence of Article XVI:3. The notion of "on the export" is analogous to the export contingency set out in Article 3.1(a) of the SCM Agreement. However, the phrase "which operates to increase the export of" does not contain an export contingency requirement. Rather, it focuses on effects ­ whether the subsidies have the effect of increasing exports. Thus, read in light of the SCM Agreement, the second sentence of Article XVI:3 encompasses a notion of export-related subsidies that is far broader than subsidies that are "contingent upon export performance;" it includes as "export subsidies" those that operate to increase exports.
254 Brazil's 9 September Further Submission, Annex I, Tables 5a-5g. 255 US 7 October Oral Statement, para. 61.

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-231
197. Indeed, the reading of the second sentence of Article XVI:3 as meaning "subsidies contingent upon the export of products" would render Article XVI:3 a nullity. This is because under the US interpretation, any form of subsidy covered by the second sentence of Article XVI:3 would already be deemed prohibited as an export subsidy under Article 3.1(a). Given Article 13 of the Agreement on Agriculture, GATT Article XVI:3 is clearly intended to continue to provide rights and obligations for Members. Further, Article XVI is not a prohibited subsidy provision ­ it is an actionable subsidy provision. The subsidies and the provisions of Article XVI that are not superceded by the provisions of the SCM Agreement or the Agreement on Agriculture256 must be read consistent with the actionable subsidy provisions of Article 5 of the SCM Agreement. Article 5 makes no distinction between subsidies that are contingent upon export and those that are not.
198. With respect to the Panel's second question, the title of Section B is not determinative. In light of the use of the phrase "any form of subsidy" in the second sentence of Article XVI:3, the title of Section B is properly read as encompassing any subsidies that have any effect on a Member's exports ­ whether they be "export subsidies" contingent upon export or whether they are "export subsidies" having the effect of increasing exports. Finally, Brazil notes that the US argument that places primary reliance on the title of Section B to interpret the second sentence of Article XVI: 3 is also questionable given the fact that Article XVI:5 is also covered by the title of Section B ­ and it deals with all types of subsidies covered by Article XVI.
199. With respect to the Panel's reference to Article 21 of the Agreement on Agriculture, Brazil does not believe that it is particularly relevant. As the Appellate Body noted in the EC ­ Bananas case, Article 21 of the Agreement on Agriculture provides that the provisions of GATT 1994 and the other multilateral trade agreements on trade in goods "shall apply subject to the provisions of this Agreement".257 The drafters of the WTO Agreement did not intend agricultural trade to be a GATTfree zone - quite the opposite. They simply provided transitional provisions in Article 13 of the Agreement on Agriculture to moderate the application of some GATT provisions, strictly on a temporary basis. 258
200. Article 13 of the Agreement on Agriculture is not that relevant in providing guidance regarding whether domestic support measures are included within the meaning of "any type of subsidy" under Article XVI:3, second sentence. Article 13(b)(ii) exempts non-green box domestic support only from actions based on paragraph 1 of GATT Article XVI, and does not directly exempt Article XVI:3. However, Article XVI:1 and 3 must be read together in order to assert a claim of serious prejudice.259
201. Article 13(c)(ii) of the Agreement on Agriculture provides that during the "implementation period", export subsidies that conform fully to Part V, as reflected in a Member's Schedule, are exempt from "actions" based on Article XVI. By implication, such export subsidies are subject to actions under Article XVI after the expiry of the peace clause and will be subject to such actions as of the time that the Panel issues its ruling. The same applies for green box domestic support under Article 13(a)(ii). Those subsidies are also exempt from actions under GATT Article XVI, including Article XVI:3. But these subsidies can be challenged under Article XVI:3 following the termination of the peace clause.
(b) Are the requirements of Article XVI:3 of the GATT 1994 reflected in, developed by or subsumed by the requirements in Article 6.3(d) of the SCM Agreement, or in any other
256 See US- FSC, WT/DS108/AB/R, para 117 quoted in Question 185(a). 257 Appellate Body Report, EC ­ Bananas, WT/DS27/AB/R, para. 155. 258 Appellate Body Report, EC ­ Bananas, WT/DS27/AB/R, para. 155. 259 Brazil's 7 October Oral Statement, para. 59 (arguing that Articles XVI:1 and 3 are directly linked).

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-232
provisions of the covered agreements? Of what relevance, if any, is the Appellate Body Report in US-FSC, para. 117260 here?
Brazil's Answer:
202. Brazil agrees that Article 6.3(d) reflects one of the situations that would also fall under GATT Article XVI:3. An increase in the world market share compared to the previous three-year average through the effects of subsidies would be consistent with a finding of an inequitable share of world trade under GATT Article XVI:3. However, an increase over the previous three-year average is not a necessary prerequisite for a finding of a violation of GATT Article XVI:3. For example, a Member's share of world export trade may be inequitable even if that share has not increased over the average of the past three years. Similarly, a Member's increase in exports may be inequitable even if an increase in exports has not followed a consistent trend, as required under Article 6.3(d).
203. GATT Article XVI:3 is concerned with whether a particular level of a Members' share of world export trade is equitable, whereas Article 6.3(d) of the SCM Agreement only addresses an increase in the share. Article 6.3(d) creates a presumption that an increase in a Member's world market share over its previous three-year average that follows a consistent trend over a period when subsidies have been granted nullifies and impairs other Member's rights. No such presumption exists for Article XVI:3 ­ the nullification and impairment must be demonstrated by showing that the share
260 WT/DS108/AB/R, para 117: "... the provisions of the SCM Agreement do not provide explicit assistance as to the relationship between the export subsidy provisions of the SCM Agreement and Article XVI:4 of the GATT 1994. In the absence of any such specific textual guidance, we must determine the relationship between Articles 1.1(a)(1) and 3.1(a) of the SCM Agreement and Article XVI:4 of the GATT 1994 on the basis of the texts of the relevant provisions as a whole. It is clear from even a cursory examination of Article XVI:4 of the GATT 1994 that it differs very substantially from the subsidy provisions of the SCM Agreement, and, in particular, from the export subsidy provisions of both the SCM Agreement and the Agreement on Agriculture. First of all, the SCM Agreement contains an express definition of the term "subsidy" which is not contained in Article XVI:4. In fact, as we have observed previously, the SCM Agreement contains a broad package of new export subsidy disciplines that "go well beyond merely applying and interpreting Articles VI, XVI and XXIII of the GATT 1947". Next, Article XVI:4 prohibits export subsidies only when they result in the export sale of a product at a price lower than the "comparable price charged for the like product to buyers in the domestic market." In contrast, the SCM Agreement establishes a much broader prohibition against any subsidy which is "contingent upon export performance". To say the least, the rule contained in Article 3.1(a) of the SCM Agreement that all subsidies which are "contingent upon export performance" are prohibited is significantly different from a rule that prohibits only those subsidies which result in a lower price for the exported product than the comparable price for that product when sold in the domestic market. Thus, whether or not a measure is an export subsidy under Article XVI:4 of the GATT 1947 provides no guidance in determining whether that measure is a prohibited export subsidy under Article 3.1(a) of the SCM Agreement. Also, and significantly, Article XVI:4 of the GATT 1994 does not apply to "primary products", which include agricultural products. Unquestionably, the explicit export subsidy disciplines, relating to agricultural products, contained in Articles 3, 8, 9 and 10 of the Agreement on Agriculture must clearly take precedence over the exemption of primary products from export subsidy disciplines in Article XVI:4 of the GATT 1994."

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-233
of world export trade is inequitable. While a particular situation may ­ as in this dispute ­ fall under both provisions, the focus and proof required for both provisions can be different.
204. Thus, Article 6.3(d) of the SCM Agreement subjects a specific subset of the situations covered by GATT Article XVI:3 to the remedy provided in Article 7.8 of the SCM Agreement. But it does not cover all of the situations covered by GATT Article XVI:3. This marks the crucial distinction between the provisions on export subsidies in the SCM Agreement that "take precedence" over those in GATT261 and the provisions on actionable subsidies in both agreements that are complementary.
205. With respect to the Appellate Body's holding in paragraph 117 of US ­ FSC, the provisions on export subsidies in Articles 3 and 4 of the SCM Agreement represent the results of years of negotiations that have pushed the level of obligation in this area well beyond Article XVI:4. The conclusion that the Appellate Body drew in that instance was that "whether or not a measure is an export subsidy under Article XVI:4 of the GATT 1947 provides no guidance in determining whether that measure is a prohibited export subsidy under Article 3.1(a) of the SCM Agreement." Brazil agrees that the provisions of Article XVI:2-4 that deal with subsidies contingent upon export performance are superceded by the respective export subsidy provision contained in the Agreement on Agriculture and in the SCM Agreement.
206. However, as Brazil has argued in response to Question 185(a), the second sentence of GATT Article XVI:3 is not a provision limited to subsidies contingent upon export performance. Rather, its disciplines apply to any form of subsidy that operates to increase the exports of a Member. Thus, it is not superceded by the export subsidy provisions of the Agreement on Agriculture and the SCM Agreement. Rather, it provides rights and obligations concerning any form of a subsidy independent of the right and obligations set forth in Article 3 of the SCM Agreement.262
(c) Of what relevance, if any, is the fact that the definition of "subsidy" in Article 1 of the SCM Agreement and the prohibition on subsidies contingent upon export in Article 3.1(a) were introduced in the Uruguay Round, but did not exist at the time that the GATT 1947 was negotiated?
Brazil's Answer:
207. The short answer is "not at all." What is important for the Panel to consider is the entire package of Uruguay Round agreements, including the GATT 1994 and the contemporaneous SCM Agreement, not what was in GATT 1947.
208. Every agreement attached to the WTO Agreement is contemporaneous with every other attached agreement. The GATT 1947 no longer binds WTO Members; what is binding is the GATT 1994. The SCM Agreement and the GATT 1994 must be read together, and each provides "context" for interpreting the other, in the sense of Article 31(2) of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties. As the Appellate Body noted in Argentina ­ Footwear263, and as is now well established, the WTO Agreement is a single undertaking. All WTO obligations are, therefore, generally cumulative, and Members must comply with all of them simultaneously: "It is important to understand that the WTO Agreement is one treaty."264 Thus, in as far as GATT Article XIX and the Agreement on Safeguards apply cumulatively, GATT Article XVI and the SCM Agreement apply cumulatively.

Brazil's Answer:
209. Brazil confirms that the correct figure in paragraph 37 of Brazil's 7 October Oral Statement is 38.3 per cent, i.e., that the US world market share in MY 2001 was 38.3 per cent.265
190. Please confirm that the figure "17.5" in paragraph 43 of Brazil's 7 October oral statement, is "percentage point". BRA Brazil's Answer:
210. Brazil confirms that the figure "17.5" in paragraph 43 of Brazil's 7 October Oral Statement refers to an increase by 17.5 percentage points in the world market share. Brazil further notes that ­ as explained in note 468 to Figure 26 of its 9 September Further Submission ­ the world market share refers to the world market share in the international cotton market, including the upland cotton and extra-long staple cotton market, as data on upland cotton only is not available to Brazil. However, given the small size of the extra-long staple market as compared to the upland cotton market, this only minimally distorts the data.266
191. Could Brazil clarify its statement in para. 12 of its 9 September further submission: "Alternatively crop insurance is not specific because the 2000 ARP Act denies benefits to commodities representing more than half of the value of US agriculture. Further US crops represent only 0.8 per cent of total US GDP." (emphasis added) BRA Brazil's Answer:
211. Brazil thanks the Panel for bringing to its attention the error in paragraph 12 of its 9 September Further Submission. As clarified in paragraphs 67-69 of the same submission, Brazil meant to state that "[a]lternatively, crop insurance is specific because the 2000 ARP Act denies benefits to commodities representing more that half of the value of US agriculture" (emphasis added).

FOLLOWING THE SECOND SESSION OF THE FIRST SUBSTANTIVE PANEL MEETING
27 October 2003
A. REQUEST FOR PRELIMINARY RULINGS
122. Does Brazil allege that cottonseed payments, interest subsidies and storage payments are included in the subsidies that cause serious prejudice? Do they appear in the economic calculations? BRA
123. Does Brazil's request for the establishment of the Panel name the statute authorizing cottonseed payments for the 1999 crop? BRA
B. EXEMPTION FROM ACTIONS
124. According to its revised timetable, the Panel will issue its report to the parties after the end of the 2003 calendar year. Does this have any impact on "exempt[ion] from actions" under Article 13(b)(ii) and 13(c)(ii) of the Agreement on Agriculture? BRA, US
1. The scheduled issuance of the Panel's report after the end of the 2003 calendar year has no impact on the applicability of Article 13(a)(ii), (b)(ii) and (c)(ii) of the Agreement on Agriculture to the US measures in this dispute. There is no question, and Brazil has not contested, that Article 13 was in effect at the time of the Panel's establishment, and the Panel's terms of reference set on that date are to examine the matter raised in Brazil's panel request in light of the covered agreements, which include the Agreement on Agriculture.
2. As a separate matter not presented by this dispute, the United States notes that the commitments of the United States with respect to cotton are specified by marketing year, not calendar year. Therefore, the end of the 2003 calendar year would in any case not be relevant to the question of when the provisions of Article 13 cease to have effect with respect to US support measures for upland cotton.1

(1) In view of requirements in the FAIR Act of 1996 and the FSRI Act of 2002 that contract acreage remain in agricultural or conservation uses and which impose penalties if the producer grows fruits or vegetables, how likely is it that the producer with upland cotton base acreage will not use his or her land to produce programme crops or covered commodities? US
1 See Agreement on Agriculture Article 1(i) ("`[Y]ear' in paragraph (f) above and in relation to the specific commitments of a Member refers to the calendar, financial or marketing year specified in the Schedule relating to that Member.")

3. With respect to contract acreage on a farm, the 2002 Act generally allows any commodity or crop to be planted on base acres on a farm for which direct payments are made, with limitations for certain commodities (fruits, vegetables (other than lentils, mung beans, and dry peas), and wild rice). With some exceptions, planting of those limited commodities on base acres is prohibited and could lead to reduced or eliminated direct payments.2 Otherwise, a producer (or landowner) is permitted to make any other use of the land so long as the land on the farm in a quantity equal to base acreage is used for an agricultural or conserving use.3 Thus, the direct payment recipient has the flexibility to plant and harvest any other commodity or crop on the land representing their upland cotton base acreage; indeed, direct payment recipients may plant nothing at all and still receive payment. (We note that the foregoing description of the "planting flexibility" under the 2002 Act is relevant only to base acres on a farm for which direct payments are made; other acres on the farm need not comply with any of the contract requirements set out in Sections 1105 and 1106 of the 2002 Act.)
4. The data demonstrate that planting and harvesting decisions by US producers result in US upland cotton area varying significantly. In marketing year 2003, for example, US farmers planted 13,748,000 acres, a decline of 11.3 per cent from the recent high reached in marketing year 2001.4 As indicated in the US closing statement at the second session of the first panel meeting, US harvested acreage largely increases and decreases in line with the rest of the world.5 In marketing year 2001, US area harvested increased by almost the exact same percentage as did the rest of the world. In marketing year 2002, the per cent decline in harvested acreage in the United States was greater than that observed in the rest of the world. Thus, regardless of whether US farmers who plant upland cotton may also be holders of upland cotton base acres, and contrary to Brazil's assertions, US farmers respond to market signals by planting or harvesting upland cotton much as producers in the rest of the world do.
(2) Brazil has submitted that "The record suggests that historic producers are current producers." It points to factors including the specialization of upland cotton producers, the need to recoup expensive investments in cotton-specific equipment, and the geographic focus and climatic requirements of upland cotton production in the "cotton belt". (Brazil's rebuttal submission, footnote 98, on page 24)
(a) Regarding the specialization of upland cotton producers and the geographic focus of upland cotton production, how does Brazil take account of the fact that cotton is produced in 17 of the 50 states of the United States and that average cotton area is approximately 38% of a cotton farm's acres? (This information is taken from the US's response to question 67bis, footnote 35). BRA
(b) Regarding the geographic focus of upland cotton production, how many other crops can upland cotton producers viably grow in the cotton belt, other than fruits and vegetables? US
5. Based on planted acreage data as reported by National Agricultural Statistics Service6, US upland cotton is produced in several diverse regions across the Cottonbelt, generally known as the Southeast, Delta, Southwest, and West regions. Across the regions (as well as within a given region), producers are faced with differing physical growing environments as well as economic factors that help determine the viability of upland cotton or some other alternative crop in any given year. Over

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-237
the last several years, producers have reduced plantings of upland cotton and increased plantings to alternatives. A list of the full range of alternative crops that are viable in these areas would be extensive. Below we present a regional breakdown of some principal alternative crops to upland cotton as well as historical plantings since 1996 of these crops compared with upland cotton.
6. Upland cotton producers in the Southeast region (Alabama, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Virginia) have corn and soybeans as principal alternative crops. Peanuts are also an alternative, though mainly in Georgia. Between 1996 and 2003, area planted to upland cotton, corn, and soybeans in the Southeast averaged about 8.6 million acres, ranging from 8.2 to 9.1 million acres. During this same period, upland cotton area ranged from 3.0 to 3.6 million acres. Since 2001, upland cotton has been reduced in favour of corn and soybeans in this region.
7. Upland producers in the Delta region (Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, and Tennessee) also have corn and soybeans as an alternative and, to a lesser extent, rice in some areas. Between 1996 and 2003, area planted to these 4 crops averaged 22.9 million acres, ranging from 22.2 to 23.8 million. At the same time, upland cotton area ranged from 3.2 to 4.6 million acres. Like the Southeast region, the Delta area planted to upland has declined since 2001 in favour of corn and soybeans.
8. The Southwest region (Texas, Oklahoma, and Kansas) has the most diverse growing environment of the 4 regions. In the northern part of the region ­ where most of upland cotton is grown ­ principal alternatives to upland cotton may include wheat and sorghum. In the southern part, however, corn, soybeans, and sorghum are generally an alternative to upland cotton. The Southwest region planted an average of 26.3 million acres to these 5 crops between 1996 and 2003.7 Area ranged from 24.5 to 27.9 million acres during this period. Meanwhile, upland cotton area ranged from 5.7 to 6.7 million acres. Since 2000, upland area in the Southwest has fallen in favour of sorghum, wheat, and corn.
9. In the West region (California, Arizona, and New Mexico), upland producers have a variety of alternatives, including corn, extra-long staple (ELS) cotton, alfalfa, and wheat. Between 1996 and 2003, area planted to these 5 crops averaged 4.3 million acres in the region, ranging from 4.0 to 4.6 million. At the same time, upland cotton area has ranged from 0.7 to 1.4 million acres. The last several years, however, have seen upland area decline in favour of one or more of the alternative crops.
(c) Regarding the high cost of upland cotton production, can Brazil show that farms who planted upland cotton could only have covered their costs by receiving upland cotton, rice or peanut payments in every year from 1999 through 2002? BRA
(d) Regarding the need to recoup investments in cotton-specific equipment, is it important to planting decisions that upland cotton producers cannot run any other crop through their cotton-pickers? How does this affect the likelihood that they will grow other crops? US
10. The National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) reported that in 2002, farmers paid an average of $225,000 for a cotton picker.8 Farmers may respond to machinery costs through the contracting-out of harvesting operations and rental or leasing of cotton-picking machinery.
7To be conservative, we have excluded Kansas wheat and sorghum acreage from the totals presented due to the state's large production of these crops and relatively small production of cotton.

11. In the short run, investment costs may slow acreage adjustments to market prices. This does not mean, however, that cotton producers do not respond to changes in market prices. Research by Lin et al. suggest that cotton producers may, in fact, be more responsive to own price changes (that is, the response of cotton acreage to changes in cotton prices as opposed to changes in prices of competing crops) than other competing crops are.9 In the long run, fixed assets like cotton pickers are less of a constraint to entry, and thus one would expect the acreage response to changes in price to be larger.

National acreage price elasticity

(3) In calculating the amount of PFC, MLA, direct and counter-cyclical payments that went on upland cotton, Brazil made an adjustment for the ratio of current acreage to base acreage (see its answer to question 67, footnotes 2, 3, 4 and 5). Is this an appropriate adjustment for the particular factors referred to above? Why or why not? BRA, US

12. Brazil's adjustment is not appropriate. It does not explicitly take into account any of the factors referred to above. Instead, Brazil's belated adjustment is simply based on the assumption that all of the planted cotton acreage was by producers who had cotton base acreage exactly equal to their planted acreage. This assumption is inaccurate and causes Brazil's figures to be in error. For some producers, cotton planted acres exceed their historical base, and some cotton acres are planted by producers who have no cotton base. As noted in the US further submission, important changes such as lowered costs from pest eradication and adoption of biotechnology have lowered costs and brought new areas and farmers into cotton production. Brazil's adjustment takes no account of these changes.

13. More fundamentally, the relevant point is that any producers who have upland cotton base will receive direct and counter-cyclical payments regardless of whether they plant upland cotton. Thus, the decision to plant upland cotton will be based on expected economic returns of cotton and competing crops ­ not the level of direct and counter-cyclical payments that are decoupled from the decision to produce upland cotton. And the fact that these are decoupled payments means that the amount of the payment could not in any event be allocated only to cotton production.

(4) Dr. Glauber has alleged that there are statistical problems in comparing planted acres to programme acres because of abandonment of crops and also because planted acres are only survey estimates, not reported figures (See Exhibit US-24, the first full paragraph in P2). Would it be more appropriate to divide harvested acreage by base acreage? What margin of error is there between the survey estimates and reported figures? BRA, US

14. Exhibit US-24 outlines the statistical problems associated with dividing complying base acres by planted acres. The discussion addressed complying base acres under the Acreage Reduction Programme of 1990 Farm Bill and did not address programme payment acres as defined under the

9 Lin, W., et al.. Supply Response Under the 1996 Farm Act and Implications for the US Field Crops Sector. US Department of Agriculture, Economic Research Service, Technical Bulletin No. 1888, Appendix table 21 (Exhibit US-64).

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-239
1996 Farm Bill. Dividing harvested acreage by base acreage could potentially overstate the difference if there is significant acreage abandonment after producers reported their payment acres to the Farm Service Agency. Also, there remains a problem with the comparison since harvested acres are surveybased while base acres are reported numbers.
15. In the June Acreage report, the National Agricultural Statistics Service reports reliability estimates for selected crops. The reliability of acreage estimates is computed by expressing the deviations between the planted acreage estimates and the final estimates as a per cent of the final estimates and averaging the squared percentage deviations for the 1983-2002 twenty-year period; the square root of this average becomes statistically the "Root Mean Square Error." Probability statements can be made concerning expected differences in the current estimates relative to the final estimates assuming that factors affecting this year's estimate are not different from those influencing the past 20 years. For example, the "Root Mean Square Error" for the upland cotton planted estimate is 2.4 per cent. This means that chances are 2 out of 3 that the current cotton acreage will not be above or below the final estimate by more than 2.4 per cent. NASS reports that the 90 per cent confidence interval for the upland cotton estimate is 4.1 per cent. This means that chances are 9 out of 10 (90 per cent confidence level) that the difference will not exceed 4.1 per cent.10
(5) Do the acreage reports under section 1105(c) of the FSRI Act of 2002 indicate or assist in determining the number or proportion of acres of upland cotton planted on upland cotton base acres? Was there an acreage reporting requirement for upland cotton during MY1996 through 2002? BRA, US
16. The acreage reports filed under Section 1105(c) of the 2002 Act by farms receiving direct and counter-cyclical payments indicate what crops are planted on a farm. A farm is an administrative construct that consists of tracts of land that are operated as one unit. The farm may be operated by more than one producer, and a producer may produce crops on more than one farm. The acreage report does not indicate the quantity of base acres on the farm. Because the acreage reports are filed after the planting season but before the harvest, the reports do not contain information on the quantity of production on each farm.
17. Based on a very preliminary review of a sampling of marketing year 2002 acreage reports, the United States estimates that roughly 53 per cent of farms that were eligible for direct and countercyclical payments for upland cotton base acreage also planted at least one acre of upland cotton in 2002. That is, approximately 47 per cent of farms receiving direct and counter-cyclical payments in 2002 for upland cotton base acreage planted no upland cotton at all.
18. Over the period 1996 through 2002, there was no statutory requirement for acreage reports by recipients of decoupled payments or marketing loan payments. By regulation, producers who signed up for disaster assistance or who received marketing loan benefits (including loan deficiency payments) were asked to file planting acreage reports. Reports for producers receiving disaster assistance were to cover all acreage on the farm while reports for producers receiving marketing loan benefits were to cover only acreage for the crop receiving benefits. As a result, acreage reports over the period of the 1996 Act are incomplete.
(6) Please prepare a chart showing upland cotton base acreage, planted acreage and harvested acreage for MY1996 through 2002. Does the planted acreage fluctuate within a broad band? If not, does this indicate any stability in decisions to plant the same acres to upland cotton? BRA, US

20. Over the period 1996-2002, US upland cotton planted acres ranged considerably, from 13,064,000 acres to 15,499,000 acres. Year-over-year, planted and harvested acreage can rise or fall significantly. For example, from marketing year 2001 to marketing year 2002, planted acreage fell by 1.785 million acres or 11.5 per cent; harvested acreage fell by 1.376 million acres or 10.1 per cent. As was pointed out in the US closing statement at the second session of the first substantive meeting of the Panel and in Exhibit US-63, year-over-year changes in US harvested cotton acreage have been similar to year-over-year changes for harvested cotton acreage outside of the United States. These data do not provide any information on whether the same or different acres are planted to upland cotton.

21. As noted above in the US answer to Question 125(5), based on a preliminary review of a sampling of marketing year 2002 acreage reports, it would appear that nearly half of farms receiving direct and counter-cyclical payments in 2002 for upland cotton base acreage planted no upland cotton at all. That so many farms that produced upland cotton during the historical base period of 1993-1995 or 1998-2001 no longer plant even a single acre of upland cotton suggests that there has been a large exit of past cotton producers and a large entry of new producers or a large expansion by other historical cotton producers.

(7) Brazil states that one third of all US farms with eligible acreage decided to update their base acreage under the direct payments and counter-cyclical payments programmes using their MY1998-2001 acreage. What is the proportion of the current base acreage for upland cotton resulting from such updating? Is the observed updating of base acreage consistent with Brazil's argument that it is only profitable to grow upland cotton on base acreage (and peanut and rice base acreage)? BRA

(8) How could one take account of upland cotton producers who receive PFC, MLA, direct and counter-cyclical payments for other covered commodity base acreage? BRA, US

22. Under Brazil's approach, one would need to take account of upland cotton producers receiving decoupled payments only for base acreage for other covered commodities. This follows from Brazil's explanation that "only the portion of upland cotton [decoupled] payments that actually benefits acres planted to upland cotton can be considered support to upland cotton".11 Thus, under Brazil's approach, one would need to deduct any production (or acreage) attributable to such producers from the acreage figures Brazil has used to adjust the amount of decoupled payments on upland cotton base acreage.

11 Brazil's Answer to Question 67 from the Panel, fn. 2-5.

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-241
(9) Assuming that Brazil's payment figures were to amount to a prima facie case, please answer the following questions: US
(a) How would the United States calculate or estimate the proportion of upland cotton producers who receive subsidy payments for upland cotton base acreage?
(b) Should any adjustment estimates be made for any factors besides those listed by Brazil?
(c) What adjustment estimate would it be appropriate to make?
(d) How could one take account of upland cotton producers who receive decoupled payments for other programme crop base acreage?
(e) Could the US specifically indicate what, in its view, are the flaws in the approach summarized in paras. 6-7 of Brazil's closing oral statement on 9 October (i.e. the use of the ration of 0.87 to adjust the amount of total upland cotton direct and CCPs for the MY to obtain the amount of subsidies received by upland cotton producers)? Can the US suggest an alternative approach that would yield reliable results in its view?
23. Putting Peace Clause and green box issues to one side, the United States believes that the issue of what payments may be attributed to upland cotton production is fundamentally part of Brazil's burden to present evidence substantiating the amount of the subsidy that it is challenging. However, the United States would note that this issue is not a matter of "the proportion of upland cotton producers who receive subsidy payments for upland cotton base acreage." Rather, the issue is, first, what is the quantity of decoupled payments received by upland cotton producers; second, how are those payments allocated across the total value of each farm's agricultural production; and third, how much and in what amount are US cotton exports subsidized by these payments.
24. Brazil has conceded that decoupled payments made with respect to upland cotton base acreage are not "tied to the production or sale" of upland cotton, by adjusting such payments by 0.87.12 That is, Brazil recognizes that, even on its theory, at least 0.13 of these payments "can[not] be considered support to upland cotton" because at least that fraction of upland cotton base acres were not planted to upland cotton in marketing year 2002. Because these payments are not "tied to the production or sale" of upland cotton, as suggested by Annex IV of the Subsidies Agreement, they must be allocated across the total value of production of each recipient. Brazil has not denied the applicability of the allocation methodology set out in Annex IV, but neither has Brazil provided any evidence relating to the total value of production of decoupled payment recipients.13
25. Brazil claims that its "suggested methodology is based on the conclusion that all upland cotton producers received these payments".14 In fact, Brazil's methodology is based on the further assumptions that (1) every acre of upland cotton in marketing year 2002 was planted by a holder of upland cotton base acreage and (2) no such base acreage holder planted more upland cotton than his or her base acres.15 Brazil has provided no evidence to support these assumptions, which is no
12 In addition to issues relating to the "adjustment," the United States disagrees with the total amount of decoupled payments paid with respect to upland cotton base acreage that Brazil calculates and uses as the base for its adjusted payment amounts. See US Answer to Additional Question 67bis from the Panel, para. 28, fn. 37, 38.
13 As noted in the Panel's Question 125(2)(a), average cotton area is approximately 38 per cent of a cotton farm's acres. Thus, a substantial portion of the average cotton farm's agricultural production will be derived from production of other crops.
14 Brazil's Closing Statement at the Second Session of the First Panel Meeting, para. 8. 15 Using figures for marketing year 2002 planted acreage and base acreage, Brazil claims, "Out of the 16.2 million upland cotton base acres, 2.1 million were not planted to upland cotton in MY2002." Brazil's Closing Statement at the Second Session of the First Panel Meeting, para. 6. However, given the planting and

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-242
surprise since the evidence is to the contrary. For example, the fluctuations in upland cotton planted and harvested area in recent years and the fact that one-third of all US farms with eligible acreage decided to update their base acreage using their MY1998-2001 acreage, imply substantial new entrants or new acreage that were not included in the base period figures under the 1996 Act. In fact, as noted above in the US answer to Question 125(5), based on a preliminary review of marketing year 2002 acreage reports, the United States estimates that nearly half of all farms receiving direct and counter-cyclical payments in 2002 for upland cotton base acreage planted no upland cotton at all.
26. We also note that there are substantial requirements with which a payment recipient must comply (see US answer to Question 162), such as highly erodable cropland conservation requirements and wetland conservation requirements.
D. "LIKE PRODUCT"
126. Does the US agree that the product at issue is upland cotton lint and that Brazilian upland cotton lint is "like" US upland cotton lint within the meaning of Article 6.3(c) of the SCM Agreement in that it is a separate like product that is identical or has characteristics similar to the upland cotton lint from the United States? (e.g. Brazil's further submission, para. 81) US
27. For purposes of this dispute, the United States is not arguing that all US cotton is "unlike" Brazilian cotton. There are some grades of cotton that both produce. Such grades would have similar characteristics although, as noted by Mr. Ward at the second session of the first panel meeting, Brazilian lint has been sold in the past at a substantial discount to the New York futures price. That discount has been declining over time as Brazil, a relatively new supplier internationally, works to establish a reputation for quality and reliability.
E. "SUBSIDIES"
127. The Panel notes that the US contests that export credit guarantees constitute "subsidies". The Panel recalls that the US agrees that Step 2 payments are "subsidies" and wishes to have confirmation that it is correct in understanding that the US does not disagree that the following are "subsidies" for the purposes of Article 1 of the SCM Agreement: marketing loan/loan deficiency payments, PFC, direct payments, market loss assistance and CCP payments, crop insurance payments, cottonseed payments, storage payments and interest subsidy (without prejudice to the Panel's rulings on the US requests for preliminary rulings on the latter two payments). US
28. With respect to marketing loan payments, the United States agrees that these product-specific amber box payments that are made to producers of upland cotton for the production of upland cotton are subsidies within the meaning of Article 1 of the Subsidies Agreement.
29. With respect to crop insurance payments, through which the United States pays a portion of the crop insurance premium for producers, the United States agrees that these amber box payments are subsidies within the meaning of Article 1 of the Subsidies Agreement. We note, however, that these payments are not product-specific because they are not made to upland cotton producers for the production of upland cotton. Rather, they are non-product-specific support made to "producers in general" (that is, generally). Further, these crop insurance payments are not specific within the meaning of Article 2 of the Subsidies Agreement because they are available with respect to all
base acreage numbers, the most Brazil can logically claim is that "at least 2.1 million [base acres] were not planted to upland cotton in MY2002". That is, if in 2002 new producers without base acres planted upland cotton or if some historical producers planted more than their base acres, then some portion of the 14.1 million planted acres in MY2002 were not planted "on" upland cotton base acres.

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-243
agricultural products for which policies are offered by private companies. Therefore, pursuant to Article 1.2, this "subsidy" is not subject to the provisions of Part III of the Subsidies Agreement.
30. With respect to cottonseed payments, we recall that these payments are not within the terms of reference of the Panel.16 With respect to "other payments" for upland cotton notified by the United States to the WTO ­ that is, storage payments and interest subsidy ­ the United States also recalls that these payments are not within the Panel's terms of reference.17 Without prejudice to the US request for preliminary rulings on these three types of payments, the United States considers that these product-specific amber box payments are subsidies within the meaning of Article 1.
31. With respect to green box production flexibility contract payments under the 1996 Act and direct payments under the 2002 Act, the United States does not consider that Brazil has demonstrated what is the amount of the subsidy attributable to upland cotton producers pursuant to Article 1. Article 1 requires that a financial contribution by a government or public body or income or price support confers a benefit. The subsidies Brazil challenges are subsidies to producers, users, and/or exporters of upland cotton. However, Brazil has not identified the portion of the production flexibility contract payments that is properly attributable to upland cotton producers as opposed to other recipients of this subsidy. In fact, Brazil concedes that the entire amount of these payments does not confer a benefit on upland cotton producers by reducing the amount of production flexibility contract payments and direct payments on upland cotton base acres by the proportion 14/16. However, Brazil has provided no evidence of the amount of these decoupled payments received by producers that currently produce cotton. Nor has Brazil demonstrated how much or to what extent US cotton exports are subsidized.
32. With respect to ad hoc market loss assistance and counter-cyclical payments under the 2002 Act, the United States also does not consider that Brazil has demonstrated what is the amount of the subsidy attributable to upland cotton producers pursuant to Article 1. Specifically, as with production flexibility contract payments and direct payments, Brazil has not identified the portion of the subsidy that is properly attributable to producers of upland cotton as opposed to other recipients of this subsidy. Brazil has not identified the benefit to upland cotton producers conferred by these payments. Rather, Brazil merely assumes that for every upland cotton harvested acre, upland cotton producers had a corresponding upland cotton base acre. However, Brazil has provided no evidence of the amount of these decoupled payments received by producers that currently produce cotton.
F. PROHIBITED SUBSIDIES
128. Could the US respond to Brazil's assertions relating to the meaning and effect of the introductory phrase of Article 3 ("Except as provided in the Agreement on Agriculture....")? Would the meaning/effect change if Article 13 of the Agreement on Agriculture did not exist? BRA, US
33. It is not entirely clear to the United States to which assertions of Brazil the Panel refers in its question. Moreover, the United States does not believe Brazil has purported to ascribe a specific meaning to that particular phrase. Indeed, with respect to Article 3.1(b), Brazil's arguments would effectively delete the introductory phrase in its entirety.18
G. SPECIFICITY / CROP INSURANCE
129. In the event that the Panel does not consider that the alleged prohibited subsidies fall within the provisions of Article 3 and are therefore, pursuant to Article 2.3, "deemed to be
16 See, e.g., US Further Submission, para. 8. 17 See US Further Submission, paras. 6-7. 18 See Answer of the United States to Panel Question 144, infra.

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-244
specific", are there any other grounds on which Brazil would rely in order to support the view that such measures are "specific" within the meaning of Article 2 of the SCM Agreement (see, for example, fn 16 of Brazil's further submission)? BRA
130. Does Brazil agree that the US insurance premium subsidy is available in respect of all agricultural products? Please cite relevant portions of the record. BRA
131. How should the concept of specificity - and, in particular, the concept of specificity to "an enterprise or industry or group of enterprises or industries" -- in Article 2 of the SCM Agreement apply to subsidies in respect of agricultural commodities? Please answer the following questions, citing the principles in Article 2 of the SCM Agreement: BRA, US
(a) is a subsidy in respect of all agricultural, but not other, products specific?
34. The United States does not regard a domestic subsidy as being specific solely because the subsidy is limited to the agricultural sector. As previously noted, this proposition is codified in the US countervailing duty regulations, at 19 C.F.R. § 351.502(d). Thus, the United States is of the view that the agricultural sector is too broad and too diverse to constitute a single "enterprise or industry or group of enterprises or industries".
(b) is a subsidy in respect of all agricultural crops (i.e. but not to other agricultural commodities, such as livestock) specific?
35. It is difficult to opine on this question in the abstract. However, this fact pattern does not apply to the US insurance premium subsidies, which are also available in respect of livestock.
(c) is a subsidy in respect of certain identified agricultural products specific?
36. It is difficult to opine on this question in the abstract. However, this fact pattern does not apply to the US insurance premium subsidies since the premium subsidy is a single subsidy programme available in respect of all products (while policies issued by private parties are in certain instances available in respect of certain identified products).
(d) is a subsidy in respect of upland cotton, but not other products, specific?
37. The United States assumes that this would require that the subsidy be limited to certain entities or the upland cotton industry and so would be specific. This fact pattern, however, does not apply to the US insurance premium subsidies since the premium subsidy is a single subsidy programme available with respect to all products (while policies issued by private parties are in certain instances available in respect of certain identified products).
(e) is a subsidy in respect of a certain proportion of the value of total US commodities (or total US agricultural commodities) specific?
38. In principle, a subsidy that is limited to a sufficiently small proportion of US commodities would be "limited", and, thus, "specific" within the meaning of Article 2.1(c). However, the Subsidies Agreement does not establish any quantitative standards for determining when a subsidy is so limited, and a proposal to establish such standards was rejected during the Uruguay Round. Therefore, the determination must be made on the basis of the facts of the particular case. This is the approach taken by the US Department of Commerce for purposes of the US countervailing duty law.

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-245
(f) is a subsidy in respect of a certain proportion of total US farmland specific?
39. This question is not presented in this dispute, but the United States would note that "land" is neither an "enterprise" nor an "industry", and so the proportion of farmland as such would not be appear to be relevant to the analysis under Article 2 of the Subsidies Agreement. The issue also does not appear to fall within the scope of Article 2.2, which deals with regional specificity ­ that is, "total US farmland" does not correspond to a "designated geographical region".
132. Please state the amount and percentage of upland cotton acreage covered by each crop insurance programme and/or policy under the ARP Act of 2000. US
40. There is one crop insurance programme, through which the United States provides premium subsidies on crop insurance policies that are offered by private insurance companies under the authority of the Federal Crop Insurance Act. There is no specific crop insurance programme or policies for cotton authorized under the Agricultural Risk Protection Act of 2000. Within this crop insurance programme, there are different plans of insurance that offer different types of coverage, such as production plans of insurance or revenue plans of insurance. All such plans of insurance are reinsured by FCIC and a premium subsidy paid by the US Government, is available. The amount and percentage of upland cotton acreage covered by each plan of insurance is shown in Exhibit US-65.
133. Concerning Brazil's arguments in its oral statement, para. 7, can the US indicate if any producers of livestock outside a pilot programme are covered by the crop insurance programme? US
41. Yes, producers of livestock outside of pilot programmes are covered by the crop insurance programme. In addition, there are policies being developed pursuant to pilot programmes in order to expand the scope of insurance products offered by private insurers to livestock producers. Thus, US crop insurance payments on premiums are made to a broad range of agricultural producers across the agricultural sector, including many livestock producers.
42. Livestock producers are eligible for several forms of "crop insurance" benefits under the provisions of the same operational statute that provides for benefits for "crops". Under the Federal Crop Insurance Act (7 USC 1501-1524), the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation (FCIC), an entity within the US Department of Agriculture, can approve insurance products if there is "sufficient actuarial data" to justify it to producers of "agricultural commodities".19 See 7 USC 1508(a). The Act defines "agricultural commodity" to include a lengthy list of commodities, including such non-plant commodities as "finfish" and "mollusks". The definition also includes any "other agricultural commodity", except stored grain (the crop that produced the grain would be eligible for coverage), as determined by the Board of Directors of FCIC.
43. Thus, FCIC has the authority to offer insurance for livestock under its regular insurance programmes. The FCIC has approved products providing income protection to producers with livestock on t heir farm as contemplated in the statute. In addition, with the enactment of the Agricultural Risk Protection Act of 2000 (ARPA) (Pub. Law 106-224), Congress specifically mandated that FCIC offer pilot programmes for livestock. See 7 USC 1523.
44. The Adjusted Gross Revenue (AGR) product provides protection against low revenue due to unavoidable natural disasters and market fluctuations that occur during the insurance year. Covered farm revenue consists of income from all agricultural commodities, including amounts of income from animals and animal products and aquaculture reared in a controlled environment. To be eligible to purchase an AGR policy, the producer can earn no more than 35 per cent of expected allowable income from animals and animal products. Because the amount of livestock is considered incidental,
19 See 7 US Code § 1508.

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-246
the expenditures are not counted against the funding limitations for livestock contained in 7 USC 1523 (which have never been reached).
45. The 35 per cent limit does not apply in the so-called "AGR-lite" programme, which was developed by, and originally available only in, Pennsylvania , the state that developed the policy. However, beginning with the 2004 crop year, an "AGR-lite" product will be expanded to counties in Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Vermont, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey and Rhode Island, and selected counties in West Virginia, New York, and Maryland, as approved by RMA. In all, the AGR-lite programme will now cover about 300 counties. That expansion of AGR-Lite was announced in an 18 August 2003, press release, available on the RMA website.
46. There are at least four kinds of products specifically for livestock available to livestock producers, and they are described at the website of the Risk Management Agency (RMA) (www.rma.usda.gov). There are two different policies that are available for swine producers. The first is Livestock Risk Protect (LRP- Swine). Originally that product was available only in Iowa. RMA recently announced that the policy may be offered to swine producers in 10 additional states: Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Minnesota, Nebraska, Nevada, Oklahoma, Texas, Utah and Wyoming. The other policy available to swine producers is Livestock Gross Margin (LGM), which is available in Iowa. For cattle, there are two specialized policies available. Livestock producers may purchase a LRP-Feeder Cattle policy in Colorado, Iowa, Kansas, Nebraska, Nevada, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, and Wyoming. Finally, there are "LRP-Fed Cattle" policies in Illinois, Iowa and Nebraska.
134. Please state the annual amount of premiums paid or contributions made by US upland cotton farmers relating to each of the crop insurance programmes and/or policies supported by the US Risk Management Agency and the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation in each year from 1992 through 2002. US
47. Please see Exhibit US-66.
135. Please state the annual amount of insurance indemnity payments made by the US government; or insurance companies participating in crop insurance programmes and/or policies under the ARP Act of 2000 to upland cotton farmers in each year from 1992 through 2002. US
48. Please see Exhibit US-67.
136. Is the US arguing that crop insurance subsidies corresponding to "over 90 per cent of insured cotton area" (US 7 October oral statement, para. 46) in MY1999 through 2002 are consistent with paragraph 8(a) of Annex 2 of the Agreement on Agriculture? Is it correct that in the past these subsidies were nonetheless notified to the Committee on Agriculture as non-product specific AMS (see, for example, G/AG/N/USA/43 in Exhibit BRA-47)? US
49. The United States has notified crop insurance payments to the Committee on Agriculture as non-product specific support. This is consistent with the US position that crop insurance subsidies are generally available subsidies to the agricultural sector as a whole.20 In the US oral statement of 7 October 2003, it is pointed out that over 90 per cent of the cotton area currently under the programme is insured at coverage levels of 70 per cent or less of expected yield (or revenue). Over all commodities, almost 70 per cent of total insured area is insured at 70 per cent or less of expected yield or revenue. Thus, associated subsidies would be consistent with paragraph 8(a) of Annex 2 of the Agreement on Agriculture ­ that is, payments for relief from natural disasters that Members have

agreed have no or at most minimal trade-distorting effects or effects on production. The point is made to stress that such subsidies that satisfy green box criteria are likely non-production distorting, contrary to the assertions made by Brazil.
H. EXPORT CREDIT GUARANTEES
137. Please elaborate the meaning of "net losses" as is used in paragraph 70 of Brazil's 7 October oral statement. BRA
138. Please comment on Brazil's views stated in paragraph 70 of its 7 October oral statement. US
50. In specific response to Brazil's views stated in that paragraph, the United States invites the attention of the Panel to paragraphs 157-162 of the 22 August US Rebuttal Submission, the table accompanying paragraph 161 of that submission, and paragraphs 144-150 of 30 September Further Submission of the United States. Paragraph 70 of Brazil's 7 October oral statement is simply a recapitulation of arguments it had previously advanced.
51. As noted in paragraph 144 of the US Further Submission, current data for each of the cohorts for 1992, 1993, 1994, 1995, 1996, and 1999 indicates a profit.21 As stated in OMB Circular No. A11: "The subsidy cost is the estimated present value of the cash flows . . . resulting from a direct loan or loan guarantee . . . . A positive net present value means that the Government is extending a subsidy to borrowers; a negative present value means that the credit programme generates a `profit' (excluding administrative costs) to the Government."22
139. In the context of export credit guarantees, is the Panel correct in understanding that Brazil's claims of inconsistency with the Agriculture Agreement involve GSM 102, GSM 103 and SCGP, but that it limits its "serious prejudice" allegations in respect of export credit guarantee programmes to the GSM 102 programme, and does not challenge GSM 103 and SCGP in this respect? If so,
(a) could Brazil please explain why it did so, and confirm that all the data relied upon in its further submissions (e.g. in Table 13) relate to the GSM 102 programme rather than to GSM 102, GSM 103 and SCGP (and, if the data needs to be adjusted to take account of a narrower "serious prejudice" focus, supply GSM-102-relevant data)? BRA
(b) for the purposes of Article 13(c)(ii) of the Agreement on Agriculture, is it necessary for the Panel to examine only GSM 102 or should the Panel's examination include also GSM 103 and SCGP? Why or why not? BRA
140. Could Brazil explain how, if at all, it has treated export credit guarantees for the purpose of Table 1 of its further submission? BRA
141. The Panel notes the US argument, inter alia in its further submission, that the export credit guarantee programmes are "self-sustaining". Recalling that item (j) of the Illustrative List of Export Subsidies in Annex I of the SCM Agreement refers to "premium rates", could the US expand upon how it takes into account the premium rates for the export credit guarantee programmes in its analysis. US

22 OMB Circular No. A-11, section 185.2, pp. 185-3 and 185-4 (italics added) (Exhibit Bra-116).

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-248
52. Item (j) of the Illustrative List of Export Subsidies in Annex I of the SCM Agreement is concerned with whether premium rates are inadequate to cover the long-term operating costs and losses of the programmes. A rate is applied against a transaction amount to generate revenue to cover any costs and losses. In the context of the export credit guarantee programmes, the premium rate is applied against the volume of a particular transaction to generate revenue. The mere rate as an abstract number cannot generate revenue. Consequently, premium rates as applied to the volume of transactions is necessarily the principal source of programme revenue. In addition, recoveries ­ whether direct or through rescheduling ­ are an additional source of revenue. Revenue from all these sources are applied against its operating costs (e.g., administrative expenses) and losses from its claims experience. Alternatively, such recoveries may be viewed not as revenue but as a reduction of loss arising from claims experience. For example, a full recovery of an amount already paid as a claim yields a net loss of zero. Arithmetically, this would yield the same result as treating the recovery as revenue, offsetting the equivalent amount of prior loss.
53. As the United States noted in footnote 81 of its 30 September Further Submission, Brazil has erroneously argued that item (j) compels consideration only of premiums on the revenue side of the ledger for purposes of covering long-term operating costs and losses. In Brazil's Comment on the US answer to Panel question 77 (para. 94), Brazil states that "item (j) limits the revenue to be used to offset operating costs and losses to `premium rates'". To the contrary, item (j) envisions an examination of whether premium rates are inadequate to cover long-term operating costs and losses. It does not say that all other revenue must be excluded from the calculation of whether a loss has occurred. Brazil would argue that if the United States paid a claim on day 1 and recouped in full on day 2 the amount it had paid, it could not include such recovery in a determination of whether the programme satisfied item (j). Such a draconian result is economically illogical and certainly not compelled by the text. As noted above, whether the recovery is viewed as revenue or as a subtraction from loss, the net result would be the same, but it must be included in any evaluation of whether premium rates cover long-term operating costs and losses.
54. As the United States further noted in its response to Panel question 77 (11 August Answers to Panel Questions, para. 145), item (j) applies to three different types of programmes: export credits, export credit guarantees, and insurance. In the case of export credit guarantees and insurance, the provider will occasionally incur claims. To the extent such claims or defaults exceed revenue from whatever source it may be derived, the net result would be a loss arising from operations. In an accounting sense such result would constitute an `operating loss.'.
55. Revenues derived from fees paid in connection with the export credit guarantee programmes form an integral part of the estimate and re-estimate process that currently indicate profitability for each of the cohorts in 1992, 1993, 1994, 1995, 1996, and 1999.23 The application of the rates in this regard to the analysis is properly extended to 1992, as this is the first fiscal year of applicability of government-wide accounting for federal credit programmes under the Credit Reform Act of 1990. This period also conforms with the period that Brazil recognizes as appropriate for analysis under item (j).24 As a result of such profitability, the programmes are self-sustaining.
142. The US has pointed out that there are many limitations on granting export credit guarantees and that there is no requirement to issue any particular guarantee (US further
23 See Answer of the United States to Panel Question 138, supra. See also US Rebuttal Submission, para. 161 (chart of subsidy estimates and reestimates by cohort); US Further Submission, fns. 82 and 96.
24 See First Submission of Brazil (24 June 2003), para. 282: "[A] ten-year period . . . fulfils the criterion of being `long-term' within the meaning of item (j)." In contrast, no such long-term analysis is possible with respect to the Supplier Credit Guarantee Programme, the regulations for which were first promulgated only on 1 July 1996, with transactions commencing during fiscal year 1997.

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-249
submission, paras 153-156). Can the Commodity Credit Corporation decline to grant an export credit guarantee even in cases where the programme conditions are met? US
56. A proper response to this question requires one to define by what is meant by "programme conditions". The arguments of Brazil would appear to create a tautological circularity: if one assumes that none of the various discretionary programmatic and budgetary bases that would permit the Commodity Credit Corporation not to issue a particular export credit guarantee are in effect, then can the CCC decline to grant that particular guarantee? Under those circumstances the question itself dictates that the answer must be "no". The United States submits, however, that assuming away all of the real-world bases that would permit CCC to decline issuance of a guarantee is not a proper basis for analysis.
57. The fact remains, as the United States has pointed out, that numerous bases exist for denial of a guarantee.25 Brazil has argued, however, that "CCC does not enjoy the discretion to refuse to issue a guarantee to an eligible individual".26 This is simply not true. Perhaps a practical example would further illustrate the point. As the United States mentioned during the first substantive meeting of the Panel, CCC internally maintains limits on the amount of its exposure to obligations of particular foreign banks.27 Although a qualified applicant might apply for an export credit guarantee for an eligible good to an eligible destination (each of those elements themselves constituting potential bases for denying an application), notwithstanding the eligibility of the applicant, good, and destination, if the foreign-bank obligor envisioned in the transaction would exceed the applicable internally established exposure limit if it consummated the transaction, CCC could and would deny the application for the guarantee. Thus, while it is true that the CCC does not engage in any arbitrary or standard-less denials, the point is that no exporter seeking to engage in a particular export transaction can be certain of obtaining a credit because of CCC decisions relating to the conditions for issuance of export credit guarantees.
143. Brazil agrees with National Cotton Council estimates of the effects of the GSM 102 programmes (Brazil's further submission, para. 190) but it also cites a different conclusion by Prof. Sumner (paragraph 192). Brazil cites other estimates by Prof. Sumner throughout its further submission. Does Brazil adopt Prof. Sumner's conclusions and estimates as part of its submission? BRA
I. STEP 2 PAYMENTS
144. Is the Panel correct in understanding that the US does not dispute that Step 2 (domestic) payments are contingent upon import substitution, and that it argues that such measures are permitted due to the operation of the provisions of the Agreement on Agriculture? How is that relevant to a claim under Articles 5 and 6 of the SCM Agreement? US
58. The United States acknowledges that to receive a payment under the Step 2 programme a domestic user must open a bale of domestically produced baled upland cotton. As the United States noted in its Further Submission of 30 September 200328, the introductory clause of Article 3.1 of the Subsidies Agreement, "Except as provided in the Agreement on Agriculture", applies to both Articles 3.1(a) and 3.1(b). Brazil's arguments would delete the application of the introductory clause to Article 3.1(b). As the exception's applicability to Article 3.1(b) must be given meaning, the United States has noted that the Agreement on Agriculture does permit domestic content subsidies in favour
25 See, e.g., US Further Submission (30 September), paras. 153-156 26 Second Oral Statement of Brazil (7 October), para. 67. 27 See http://www.fsa.usda.gov/ccc/banks_foreign_rqts.htm. 28 Paras. 165-176.

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-250
of agricultural producers, albeit paid to processors, if such subsidies are provided consistently with the Member's domestic support reduction commitments.29 The European Communities concur.30
59. As the United States has previously indicated to the Panel31, the United States reports all Step 2 payments as product-specific domestic support to cotton. As the United States is entitled to the protection of the Peace Clause under Article 13(b)(ii) of the Agreement on Agriculture, the United States is exempt from action under Articles 5 and 6 of the Subsidies Agreement. By their express terms, Articles 5 and 6 do "not apply to subsidies maintained on agricultural products as provided in Article 13 of the Agreement on Agriculture".
60. The question of "import substitution" is otherwise irrelevant to Brazil's claims under Articles 5(c) and 6, which focus on the effect of the particular subsidy without regard to the origin requirements of the subsidy. In contrast, Article 3.1(b) focuses on whether a subsidy is contingent upon use of domestic over imported goods to determine whether a particular subsidy is a prohibited subsidy irrespective of its effect.
J. ACTIONABLE SUBSIDIES
145. The Panel notes that different remedies are available in respect of prohibited and actionable subsidies under Articles 4.7 and 7.8 of the SCM Agreement. If the Panel were to conclude that a subsidy was prohibited and were to make a recommendation under Article 4.7 of the SCM Agreement to withdraw the subsidy without delay, can the Panel:
(a) also conclude that the same subsidy had resulted in adverse effects to the interests of another Member? If so, what would be the value of such a conclusion in terms of the settlement of the matter before the Panel? BRA, US
(b) take into account the effects of the interaction of those prohibited subsidies with other, allegedly, actionable subsidies? If so, how is this relevant to the issue of causation under Article 5 of the SCM Agreement? BRA, US
61. As a practical matter, there may be limited value in a particular dispute from making a finding that a particular subsidy is both a prohibited subsidy and causes adverse effects. If a subsidy is prohibited, then the remedy required to be recommended under Article 4.7 is to withdraw the subsidy without delay. A finding at the same time that a subsidy causes serious prejudice, if done cumulatively with an analysis of other subsidies, would mean that it would leave unclear the question of whether the other, non-prohibited subsidies cause adverse effects. That may diminish the value (in terms of resolving the dispute) of any finding concerning those other subsidies.
62. On the other hand, if the Panel were to make a separate "adverse effects" analysis for each of the non-prohibited subsidies, there would be no reason to so analyze any prohibited subsidy. First, an adverse effects analysis of a prohibited subsidy could not affect a panel's findings with respect to each non-prohibited subsidy. Second, since under Article 4 the panel would have recommended withdrawal of the prohibited subsidy, compliance with Article 4 would also comply with a recommendation under Article 7. Therefore, having made a recommendation under Article 4 with respect to a subsidy, there would be no utility to also making a recommendation under Article 7.

146. Brazil acknowledges that there are some interaction effects that may increase or decrease the overall effects of the subsidies (Brazil's further submission, para. 225). How would your analysis under Articles 5(c) and 6.3 of the SCM Agreement and Article XVI of GATT 1994 differ if it excluded, for example, crop insurance subsidies, PFC and/or direct payments? BRA
147. Does the US agree that subsidies provided under the marketing loan programme, counter-cyclical payments and market loss assistance are or were more than minimally trade-distorting? If so, please elaborate on the type of effects which are more than minimally trade-distorting within the meaning of Annex 2 of the Agreement on Agriculture but less than adverse effects within the meaning of Article 5 of the SCM Agreement. US
63. The issues of whether a measure is more than minimally trade-distorting and whether a measure has adverse effects require two different analyses. While it may be a necessary condition that a subsidy has trade- or production-distorting effects in order to find that it causes adverse effects, it is not a sufficient condition. The question under an adverse effects analysis is one of the effect on a particular Member's "interests" ­ for example, whether injury to the domestic industry of another Member, nullification or impairment, or serious prejudice to the interests of another Member. Therefore, the mere showing that a subsidy can distort trade or production does not necessarily mean it has, for example, seriously prejudiced a particular Member's interests.
64. Marketing loan payments, counter-cyclical payments, and market loss assistance payments provide different types of support that can be expected to have different effects. As noted in the US answer to Question 127, the United States notifies marketing loan payments as product-specific amber box support. These payments are linked to production of upland cotton in favour of the producers of upland cotton ­ a producer must have harvested cotton to receive the payment. Therefore, the United States considers that marketing loan payments could not satisfy the general and policy-specific criteria set out in Annex 2 of the Agreement on Agriculture and therefore could not be deemed to have met the fundamental requirement of that Annex.
65. That a particular support measure does not conform to the general and policy-specific criteria of Annex 2 is relevant to the type of support it is deemed to be, which has meaning for a Member's compliance with its reduction commitments. That a particular measure is not green box, however, would not suffice to demonstrate that a measure has "adverse effects" within the meaning of Articles 5 and 6 of the Subsidies Agreement. A finding that a subsidy has caused adverse effects is a factintensive analysis. In the case of a claim of serious prejudice, for example, one of the four effects set out in Article 6.3 must be demonstrated (such as significant price suppression or depression by the subsidized product in the same market as the non-subsidized product is found) and the effects caused by the subsidy must rise to the level of "serious prejudice." Such a fact-intensive analysis must take into account, inter alia, the nature and amount of the subsidy, market conditions, and other factors affecting production, consumption, and prices.
66. Therefore, a conclusion that a measure does not provide green box support and therefore would not be deemed to have no or at most minimal trade-distorting effects or effects on production cannot take the place of the fact-intensive examination required to show causation under the WTO Agreements. For example, marketing loan payments provide a revenue floor of 52 cents per pound for US upland cotton producers. The effect of this subsidy would depend in large part on the producer's expected market revenue at the time of planting ­ that is, whether this expected revenue was above or below 52 cents per pound. Thus, the effect of this subsidy would be quite different from a subsidy that merely provided an unchanging per unit payment (e.g., 10 cents per pound), even if as a result of prices that actually develop over the course of a marketing year the per-unit payments under these two measures turn out to be the same. As another example, a measure that provided, in the aggregate, $1 of support linked to production of upland cotton could not satisfy the general and

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-252
policy-specific criteria of Annex 2 of the Agreement on Agriculture32, but it would be difficult to conceive that the effect of $1 in subsidies could be "significant price suppression [or] price depression" or "an increase in the world market share of the subsidizing Member" given the large number of market participants (including cotton producers worldwide), highly developed cotton markets, and volume and value of cotton trade.
67. With respect to counter-cyclical payments under the 2002 Act, the United States recalls that according to Brazil's interpretation of the first sentence of Annex 2 as a stand-alone requirement, if a measure has no more than minimal trade-distorting effects or effects on production, it follows that such a measure must be deemed green box. As the United States has demonstrated, the economic literature on decoupled payments (counter-cyclical payments are decoupled from production although linked to current prices) suggests that the effects on production of such income transfers are no more than minimal.33 Therefore, although the United States would not contend that counter-cyclical payments conform fully to the policy-specific criteria in Annex 2, there is not only no evidence that such payments have more than minimal trade-distorting effects or effect on production, but the evidence suggests the contrary. In such a case, the effect of a payment that does not have more than minimal effects on production would not appear to be "significant price suppression [or] depression" or an "increase in the world market share of the subsidizing Member", much less "serious prejudice".
68. The expired market loss assistance payments were ad hoc payments made during the 1999, 2000, and 2001 marketing years to holders of base acreage. These payments were not linked to production ­ that is, a recipient need not have produced upland cotton or any crop at all in order to receive the payment.34 However, because these payments were explicitly made in reaction to low commodity prices, the United States considered that these payments would not conform fully to the criteria in Annex 2 of the Agreement on Agriculture and therefore notified these payments as nonproduct-specific amber box support. As noted above with respect to the 2002 counter-cyclical payments, however, the economic literature on payments decoupled from production suggests that the effects on production of income transfers such as the market loss assistance payments are no more than minimal.35 Therefore, the evidence suggests that the effect of such payments could not be "significant price suppression [or] depression" or an "increase in the world market share of the subsidizing Member" resulting in "serious prejudice".
148. How should the significance of price suppression or depression be assessed under Article 6.3(c) of the SCM Agreement? In terms of a meaningful effect? Or another concept? BRA, US
69. As the United States has previously noted36, in Article 6.3(c) the term "significant" modifies the phrase "price suppression or depression", suggesting that it is the level of price suppression or depression itself that must be "important, notable" or "consequential".37 As Brazil agrees38, important
32 For example, the measure would not qualify as decoupled income support because, by requiring that recipients have produced upland cotton, the amount of the payment would be "related to, or based on, the type or volume of production . . . undertaken by the producer in any year after the base period". See Agreement on Agriculture, Annex 2, para. 6(b).
33 See, e.g., US Rebuttal Submission, paras. 59-64. 34 Supplemental legislation authorizing each of these payments was passed several months after planting for the crop year in question had occurred. Even if producers had some expectations of payment at planting time, they were eligible to receive such a payment regardless of what crop they planted. Indeed, they could choose not to plant and still be eligible for the payment. This would argue that market loss assistance payments, like production flexibility contract payments, direct payments, and counter-cyclical payments, are decoupled from planting decisions. 35 See, e.g., US Rebuttal Submission, paras. 59-64. 36 US Opening Statement at the Second para. 58. 37 US Further Submission, para. 83. 38 See Brazil's Further Submission, para. 88 ("This interpretation of price suppression and price depression is consistent with the relevant context of Article 6.3(c), which includes Article 15.2 of the SCM

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-253
context for interpreting this phrase can be found in Article 15.2 of the Subsidies Agreement, which sets out for countervailing duty purposes the same effects found in Article 6.3.39 This text confirms that the relevant analysis is whether the level of price suppression or depression itself is "significant":
With regard to the effect of subsidized imports on prices, the investigating authorities shall consider whether there has been a significant price undercutting by the subsidized imports as compared with the price of a like product of the importing Member, or whether the effect of such imports is otherwise to depress prices to a significant degree or to prevent price increases, which otherwise would have occurred, to a significant degree.40
Thus, Article 15.2 provides contextual support for reading the term "significant price suppression [or] depression" in Article 6.3(c) according to the ordinary meaning of its terms ­ that is, it is the degree of price suppression or depression itself that must be "significant".
70. As suggested by this analysis, it is not the effect on the producers of the complaining Member that must be "significant". In determining whether the alleged price suppression or depression is "important" or "notable", it will of course be relevant to look at that suppression or depression in the context of the prices that have been affected ­ that is, at the degree of suppression or depression. One absolute level of suppression or depression could be significant in the context of prices for one product but not for another and meaning must be given to the phrase "in the same market".
149. What is the meaning of "may" in the chapeau of Article 6.3(c) in the context of Brazil's assertion that there is no need to conduct a distinct analysis of "serious prejudice" under Article 5(c) after having made a finding under 6.3(c) or (d)? (Brazil's further submission, paras 437 ff). How, if at all, are Articles 6.2 and 6.8 relevant in this context? What context should the Panel use for assessing serious prejudice under Article 5(c) of the SCM Agreement if the Panel takes the view that Article 6.3(c) and (d) are permissive conditions for a determination of serious prejudice? US
71. The chapeau of Article 6.3 states that "[s]erious prejudice in the sense of paragraph (c) of Article 5 may arise in any case where one or more of the following apply". The Article then goes on to detail four effects that "may" result in serious prejudice arising. Brazil's reading would re-write the chapeau of Article 6.3, changing the permissive "may" into the obligatory "shall". The ordinary meaning of "may" is "to express possibility, opportunity, or permission".41 Therefore, the ordinary meaning of the chapeau of Article 6.3 would be that there is a "possibility" or "opportunity" for serious prejudice in the sense of Article 5(c) to arise where one or more of the effects listed in Article 6.3 is found.
72. Article 6.2 clarifies that a prerequisite for a finding of serious prejudice is that at least one of the four effects in Article 6.3 must be demonstrated. That is, Article 6.2 precludes a panel from finding serious prejudice ("serious prejudice shall not be found") if a subsidizing Member demonstrates that the subsidy has not had any of the effects listed in Article 6.3. This provided a subsidizing Member with a means to overcome the presumption created through the operation of
Agreement. That provision discusses standards for the determination of injury in countervailing duty cases and provides that the investigating authorities should consider whether the effect of imports is `to depress prices' or `to prevent price increases, which otherwise would have occurred . . .'[.]") (emphasis added).
39 Effects on prices form one part of a determination of injury for countervailing duty purposes. Pursuant to Article 15.1, such a determination of injury involves an objective examination of (a) the volume of subsidized imports and the effect of the subsidized imports on prices in the domestic market for like products and (b) the consequent impact of these imports on the domestic producers of such products.

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-254
Article 6.1 while that provision was still in effect. However, Article 6.1 demonstrates that Members knew how to create a presumption of serious prejudice: they did so by explicitly stating that, in certain cases, "[s]erious prejudice . . . shall be deemed to exist" (italics added). Article 6.2, while providing a means to rebut that presumption, does not by its terms establish that serious prejudice "shall be deemed to exist" if one of the effects in Article 6.3 exists.
73. Article 6.4 lends further contextual support to the interpretation that the use of the term "may" in the chapeau of Article 6.3 signifies that the effects listed in Article 6.3 are permissive conditions for a determination of serious prejudice. Article 6.4 states that "displacement or impeding of exports shall include any case in which, subject to the provisions of paragraph 7, it has been demonstrated that there has been a change in the relative shares of the market to the disadvantage of the non-subsidized like product". Thus, given certain situations further explained in Article 6.4, displacement or impeding of exports "shall" exist. However, Article 6.3 does not state that, given those situations, displacement or impeding of exports resulting in serious prejudice shall exist. That is, the situations in Article 6.4 which must result in a finding of displacement or impeding of export do not, by the terms of the Article, also result in a finding of serious prejudice.
74. Article 6.5 similarly defines a situation in which "price undercutting" under Article 6.3(c) "shall" be found but does not also mandate a finding of serious prejudice. Had Members intended (as Brazil contends) that a finding under Article 6.3 would necessarily suffice to demonstrate serious prejudice, one also would have expected Articles 6.4 and 6.5 to mandate a finding of serious prejudice where a finding of one of the effects under Article 6.3 is mandated.
75. Article 6.8 provides further contextual support for reading Article 6.3 as setting out certain permissive conditions that could result in a panel finding that serious prejudice to the interests of a Member exist. Article 6.8 states that, "in the absence of circumstances referred to in paragraph 7", which merely preclude a panel from finding displacement or impediment resulting in serious prejudice, "the existence of serious prejudice should be determined on the basis of the information submitted to or obtained by the panel" (italics added). Again, this provision does not mandate a finding of serious prejudice should one or more of the effects set out in Article 6.3 be demonstrated. Rather, it emphasizes that "the existence of serious prejudice" (rather than the existence of one of the effects in Article 6.3) "should be determined" by the panel based on the information before it. Thus, while a panel may be precluded from making a finding of serious prejudice (where, for example, a complaining party has only alleged displacement or impediment under Article 6.3, but one of the conditions in Article 6.7 exist), there is no currently effective provision under which a panel is compelled to find serious prejudice.
150. Is the list in Article 6.3 of the SCM Agreement exhaustive, or could serious prejudice arise in circumstances other than those listed in paragraphs (a) through (d)? US
76. Article 6.3 sets out four circumstances in which the effects of subsidies "may" give rise to a finding of serious prejudice. Article 6.2 establishes that "serious prejudice shall not be found" if a subsidizing Member demonstrates that a challenged subsidy has not resulted in any of those four effects. Therefore, Articles 6.3 and 6.2 indicate that serious prejudice may not be deemed to have arisen without at least one of the four effects listed in Article 6.3 having been demonstrated.
151. Where in the text of Article 6.3(d) of the SCM Agreement is there a basis to take into account that 1998 may be a "misleading" year for the purposes of comparison? For example, unlike the text of Article XVI:3 of the GATT 1994, there does not seem to be a general reference to "special factors". US
77. Article 6.3(d) requires that a complaining party demonstrate that the effect of a challenged subsidy is an increase in the world market share in a particular subsidized primary product or commodity as compared to the average share it had during the previous period of three years and this

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-255
increase follows a consistent trend over a period when subsidies have been granted. Where the evidence offered by a complaining party relies in large part on abnormal production and trade data evidently caused by factors unrelated to the challenged subsidy (in the case of the United States in 1998, severe drought and record abandonment of planted acres), use of that data cannot satisfy the complaining party's burden of demonstrating causation ­ that is, the "effect of the subsidy".
78. Article 6.3(d) sets out a fairly mechanical two-part test: first, there must be an increase in world market share as compared to the average over the preceding period of three years. Thus, assuming arguendo that Brazil could challenge expired marketing year 2001 support measures, this test would compare the world market share of US upland cotton in that year to the average over the preceding three years. Brazil, however, has misinterpreted Article 6.3(d) and examined the US world export share.
79. The second part of the test is that any such increase over the average of the preceding threeyear period "follows a consistent trend over a period when subsidies have been granted". The marketing year 2001 payments challenged by Brazil were first introduced for the 1996 marketing year by the 1996 Act. Thus, Brazil must demonstrate that the alleged increase in world market share follows a "consistent trend" between marketing years 1996-2001. In fact, there is no consistent trend showing an increasing US world market share over this period; that world market share has been inconsistent but showing a tendency to decline over that period. As demonstrated in Exhibit US-47, US world market share surpassed 20 per cent in both marketing years 1996 and 1997 but has not thereafter.
80. Finally, as the United States has noted in its further submission, Brazil has limited its claim under Article 6.3(d) to alleged effects in marketing year 2001.42 Thus, there can be no finding that challenged US subsidies under the 2002 Act presently cause serious prejudice within the meaning of Article 6.3(d). As the United States has previously noted, moreover, payments with respect to marketing year 2001 expired with the granting of support in respect of the 2002 marketing year's production, which began on 1 August 2002 ­ that is, seven months before this Panel's terms of reference were established. The result is that Brazil is asking the Panel to make findings and a recommendation with respect to subsidies that had been replaced at the time of panel establishment and that no longer exist to be withdrawn even were a recommendation to be made.
152. If the US is correct in asserting that the Article 13(b)(ii) Agreement on Agriculture analysis is a year-by-year analysis, how would this affect the Panel's examination of Brazil's claims of serious prejudice, including the three year period and the trend period in Article 6.3(d) of the SCM Agreement? US
81. Article 13(b)(ii) exempts from action measures that, inter alia, conform fully to the provisions of Article 6 of the Agreement on Agriculture. Chief among those provisions is the obligation that a Member remain within its Annual and Final Bound Commitment Levels for its Aggregate Measurement of Support, a commitment that is expressed by year. Therefore, while a Member may breach the Peace Clause in a given year by exceeding its bound commitment level, that Member may in the following year not breach the Peace Clause if its domestic support measures once again do not exceed its commitment levels. Thus, to gauge whether domestic support measures have breached the Peace Clause requires a year-by-year analysis.43
42 US Further Submission, para. 100. 43 Brazil agrees that the Peace Clause requires a year-by-year comparison. Brazil insists, however, that once a Member has breached the Peace Clause once, that Member can never thereafter regain Peace Clause protection. There is nothing in the text of the Peace Clause that supports Brazil's view on this point ­ nor, as a result, has Brazil pointed to any supporting text.

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-256
82. The year-by-year analysis under the Peace Clause does not affect how the Panel would undertake a serious prejudice analysis; it affects only the Panel's analysis of which of the US measures that Brazil has challenged may be the subject of the serious prejudice analysis. In the event, Brazil has only claimed that the effect of US subsidies in marketing year 2001 was inconsistent with Article 6.3(d). Therefore, the Panel's task is first to analyze whether US domestic support measures in marketing year 2001 breached the Peace Clause. If so, then the Panel would be able to undertake a serious prejudice analysis ­ and that second analysis is distinct from the first one. The United States has demonstrated that US measures in marketing year 2001 do not grant product-specific support to upland cotton in excess of that decided during the 1992 marketing year, whether measured according to the level of support granted by those measures or a price-gap AMS calculation.
83. With respect to the two-part test of the three-year average and consistent trend over a period when subsidies have been granted, the Peace Clause would have no impact on these tests. That is, assuming arguendo that marketing year 2001 measures were not exempt from action, the fact that the Peace Clause exempts from action measures for other marketing years would not preclude the Panel from examining data and evidence from those years as part of its serious prejudice analysis of the 2001 measures. The payments made in those other marketing years (that is, the marketing year 1999 measures and the marketing year 2000 measures) would be exempt from action; evidence relating to those years would not be sheltered from examination by the Panel in its serious prejudice analysis of the 2001 measures.
153. Would the conditions in Article 6.3(d) of the SCM Agreement be satisfied in respect of time periods other than the one specified? What relevance, if any, would this have for Brazil's claims? BRA
154. Does the US agree that upland cotton is a "primary product or commodity" within the meaning of Article 6.3(d) of the SCM Agreement? (ref. Brazil's further submission, para. 262) and within the meaning of Article XVI:3 of the GATT 1994? US
84. Yes.
155. Please respond to Brazil's identification of the seven-year period beginning with MY1996 (following the passage of the FAIR Act of 1996) as the "most representative period" for the purposes of Article 6.3(d)? (ref. Brazil further submission, para. 269) US
85. Brazil has challenged only those US subsidies that allegedly had the effect of increasing US world market share in marketing year 2001 ­ that is, marketing year 2001 payments. The second part of the test under Article 6.3(d) is that any increase in world market share that is the effect of the challenged subsidy over the average of the preceding three-year period "follows a consistent trend over a period when subsidies have been granted". The marketing year 2001 payments were granted under the 1996 Act. Therefore, the "period when subsidies have been granted" for purposes of an analysis of the effect of marketing year 2001 support would be the marketing year 1996-2001 period.
86. The United States believes that marketing year 2001 support cannot cause present serious prejudice because these payments expired when marketing year 2002 payments began to be made. Nonetheless, if marketing year 2001 payments are the challenged measures for purposes of Brazil's Article 6.3(d) claim, there is no basis to include marketing year 2002 within the period when subsidies have been granted. (We also note that Brazil identifies a seven-year period beginning with marketing year 1996 but presents data only for the six-year period through marketing year 2001.)

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-257
156. Does the US agree that "...footnote 17 [of the SCM Agreement] does not carve out upland cotton from the scope of Article 6.3(d) of the SCM Agreement"? (ref. Brazil further submission, para. 275). US
87. The United States is not aware of any "other multilaterally agreed specific rules apply to the trade in the product or commodity in question" within the meaning of footnote 17 to Article 6.3(d) of the Subsidies Agreement.
157. Does the reference to "trade" in footnote 17 of the SCM Agreement have any impact on the interpretation of "world market share" in Article 6.3(d)) If so, what is it? US
88. The use of the term "trade" in footnote 17 provides useful context in interpreting the phrase "world market share" in Article 6.3(d). Specifically, Article 6.3(d) speaks of an increase in a Member's "world market share", not an increase in a Member's "world trade share". By using the term "market" and not "trade", Article 6.3(d) establishes that its scope is not limited to cross-border movements of a primary product or commodity. That is, the "world market" for a primary product or commodity encompasses all the markets in the entire "world", including the market of the allegedly subsidizing Member. Had Members desired instead to restrict the analysis under Article 6.3(d) to cross-border shipments, they could have used the phrase "world trade share" or, in Brazil's preferred formulation, "world export share", or even (as in GATT 1994 Article XVI:3) "world export trade". They did not. Finally, we note that, rather than elaborating on the test under Article 6.3(d), footnote 17 was intended to describe those products or commodities not covered by Article 6.3(d) and therefore could use the term "trade".
158. Please respond to Brazil's assertion that "...the absence of any payment, production or expenditure limitations in the US marketing loan programme is analogous to the EC sugar regime that was challenged in EC - Sugar Exports II (Brazil) and EC - Sugar Exports I (Australia)." (ref. Brazil further submission, para. 317) US
89. The EC sugar export regime challenged by Australia and Brazil under the GATT 1947 was manifestly different than the US marketing loan programme, primarily in that the challenged programme was an export subsidy providing export refunds on exportable surpluses of sugar. The Sugar Exports panel concluded that in the particular market situation prevailing in 1978 and 1979, the EC system had caused serious prejudice to Brazil's interests because it had been applied in a manner which contributed to depress sugar prices. The panel also concluded that the lack of "pre-established effective limitations" on those export refunds and the application of that refund system "constituted a permanent source of uncertainty in world sugar markets and therefore constituted a threat of serious prejudice. The panel's finding on serious prejudice was made carefully, circumscribed by "the particular market situation prevailing in 1978 and 1979". However, the panel's finding on threat of serious prejudice was made without any explanation and apparently without argument by the parties. Therefore, it is difficult to see how the Panel could draw useful guidance from this finding by that panel or draw conclusions on relevant types of payments.
159. The EC, in its oral statement (paras 9 and 10), disagrees with the US interpretation of the terms "same market". Can the US comment on the EC's view? US
90. The United States still has difficulty with the EC view. The United States cannot understand how the "world" can be one "market" for purposes of Article 6.3(c), which by its nature calls for a comparison of the prices of the goods of one Member when competing in a market with the goods of another Member. Goods are not sold to the "world" ­ they are sold in the market of a particular country.
91. The EC on the other hand evidently considers that it is at least possible that the world could function as one market and therefore constitute a "same market" for purposes of analyzing whether

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-258

the "effect of the subsidy" is "significant price suppression [or] depression" of the price of a nonsubsidized product in the same market. For the reasons set forth in the US further submission, the United States considers that such an interpretation would render the "in the same market" language inutile because the subsidized and non-subsidized products could never be found in the same geographic market and still be considered to be in the same "world market". Furthermore, under the EC's approach, a Member could be selling at a price well above another Member's price in the same country, and yet be found to be depressing prices on the "world market" due to a comparison between sales prices of the Member in one country compared to sales prices of the other Member in a different country.

92. However, the EC itself concedes that a "world market" could only be deemed to exist if there were not significant barriers to trade in the product at issue, such as customs duties, technical barriers to trade, etc. The EC's own explanation suggests that such a "world market" is unlikely to exist because of significant barriers to trade somewhere in the world. Thus, even under the EC's approach, it is not the case that there is a "world market" for upland cotton.

160. Without prejudice to the meaning of "world market share" as used in Article 6.3(d) of the SCM Agreement, can you confirm the world export share statistics provided in Exhibit BRA-206? US

93. The table below reflects most recent updates for 2002-03 and 2003-04. We caution that, as noted in the footnotes in the table, the data are drawn from different sources and data sets. Also, we have corrected data in BRA-206 for 1997-98 for total world exports, world upland exports, and US export share.

161. Would a finding of serious prejudice under Article 5(c) of the SCM Agreement be determinative for a finding under Article XVI:1 of the GATT 1994? Why or why not? What, if any, is the role of footnote 13 of the SCM Agreement in this context? BRA, US
94. Article 5(c) establishes that one of the adverse effects that a subsidizing Member should not cause to the interests of other Members is "serious prejudice", and footnote 13 to that Article states that the term "`serious prejudice to the interests of another Member' is used in the same sense as it is used in paragraph 1 of Article XVI of GATT 1994". Therefore, "serious prejudice" under Subsidies Agreement Article 5(c) and GATT 1994 Article XVI:1 must be read to have the same meaning. As Article 5(c), and Article 6 which explains it, are the more detailed provisions on "serious prejudice" and contain a more effective remedy than the consultation envisioned under GATT 1994 Article XVI:1, the Panel's analysis should begin with the Subsidies Agreement provisions. Were the Panel to agree that Brazil has not established that the effect of the challenged subsidy is "serious prejudice" within the meaning of the Subsidies Agreement, it would be difficult to see how the Panel could then determine that "serious prejudice" exists within the meaning of GATT 1994 Article XVI:1 since the term is used "in the same sense" in these provisions.
162. Can the US confirm that marketing loan/LDP, step 2 and counter-cyclical payments are mandatory if the price conditions are fulfilled? US
95. The statutory authority for marketing loan payments, step 2 payments, and counter-cyclical payments does not provide the Secretary with the authority to arbitrarily decline to make these payments to qualified recipients. However, certain conditions must be met before these payments will be made: price conditions must be met, the producer must meet all conditions for payment, including compliance with "sodbuster" and "swampbuster" provisions and any planting restrictions, the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) must not have exhausted its statutory borrowing authority, and Congress must not have cut back on the programme, by an appropriations bill or otherwise.
96. As the question notes, different price conditions apply to each of these payments. For example, in the case of marketing loan payments, the adjusted world price (as calculated by the Department of Agriculture) must be below 52 cents per pound. Recently, the adjusted world price has been above 52 cents per pound and thus no marketing loan payments have been made to qualified recipients.
97. There is no preset limit on the total amount of payments that can be made under each of these programmes although for counter-cyclical payments a maximum total outlay can be calculated using the base acres, base yields, and maximum payment rate for each commodity produced during the historical base period. In addition, for certain recipients, per-person payment limits may apply. We also note that under Section 1601(e) of the 2002 Act, the Secretary has the authority (so-called "circuit breaker" authority) to make adjustments to farm programmes because of WTO domestic support reduction commitments. Presumably, this authority could result in refusals to make certain payments.
98. Conditions for receiving counter-cyclical and marketing loan payments are numerous. The programme contract for counter-cyclical payments is required by section 1105 of the 2002 Act. That section provides explicitly that the producers must agree: (A) to comply with the requirements dealing with the highly erodible cropland conservation found at 16 USC 3811 et seq.; (B) comply with the wetland conservation requirements found at 16 USC 3821 et seq.; (C) comply with the planting flexibility requirement of Section 1106 of the 2002 Act; (D) use the land representing the base acres for an agricultural or conserving use but not for a non-agricultural, commercial, or industrial use, as determined by the Secretary; and (E) control noxious weeds and otherwise maintain the land in accordance with sound agricultural practices as determined by the Secretary of Agriculture, if the agricultural or conserving use involves the noncultivation of any portion of the land as permitted under the specification just set out in (D). For marketing loans, the loan agreement and loan

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-260

regulations, contained in 7 CFR part 1421, specify various conditions that must be met and followed by the producer. Under 16 USC 3811 et seq., the wetland and conservation provisions cited above are made applicable to all commodity benefits, including loans.

163. Are US cotton producers able to cover the fixed and variable costs without subsidies? Please provide substantiating evidence. Of what relevance is this, if any, to Brazil's actionable subsidy claims ? US, BRA
99. The United States notes that even using cost data that reflects 1997 cost structures44, US producers appear to have been able to cover variable costs through the sale of cotton at harvest time in every year but marketing years 2001 and (more narrowly) 2002. In this, US producers were no different than Brazil's farmer witness, Christopher Ward, who stated: "But even with these high yields and the excellent quality of our land, we were not able to fully recover all of our variable costs of production during the 2000/01 and 2001/02 seasons[,]" a position evidently shared by most producers in Mato Grosso, Brazil's leading cotton-producing state.45

100. Furthermore, even in years in which US producers may not have been able to cover fixed and variable costs, it does not follow that it is subsidies that covered these costs. Again, Mr. Ward explained that in marketing years 2000 and 2001, "Nor were we able to meet our total costs which include the additional fixed costs." Therefore, producers can cover costs from revenue sources other than subsidies. That harvest prices at times fall below costs does not necessarily mean that subsidies have had the effect of maintaining production.

K. CAUSATION

164. When the US points, in its oral statement of 7 October, to the alleged "bias" of Prof. Sumner's model, is it arguing that US subsidies are irrelevant to the movement in prices and production (acreage) of upland cotton? US

101. The United States recognizes that subsidies can potentially affect production and prices of upland cotton. The question is one of the nature of the subsidy examined and the degree of any predicted effect, which could range from significant to negligible. The criticisms of Dr. Sumner's model outlined in the US oral statement of October 7, 2002 take issue with many of the underlying

44 Recall that the Department of Agriculture conducted a survey of cotton farmers in 1997. For any cost data published by the Department since that time, the 1997 data has merely been updated by applying the producer price index to `update' input costs. See US Closing Statement at the Second Session of the First Panel Meeting, paras. 10-11.
45 Statement of Mr. Christopher Ward at the Second Session of the First Panel Meeting, para. 6 (emphasis added). Mr. Ward goes on to state: "Based on my discussions with many producers relating to Mato Grosso cotton production and revenue, I know that most other producers in State of Mato Grosso were in the same situation as we were during the 1999-2000 period." (Id (emphasis added)

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-261
assumptions in the model, particularly in regards to how decoupled payments were modelled and the choice of baselines used by Dr. Sumner, which have led to results that have exaggerated the impact of US subsidies on world cotton markets.
165. Please comment (and submit substantiating evidence) on the US assertion that the FAPRI model has been designed and developed for prospective analysis, and is not suitable for retrospective counterfactual analysis. What is the reliability of past FAPRI-produced analyses when compared with actual data for the period covered by them? Is there any other instrument that can be used to try to identify the effect of subsidies already granted, or of their removal? BRA, US
102. FAPRI uses its models for prospective analyses; that is, they analyze the future effects of proposed programme changes against a baseline that assumes current programmes are in place. Recent examples of FAPRI analyses include the effects of stricter payment limitations on US farmers46, an analysis of the European Union's 2003 CAP Reform Agreement47, and the effects on the US dairy industry of removing current Federal regulations.48 These analyses are forward-looking examinations of the effects of policy changes.49
103. Econometric modelling systems similar to the ones maintained by FAPRI and USDA are designed for prospective analyses of alternative policy assumptions. The foundation for forward-looking analyses is the baseline projections, which are conditioned on specific assumptions for exogenous variables, i.e., those that are independent of the modelling system. The baseline model is also conditioned to incorporate the current structure of specific commodity markets through equation specifications, elasticity estimates, and structural shift and dummy variables. As a result, the baseline models will not be appropriately structured to analyze changes over a historical period. For example, models calibrated for the current structure of the US textile industry may not be appropriate to assess the structure present in the late 1990's due to the tremendous changes that have occurred. Another difficulty of using the system over a historical period is the degree of external shocks that impact the model. In prospective analysis, assessing the impacts of alternative policies occurs absent of extreme shocks from independent variables.

49 FAPRI recognizes the forward-looking nature of its analyses and the limitations of those baselines quite clearly:
Each year, FAPRI prepares a set of baseline projections that provide information about the outlook for agricultural markets, farm programme spending, farm income, and a variety of other indicators. The baseline then serves as the point of comparison for analyses of alternative policy options....
The baseline is not a forecast of what will happen, but rather a projection of what could happen under a particular set of assumptions. Current global policies are held in place, even when there is reason to suspect changes are likely....
In reality, these assumptions are certain to be violated and actual market outcomes will differ from the deterministic baseline projections presented in the supply-demand tables....

104. As mentioned by Dr. Sumner in Annex I to Brazil's submission of 30 September, baseline
models such as the one utilized by FAPRI or USDA are not forecasting models. They are used to analyse proposed policy changes.50 The attached table shows the forecast accuracy for year ahead

105. One potential approach to using a baseline model to estimate the effects of subsidies during a historical period would be to use an ex post prospective analysis. Under an ex post analysis, instead of using the current baseline for measurement, one would use a past baseline to make year-ahead projections of the effects of subsidies on the cotton market. For example, to analyze the effects of subsidies on the 1998/99 marketing year, one could use the January 1998 FAPRI baseline model to project the effects of removing subsidies and compare them to baseline levels for the 1998/99 marketing year. To analyze the 1999/00 marketing year, one would update the baseline to the January 1999 baseline and so on, until the current baseline. This would provide baseline comparisons that would reflect the estimated effects of the programmes at the time of planting in each year.

166. The US states that "futures prices demonstrate that market participants predict increasing upland prices over the course of the marketing year" (US 7 October oral statement, para. 62). Please elaborate on this argument including citing specific futures prices. US

106. Exhibit US-68 shows average daily closing prices for the December 2003 cotton futures contract. Daily futures prices for December 2003 and May 2004 delivery have increased by as much as 35 per cent from January 2003 levels.

107. Futures prices reflect a price that a buyer is willing to pay to secure a supply at a given price and protect against the possibility of prices rising even higher. Thus, where futures contract prices are higher than current market prices, the futures prices suggest that cotton buyers are concerned about

50 For example, the US Department of Agriculture explains: The projections are a conditional scenario with no shocks and are based on specific assumptions regarding the macroeconomy, agricultural policy, the weather, and international developments. In particular, the baseline incorporates provisions of the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002 (2002 Farm Act) and assumes that current farm legislation remains in effect through the projections period. The projections are not intended to be a Departmental forecast of what the future will be, but instead a description of what would be expected to happen under a continuation of the 2002 Farm Act, with very specific external circumstances. Thus, the baseline provides a point of departure for discussion of alternative farm sector outcomes that could result under different domestic or international assumptions."

the possibility of cotton prices rising still higher and are willing to lock in a purchase price that carries a premium over current prices.

108. In fact, current futures prices reveal that market participants anticipate upland cotton prices rising over the current 2003 marketing year.

March 2004 contract

That is, a producer may sell cotton futures for December delivery at 82.11 cents per pound, but for
deliver later in marketing year 2003 the price rises to greater than 84 cents per pound. To update the information provided by the United States to the Panel in its further submission52, these futures prices
indicate that the market expects cotton prices to remain well above their 20-year average of 67.86
cents per pound (1983-2002) within the current 2003 marketing year and well above what Brazil
calculates as the 1980-98 A-index average (74 cents per pound) ­ that is, the average for the period before Brazil alleges serious prejudice through significant price suppression or depression.53 Thus,
given expected cotton prices reflected in futures contracts, Brazil has not demonstrated any clearly
foreseen and imminent likelihood of serious prejudice. Quite the contrary: in marketing year 2003,
upland cotton producers expect high and increasing prices.

167. How does Brazil react to Exhibit US-44? BRA

168. Please confirm that the production figures cited in Exhibit US-47 are for upland cotton only and do not include textiles. US

109. Yes, the production figures cited in Exhibit US-47 are for upland cotton production only. They do not include the raw cotton equivalent of textile production.

169. Can the US confirm the accuracy of the facts and figures cited in the four bullet points in paragraph 12 of Brazil's 7 October oral statement? US

110. From paragraph 12 of Brazil's 7 October oral statement:

Between MY 1999-2001, prices received by US upland cotton farmers fell by 34 per cent, yet US production increased by 20.3 per cent. . . . .

Fact check: We can confirm the price and production figures given and would note again Brazil's selective use of marketing year 2001 as the end-point for its comparison. As Brazil complains of effects over marketing years 1999-2002, it would appear that Brazil has simply chosen to use MY2001 figures to inflate the figures it presents.

Between MY 1999-2002, the average US upland cotton farmer would have lost 24.3 cents per pound for every pound of cotton produced if revenue were based only on market revenue. The US response to this huge gap between market prices and costs was to increase

production leading to an increase of US exports by 78.7 per cent and to an increase in the US world market share from 24.1 per cent to 41.6 per cent. . . . .
Fact check: Based on Economic Research Service (ERS) estimates provided in Exhibit US69, the market value of upland cotton (including the value of cottonseed) averaged $325.06 per acre over MY 1999-2002. Operating costs averaged $261.35 per acre over MY 19992002. The value of upland cotton production less operating costs averaged $63.71 per acre. Based on an average upland cotton yield of 577 pounds per planted acre, upland cotton producers received 11.05 cents per pound above their operating costs.
We can confirm the export figure but note that the US share of "world exports" rose from 24.1 per cent in 1999/00 to 39.34 per cent in 2002/03. (See US response to Question 160). In addition, we note that US world market share over the marketing year 1999-2002 period fell from 18.6% in MY1999 to 16.9% in MY2000, rose to 19.8% in MY2001, and fell again to 19.6% in MY2002.54
Between MY 1999-2001, the US dollar appreciated approximately 15 per cent against the currencies of other worldwide cotton producers. . . . US exports increased by 68 per cent. . . ..
Fact check: ERS calculates a commodity-weighted exchange rate index for upland cotton based on the real exchange rates of importing countries, weighted by the share of US cotton exports.55 Based on this index, the dollar appreciated by 6.2 per cent from 1999 to 2001. ERS also calculates a commodity weighted exchange rate index based on the currencies of other cotton producers and their share in world cotton trade. Based on this index, the dollar appreciated by 11 per cent from 1999 to 2001.
Fact check: We can confirm the US upland cotton export figure and again note Brazil's use of marketing year 2001 for its comparison.
US costs of production are much higher than those of most other exporters of upland cotton, yet the US export market share increased from 24.1 per cent to 41.6 per cent between MY 1999-2002.
Fact check: In paras. 284 and 285 of its Further Submission of 9 September 2003, Brazil uses data from the International Cotton Advisory Committee (ICAC) to compare costs of production across countries, which represents the most complete published comparisons of costs of cotton production for major cotton producing countries. Nevertheless, even when good survey data are available for one country, using cost of production data to draw valid economic conclusions is fraught with difficulties. In fact, the ICAC specifically discourages this kind of cross-country comparison: "Because of a number of limitations, it is not advisable to compare the costs of production among several countries at the same time".56
Fact check: Over the period 1999/00 to 2002/03, the US share of world exports rose from 24.1 per cent to 39.34 per cent. (See US response to Question 160).
170. Brazil quotes a report that states that a 10% increase in soybean prices reduces upland cotton acreage by only 0.25% (Brazil's 7 October oral statement, para. 27). Could Brazil indicate if this analysis is done on a short-run basis or a long-run basis? BRA
54 See Exhibit US-47. 55 See Exhibit US-69. 56 Raffiq Chaudhry, International Cotton Advisory Committee, "Cost of Producing Raw Cotton" Presented at the III Brazilian Cotton Congress, Brazil, 31August 2001 (emphasis added).

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-265
171. In paragraphs 22 and 23 of its further submission, we understand that the US is, in short, claiming that increased total supply (i.e. including polyester) drove prices down. On the other hand, we note that, according to the figures in the chart in paragraph 22 of the same submission, the world production of cotton during this period has basically been steady. Do all polyester fibres as represented by these figures compete directly with cotton? That is to say, do these figures for polyester fibres include, for example, those that are used for textiles that technically cannot be substituted by cotton? US
111. The figures in the chart in paragraph 22 represent world polyester textile production. Polyester competes with cotton either directly in the fibre market or indirectly through apparel and other intermediate products.
172. Please estimate the price effect, in cents per pound, of the growth in the US retail market which it is said has directly contributed to strengthening world cotton prices. US
112. As was presented in the table in paragraph 27 of the Further Submission of the United States of 30 September 2003, US retail purchases of raw cotton fibre increased from 12.3 million bales in 1990 to 20.9 million bales in 2002, an increase of 8.6 million bales. This increase accounted for the entire increase in world retail purchases of raw cotton fibre over the same period and reflects an increase at the world level of 10 per cent. Based on the average demand elasticity of -0.25 used by Dr. Sumner in his analysis (see Annex 1 of Brazil's Further Submission to the Panel, para 23), an equivalent price decline of 40 per cent would be necessary to generate a 10 per cent increase in demand of cotton, all else held equal. Of course, this omits other factors such as supply response of world cotton producers and competition of manmade fibres. Nonetheless, it is clear that the growth in retail purchases of cotton fibres in the United States has strengthened world prices.
173. The US asserts that "burgeoning US textile imports ... shifted the disposition of US cotton production from domestic mills to export markets" (US further submission, para. 20). A similar description appears in paragraph 33, together with the explanation that "the share of world cotton consumption supplied by US cotton has been roughly the same since 1991/92". Why have sales of US cotton for export increased and sales of cotton imported into the US increased? US
113. The role and impact of rapidly growing US textile and apparel imports is fundamental in explaining the shift in the use of US cotton production from domestic mills to foreign mills. As noted at paragraphs 20 and 33 of the US further submission, the US textile and apparel industry has suffered from declining competitiveness compared with off-shore producers for many years, reflecting many factors, including higher wage costs, a strong US dollar, etc. As domestic mills have shut down in the United States, and production has moved overseas, domestic demand for US cotton by domestic mills has declined sharply.
114. But US consumer demand for cotton products has not declined. That demand has increasingly been met by lower-priced imports of cotton textiles and apparel. As can be seen in the table following paragraph 34 of the US further submission, US imports of cotton textiles (in cotton equivalents) have more than tripled since 1990. It is important to note that the import, export, and consumption data in that table are expressed in bales of cotton-equivalent. In other words, the data are not "sales of cotton imports", but rather represent the amount of cotton imbedded in the particular products.57
57 These estimates of the "cotton equivalent" of textile imports are done by USDA's Economic Research Service, based an a set of internationally-accepted conversion factors. See Cotton and Wool Situation and Outlook Yearbook. Market and Trade Economics Division, Economic Research Service. US Department of Agriculture, November 2002, CWS-2002.

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-266

115. US cotton is grown to be used to make cotton textiles and apparel. The point of the US submission is to explain how the location of where US cotton is manufactured into products has shifted. US and world consumers continue to purchase cotton products. But increasingly US consumers purchase those cotton products, made from exported US cotton, from overseas manufacturers as US manufacturers are less able to compete. That is the structural transformation that paras. 33-34 and the accompanying table seeks to present and explains at least in part some of the changes in US exports.

174. How, if at all, did the Asian financial crisis affect the United States' world market share? Did it disproportionately affect the US as compared to other exporters? US

116. The Asian financial crisis disrupted cotton consumption (spinning) in the major consuming countries of Thailand, Indonesia, and the Republic of Korea in 1997/98, reducing their mill use 9 per cent from the preceding year. In addition, the decline in world economic growth induced by the crisis reduced total world cotton consumption 3.4 per cent in 1998/99 from the pre-crisis level in 1996/97. Subsequently, however, the depreciation of currencies in these three countries boosted their cotton consumption due to expanding textile exports. World cotton consumption rose 11 per cent between 1996/97 and 2002/03, while consumption in Thailand, Indonesia, and Korea collectively rose 16 per cent. During this same period, US spinners lost market share to textile imports, due in large part to currency effects, and US domestic mill use fell 35 per cent.

117. US export share in these markets is influenced by total supply availability, qualities produced, and price. For example, US export share of the three countries' consumption fell by more than half in 1998/99, due to the drought-devastated US crop. Export share has since returned to the pre-crisis level of about 30 per cent and, with higher consumption, this added about 400,000 bales to US exports between 1996/97 and 2002/03. Since the combined total consumption increase for Thailand, Indonesia, and Korea was about 800,000 bales, this indicates that other exporters also increased exports by about 400,000 bales. As US mill use of cotton declined while exports increased, US world market share was left relatively unchanged (with a slight downward bent) by the Asian financial crisis.

175. With reference to paragraphs 57-58 and the related table on page 21 of the US further submission, could you please clarify the arguments regarding the ratio of the soybean futures to the cotton futures prices since in the table the inverse ratio is used? US

118. Attached is a corrected version of the table. The ratio of cotton futures price to soybean futures prices is positively correlated with movement in planted cotton area.

176. With reference to Figure 4 of Brazil's Further Submission, how does Brazil explain the apparent decrease in prices in 2001 and the increase of the A-Index in recent months, despite the continued use of US subsidies on upland cotton? BRA
177. Could the United States further elaborate on paragraph 50 of its 7 October oral statement? US
119. Lin et al. estimated that the own-price elasticity of cotton acreage under the FAIR Act was 0.466.58 This is identical to the 2003 net-return elasticity reported by Dr. Sumner. However, it is incorrect to equate a price elasticity to net-return elasticity given the linear specification utilized by Dr. Sumner. The implied price elasticity from Dr. Sumner's model would be approximately 50 per cent larger than the net-return elasticity. Larger elasticities imply greater acreage shifts to change in policies or prices.
120. The relationship between the price elasticity and a net revenue elasticity can be shown as follows. Given a linear specification as described by Dr. Sumner, then cotton area (CA) can be expressed:
(1) CA = a0 + a1*CNR + a2*Z, where CNR is Expected Cotton Net Returns and Z is a vector of other variables including returns from competing crops.
The elasticity with respect to CNR is found by differentiating the equation with respect to CNR. The derivative is the coefficient a1. The elasticity, eNR, is expressed as follows:
(2) eNR = a1 * CNR / CA.
With CNR a function of the cotton price P, the elasticity with respect to P can be determined by taking the derivative of the equation with respect to price P. Based on equation (1) from page 13 of Annex I, the derivative with respect to price P is a1*Y, where Y is expected yield.
It follows that the price elasticity is eP = a1 * Y * P / CA. One can then conclude that eNR/eP = ENR / (Y*P).
The relationship between eNR and eP can be found by looking at the relationship between CNR and Y*P. Specifically, eP = ((Y * P) / CNR) * eNR.
In recent years, the ratio of (Y * P) / CNR has been approximately 1.5, implying that eP = 1.5 * eNR = 1.5 * 0.466 = 0.699.
178. The Panel notes Exhibit US-63. Could the US please provide a conceptually analogous graph concerning US export sales during the same period? US
121. Exhibit US-70 shows in table and graph form the per cent change over the previous year for upland cotton exports by the United States and the rest of the world. In addition, the United States provides in Exhibit US-71 a table and graph demonstrating the absolute levels of US exports and domestic consumption. As the figures show, over the last seven years domestic consumption has declined by almost the same amount by which exports have increased, leaving US world market share largely unchanged.

179. Could Brazil comment on the argument that decoupled payments and other subsidies to upland cotton are largely being capitalized into land values and that removing these subsidies would reduce the cost of production of upland cotton producers (US 7 October oral statement, para. 48). What would be the net effect of these adjustments? BRA
180. Please describe the precise formula as to how USDA determines the "adjusted world price" using the Liverpool A-Index, the NY futures price and any other relevant price indicators. Please submit substantiating evidence. BRA, US
122. The Adjusted World Price (AWP) is equal to the Northern Europe (NE) price (the 5-day average of the 5 lowest-priced growths for Middling 1-3/32 inch cotton, cost, insurance and freight [CIF] northern Europe), adjusted to US base quality and average location. The AWP for individual qualities is determined using the schedule of loan premiums and discounts and location differentials. A "coarse count adjustment" (CCA) may be applicable for cotton with a staple length of 1-1/32 inches or shorter and for certain lower grades with a staple length of 1-1/16 inches and longer. The AWP and CCA are announced each Thursday.59
123. A Step 1 adjustment to the AWP may be made when the 5-day average of the lowest US growth quote for Middling 1-3/32 inch cotton, CIF United States-northern Europe (USNE) price, exceeds the NE price and the AWP is less than 115 per cent of the loan level. The Secretary of Agriculture may lower the AWP up to the difference between the USNE price and the NE price. A Step 1 adjustment has never been made, although the conditions have been met many times.
181. Please provide a side-by-side chart of the weekly US adjusted world price, the Liverpool A-Index, the NY futures price, and spot market prices from 1996-present. What, if anything, does this reveal? BRA, US
124. Exhibit Q181 sets out weekly price movements for the Adjusted World Price, the Liverpool A Index, the nearby New York cotton futures price and the spot market price from January 1996 to present.
182. Please explain why the US can be taken to be price leaders, or price setters, (and not just takers) when US producers receive large subsidy payment to support the difference between world prices and their own costs? BRA
L. ARTICLE XVI OF GATT 1994
183. Why does Brazil believe that the appropriate "previous representative period" is the term of the previous Farm Bill, MY1996-2002? (Brazil's further submission, para. 282) BRA
184. Why does Brazil believe that an "equitable share" is one which factors out all subsidies? To the extent that domestic support and export subsidies are permitted by the Agreement on Agriculture, why should they not be accepted as being normal conditions in analyzing an equitable market share? (See Brazil's further submission, paras 288-289) BRA
185. Please respond to the following questions concerning the relationship between Article XVI:3 of the GATT 1994, the disciplines on export subsidies and domestic support in the Agreement on Agriculture and the disciplines on prohibited export subsidies and actionable subsidies in Articles 3, 5(c) and 6.3(d) of the SCM Agreement. BRA, US
(a) Are agricultural domestic support programmes challengeable under Article XVI:3 of the GATT 1994? How, if at all, is the title of Section B of Article XVI ("Additional
59 See Exhibit US-72.

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-269
provisions on export subsidies" (emphasis added)) relevant? How, if at all, are Articles 13 and 21.1, or any other provisions of the Agreement on Agriculture, relevant?
125. As indicated in the US opening statement at the recent panel meeting60, GATT 1994 Article XVI:3 applies only to export subsidies. Paragraph 3 is found in Part B of Article XVI, entitled "Additional Provisions on Export Subsidies", as opposed to Part A, which is entitled "Subsidies in General". Paragraph 2 (also in Part B) states that "[c]ontracting parties recognize that the granting of a subsidy on the export of any product may have harmful effects for other contracting parties" (emphasis added). Paragraph 3 begins with the word "[a]ccordingly", the ordinary meaning of which is "[i]n accordance with the logical premises; correspondingly"61, and follows with "contracting parties should seek to avoid the use of subsidies on the export of primary products" (emphasis added). That is, "in accordance with" the recognition in paragraph 2 that export subsidies may have harmful effects, paragraph 3 address the use of "subsidies on the export of primary products". The second sentence of paragraph 3 follows this hortatory statement with the obligation not to apply subsidies "which operate[] to increase the export of any primary product" in a manner that "results in a contracting party having more than an equitable share of world export trade in that product". Paragraph 4 "[f]urther" addresses export subsidies for "any product other than a primary product". Thus, the text and context of paragraph 3 indicate that this provision is addressed to export subsidies and not domestic support programmes.
126. The Peace Clause provides further context supporting this interpretation. Article 13(c)(ii) exempts export subsidies that conform fully with Part V of the Agreement on Agriculture from, inter alia, "actions based on Article XVI of GATT 1994" ­ that is, including Article XVI:3 on export subsidies. Article 13(b)(ii), on the other hand, exempts conforming domestic support measures from, inter alia, "actions based on paragraph 1 of Article XVI of GATT 1994" but does not mention Article XVI:3. Thus, Article 13 lends contextual support to the notion that Article XVI:3 applies to export subsidies on primary products or commodities but does not apply to domestic subsidies on such products.
(b) Are the requirements of Article XVI:3 of the GATT 1994 reflected in, developed by or subsumed by the requirements in Article 6.3(d) of the SCM Agreement, or in any other provisions of the covered agreements? Of what relevance, if any, is the Appellate Body Report in US-FSC, para. 117 here?
127. Article 6.3(d) of the Subsidies Agreement does not, by its terms, interpret or replace GATT 1994 Article XVI:3. In fact, the range of measures potentially actionable under Article 6.3 is broader than the export subsidies subject to GATT 1994 Article XVI:3. In addition, the analysis under these two provisions is different. Article 6.3(d) is concerned with whether the effect of a subsidy is to increase the world market share of the subsidizing Member; GATT 1994 Article XVI:3 is concerned with whether export subsidies result in a Member having "more than an equitable share in world export trade" in a particular product. However, an important similarity between these two provisions is the scope of products covered by their respective disciplines. GATT 1994 Article XVI:3 is concerned with export subsidies on primary products; Article 6.3(d) is concerned with any subsidy on "a particular subsidized primary product or commodity". This similar product coverage resulted because Members desired to provide more operationally effective subsidies disciplines with respect to these products but had found the "more than equitable share" language of GATT 1994 Article XVI:3 to be unworkable. For further discussion, please see the US response to Question 186 from the Panel.
(c) Of what relevance, if any, is the fact that the definition of "subsidy" in Article 1 of the SCM Agreement and the prohibition on subsidies contingent upon export in
60 US Opening Statement at the Second Session of the First Panel Meeting, para. 60. 61 The New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary, vol. 1, at 15 (1993 ed.) (third definition).

129. Dissatisfaction with the difficulties in applying the "more than equitable share" standard of GATT 1994 Article XVI:3 was an important motivation for the negotiation of stronger and more operational disciplines in the WTO Subsidies Agreement. In two separate challenges in 1979 and 1980 to the sugar export subsidy programme of the European Communities by Australia and Brazil, panels were unable to find that the export refunds provided by the Communities resulted in a "more than equitable share" of world export trade.62 Similarly, in the 1983 US challenge to export subsidies on wheat flour by the European Communities (quoted in the US further submission), "[t]he [p]anel found that it was unable to conclude as to whether the increased [EC] share [of world exports of wheat flour] has resulted in the EEC `having more than an equitable share' in terms of Article 10 [of the Subsidies Code], in light of the highly artificial levels and conditions of trade in wheat flour, the complexity of developments in the markets, including the interplay of a number of special factors, the relative importance of which it was impossible to assess, and, most importantly, the difficulties inherent in the concept of `more than equitable share'".63
130. Significantly, the latter two of these panel reports explicitly considered the 1979 Tokyo Round Subsidies Code and its interpretive gloss on the "more than equitable share language". Article 10.2 of the 1979 Subsidies Code (of which both Brazil and the United States were signatories) stated, in pertinent part:
For purposes of Article XVI:3 of the General Agreement and paragraph 1 above:
(a) "more than an equitable share of world export trade" shall include any case in which the effect of an export subsidy granted by a signatory is to displace the exports of another signatory bearing in mind the developments on world markets;
(b) with regard to new markets traditional patterns of supply of the product concerned to the world market, region or country, in which the new market is situated shall be taken into account in determining `equitable share of world export trade'[.]
That is, the 1979 Subsidies Code represented an effort to make operational the discipline provided in GATT 1994 Article XVI:3 by giving additional meaning to the phrase "more than an equitable share of world export trade". Despite that effort, however, the panel considering the Brazilian challenge to EC sugar export subsidies and the panel considering the US challenge to EC wheat flour export subsidies remained unable to find any inconsistency with GATT 1994 Article XVI:3 (in the words of
62 European Communities ­ Refunds on Exports of Sugar, L/4833, 26S/290 (adopted 6 November 1979) (complaint by Australia); European Communities ­ Refunds on Exports of Sugar, L/5011, 27S/69 (adopted 10 November 1980).

the Wheat Flour panel) "in light of . . . , most importantly, the difficulties inherent in the concept of `more than equitable share'".
131. Thus, there was a recognition in the Uruguay Round subsidies negotiations that the effort in the 1979 Subsidies Code to make GATT 1994 Article XVI:3 more operationally effective had not succeeded. For example, a reference paper on GATT subsidies rules and the existing status of discussion of these rules prepared by the GATT Secretariat for the Negotiating Group on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures states:
The most pronounced difficulties have occurred in connection with the concept of "more than an equitable share" embodied in Article XVI:3 of the GATT. The Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures (Article 10) attempted to bring precision to Article XVI:3 but it has not always been found to give clear guidance on its interpretation. Consequently a number of disputes involving the concept of "more than an equitable share" have not found a satisfactory solution and in some cases have provoked retaliatory subsidization. The case-by-case application of this concept has revealed its imprecisions and the fact that it largely refers to notions which escape objective criteria. There is, for example, sufficient imprecision in this concept to allow countries using export subsidies to argue that these subsidies do not result in obtaining more than equitable share. On the other hand it is not always possible to provide causality between the subsidy and the increase share. Furthermore, it is impossible to derive a general line of case law from the decisions of panels, some of which have given divergent interpretations.64
132. A checklist of issues for the negotiations based on Contracting Parties' written submissions and oral statements prepared by the Secretariat demonstrates that Contracting Parties were well aware of these difficulties and the need to move away from the "more than an equitable share" concept:
There is a need for review, with a view to improving GATT disciplines, of the provisions of Article XVI:2 and 3. Notably there is a need to build on the recognition embodied in Article XVI:2 and the exhortation in the first sentence of XVI:3 in the direction of improving the conditions of competition on world markets for primary products currently covered by the equitable share criterion in the second sentence of Article XVI:3.
The review should examine the application of the "more than an equitable share" rule for primary products. This rule has serious conceptual flaws and in practice has failed to provide clear guidance as to the permissible scope of primary product subsidization. . . . .
The Negotiating Group should consider negotiating a similar prohibition to that of Article 9 of the Code on the use of export subsidies for forest, fishery and farm products.
The prohibition on export subsidies for products other than basic or primary products under Article XVI:4 and Article 9 of the Code should be extended to agricultural, forestry and fishery products, in other words to all basic or primary products.
A major objective of these negotiations should be to extend the existing prohibition on export subsidies to cover all products, primary as well as non-primary.

There are serious deficiencies in Article XVI:3 of the GATT and in Article 10 of the Code, notably the fundamental problems connected with the `more than equitable share' concept. However, these problems arise from the basic fact that current disciplines for primary products are significantly weaker than those which apply to manufactured goods. They cannot be resolved merely by making minor adjustments to rules which are intrinsically defective. The only genuine, long-term solution is an effective prohibition on all export subsidies. Accordingly at this stage of the negotiating process, there is little value in trying to improve the "more than equitable share" rule, which is only relevant so long as there is no general prohibition on export subsidies.65

133. Reflecting the desire of Members to move away from the "more than an equitable share" concept which had repeatedly been found by panels to be incapable of application, the WTO Subsidies Agreement does not provide any further definition or interpretation of GATT 1994 Article XVI:3. Instead, it contains the general prohibition on export subsidies in Article 3 and rules on adverse effects, including serious prejudice.

187. Please provide USDA's projections of marketing loan/LDP payments, direct payments and counter-cyclical payments to be made during MY2003 through 2007 based on the most recent USDA baseline projection. US

134. The following table shows projections for cotton marketing loan/LDP payments, direct payment and counter-cyclical payments for crop years 2003 through 2008, as published in the FY2004 Mid-Session Review on 15 July 2003. We note that projected outlays for marketing year 2003 are likely to be significantly overstated given the increase in prices and futures prices over the course of this marketing year. For example, no marketing loan payments are currently being made because the adjusted world price is above the marketing loan rate.

136. Of significance is the difference between the January 2003 baseline and the preliminary baseline of November 2002 utilized by Dr. Sumner in his analysis. Under the January 2003 baseline, the Adjusted World Price (AWP) forecasts for 2002/03 to 2007/08 are considerably higher than the forecasts made in the preliminary November 2002 baseline. Because loan deficiency payments and marketing loan gains are calculated based on the difference between the loan rate and the AWP, this means that expected marketing loan subsidies under the November 2002 baseline are far higher than expected marketing loan subsidies under the January 2003 baseline. Thus, the effects of eliminating marketing loans would tend to be biased upwards using the preliminary November 2002 baseline.
