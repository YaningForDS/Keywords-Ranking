INDIA ­ CERTAIN TAXES AND OTHER MEASURES ON IMPORTED WINES AND SPIRITS
Request to Join Consultations
Communication from the United States
The following communication, dated 3 October 2008, from the delegation of the United States to the delegation of India, the delegation of the European Communities and to the Chairman of the Dispute Settlement Body, is circulated in accordance with Article 4.11 of the DSU.
_______________
This concerns the request for consultations by the European Communities on India ­ Discriminatory Taxation and Other Measures on the Importation of Wine and Spirits from the European Communities, circulated on 25 September 2008 (WT/DS380/1). My authorities have instructed me to notify the consulting Members and the Dispute Settlement Body of the desire of the United States to be joined in these consultations, pursuant to Article 4.11 of the Understanding on Rules and Procedures Governing the Settlement of Disputes.
The United States has a substantial trade interest in these consultations. The United States is a leading producer and exporter of wine and spirits worldwide. Over the period 2002-2007, US exports of wine (HS headings 2204, 2205, and 2206) and spirits (HS heading 2208) worldwide averaged approximately $750 million and $806 million, respectively, making the United States the world's 6th largest exporter of wine and 3rd largest exporter of spirits.
In addition, the United States is the complaining party in India ­ Additional and ExtraAdditional Duties on Imports from the United States (WT/DS360). That dispute concerns inter alia customs duties that India imposes on imports of wines and spirits and that India alleges are equivalent to taxes imposed by the Indian states on domestic wines and spirits.
