The following communication, dated 27 September 2010, from the delegation of the European Union to the delegation of Canada, the delegation of Japan and to the Chairman of the Dispute Settlement Body, is circulated in accordance with Article 4.11 of the DSU.
_______________
Pursuant to Article 4.11 of the Understanding on Rules and Procedures Governing the Settlement of Disputes, the European Union (EU) hereby notifies the Governments of Canada, of Japan and the Dispute Settlement Body that, in the light of the substantial trade interest of the EU, it desires to be joined in the consultations requested by Japan in a communication circulated to WTO Members on 16 September 2010 (WT/DS412/1 G/L/926 G/TRIMS/D/27 G/SCM/D84/1) entitled "Canada - Certain Measures Affecting the Renewable Energy Generation Sector".
The renewable energy generation sector is of key interest for the EU importers, exporters and investors. At the same time, the EU attaches great importance to the development of renewable energies. Therefore the EU has a substantial trade interest in the present dispute as well as a systemic interest in the correct implementation of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994, the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures and the Agreement on Trade-Related Investment Measures.
The EU looks forward to being informed of the date and venue of the consultations.
