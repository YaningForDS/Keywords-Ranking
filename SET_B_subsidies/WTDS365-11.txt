UNITED STATES ­ DOMESTIC SUPPORT AND EXPORT CREDIT GUARANTEES FOR AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS
Request to Join Consultations
Communication from Nicaragua
The following communication, dated 26 July 2007, from the delegation of Nicaragua to the delegation of the United States, the delegation of Brazil and to the Chairman of the Dispute Settlement Body, is circulated in accordance with Article 4.11 of the DSU.
_______________
Pursuant to paragraphs 10 and 11 of Article 4 of the Understanding on Rules and Procedures Governing the Settlement of Disputes (DSU), the Government of Nicaragua hereby notifies its interest to be joined in the consultations requested by the Government of Brazil under Articles 1 and 4 of the DSU, Article XXII of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994, Articles 4 and 30 of the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures, and Article 19 of the Agreement on Agriculture, regarding certain specified domestic support payments and export credit guarantees being provided by the US government to US producers and/or exporters of agricultural products. (WT/DS365/1, G/L/823, G/SCM/D76/1, and G/AG/GEN/75).
Peanuts are a US product covered by the Countercyclical Payments, Direct Payments, Loan Deficiency Payments and Nonrecourse Marketing Assistance Loans raised in part one of Brazil's consultation request and specifically listed in Annex I to its request. Nicaragua's second largest agricultural export is peanuts. Because the listed payments, as applied to peanuts, are undermining Nicaragua's peanut exports and contributing to the amount by which the United States is exceeding its Aggregate Measure of Support, Nicaragua respectfully asks that its "substantial trade interest" in these consultations be recognized.
