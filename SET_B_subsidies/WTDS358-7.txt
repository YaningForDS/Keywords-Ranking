Request to Join Further Consultations
Communication from Mexico
The following communication, dated 4 May 2007, from the delegation of Mexico to the delegation of China, the delegation of the United States and to the Chairman of the Dispute Settlement Body, is circulated in accordance with Article 4.11 of the DSU.
_______________
My authorities have instructed me to request, pursuant to Article 4.11 of the WTO Understanding on Rules and Procedures Governing the Settlement of Disputes, that Mexico be joined in the consultations requested by the United States on 27 April 2007 in a communication circulated to Members on 2 May 2007 which states that during the said consultations, supplemental consultations were requested with regard to "certain measures granting refunds, reductions, or exemptions from taxes or other payments otherwise due to the government by enterprises in China".
As a recipient of foreign investment and a major importer of products from China in the sectors identified in the United States' request for consultations, Mexico has a substantial trade interest in this case, and would be most grateful if its request were given due consideration.
