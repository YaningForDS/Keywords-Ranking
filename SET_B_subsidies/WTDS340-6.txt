CHINA ­ MEASURES AFFECTING IMPORTS OF AUTOMOBILE PARTS
Request to Join Consultations
Communication from Canada
The following communication, dated 13 April 2006, from the delegation of Canada to the delegation of China, the delegation of the United States and to the Chairman of the Dispute Settlement Body, is circulated in accordance with Article 4.11 of the DSU.
_______________
Pursuant to Article 4.11 of the Understanding on Rules and Procedures Governing the Settlement of Disputes ("DSU"), the Government of Canada hereby notifies its desire to be joined in consultations requested by the United States pursuant to Articles 1 and 4 of the DSU, Article XXII:1 of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994 (GATT 1994), Article 8 of the Agreement on Trade-Related Investment Measures (TRIMs Agreement) and Articles 4 and 30 of the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures (SCM Agreement), with respect to China's importation of automobile parts from the United States. The relevant communication to the delegation of the People's Republic of China from the delegation of the United States, dated 30 March 2006, was circulated to WTO Members on 3 April 2006 (WT/DS340/1, G/L/771, G/TRIMS/D/23 and G/SCM/D68/1). Canada has also requested consultations in respect of this matter.
Canada has a substantial trade interest in these proceedings as a major exporter of automobile parts to China. Chinese imports of Canadian automobile parts represent a market worth on average Can$256 million between 2003 and 2005 to Canadian manufacturers. The measures at issue appear to penalize the use of imported automobile parts in the manufacture of vehicles for sale in China. Accordingly, Canada requests to be joined in these consultations.
