UNITED STATES ­ DOMESTIC SUPPORT AND EXPORT CREDIT GUARANTEES FOR AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS
Request for Consultations by Brazil
The following communication, dated 11 July 2007, from the delegation of Brazil to the delegation of the United States and to the Chairman of the Dispute Settlement Body, is circulated in accordance with Article 4.4 of the DSU.
_______________
My authorities have instructed me to request consultations with the Government of the United States pursuant to Articles 1 and 4 of the Understanding on Rules and Procedures Governing the Settlement of Disputes ("DSU"), Article XXII of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994 (GATT 1994), Articles 4 and 30 of the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures (SCM Agreement), and Article 19 of the Agreement on Agriculture.
2. This request comprises two parts.
I. The measures at issue in the first part of Brazil's Request for Consultations are as follows:
(a) for the years1 1999, 2000 and 2001: all domestic support measures in favour of agricultural producers, within the meaning of Article 6.1 of the Agreement on Agriculture notified by the United States in the notifications of its domestic support2 (the "Notifications") as part of its Aggregate Measurements of Support for those years, as well as the programs, legislation, regulations and other instruments by which any support was provided, as set forth in Title 7 of the US Code3 and Title 7 of the US Code of Federal Regulations,4 as well as the additional non-notified programs and support provided thereunder:
· Production Flexibility Contract payments5 for each of wheat, corn, grain sorghum, barley, oats, upland cotton, and rice; Non-insured Crop Disaster Assistance

1 In this request, "year" has the meaning assigned to it in Article 1(i) of the Agreement on Agriculture. 2 G/AG/N/USA/43 of 5 February 2003 for year 1999 and G/AG/N/USA/51 of 17 March 2004 for years
2000 and 2001. 3 Including Chapters 21C, 26, 35, 35A, 36, 38, 50, 55, 58, 63, 68, 76, 77, 79, 80, 82, 87, 89, 90, 91, 92,
97, 99, 100, 101, 105, 106, 107 and 108. 4 Including Chapters IV, VII, IX, X, XI, XIV, and XV. 5 Subtitle B, Title I, Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform Act of 1996, Public Law 104-127.

payments;6 Crop Disaster payments;7 Emergency Feed8 and other feed program payments for each of beef and veal, dairy, hogs and pigs, sheep and lamb, and all other livestock; Livestock Indemnity9 payments for each of beef and veal, dairy, hogs and pigs, sheep and lamb, and all other livestock; Tree Assistance Program payments10 for each of apples, apricots, peaches, pears, and all other trees, bushes and vines; programs providing various forms of credit for US agricultural producers;11 programs exempting US agricultural producers from payment of gasoline and diesel fuel taxes;12 programs exempting US agricultural producers from tax based on overall farm income13; subsidies related to the operation and maintenance of irrigation works by the US Department of the Interior.14
· Any other non-notified domestic support measure or subsidies, and any other legislation, regulations and other instruments by which that support or those subsidies were provided or granted, that are not properly exempted from the US reduction commitments made pursuant to the terms of Article 6 of the Agreement on Agriculture.
(b) for the years 2002, 2004 and 2005, during which years the United States made no notifications of the domestic support included in its Total Aggregate Measurements of Support:
6 Section 109, Agricultural Risk Protection Act of 2000, Public Law 106-224; Federal Crop Insurance Reform Act of 1994.
7 "Food Security Act of 1985, Disaster Assistance Acts of 1988 and 1989 and subsequently" [sic]; Fiscal Year 2000 Appropriations Act, Public Law 106-78, October 22, 1999.
8 Notification G/AG/N/USA/43 indicates no public law or other references for this program. Notification G/AG/N/USA/51 lists several public law references but does not indicate which ones apply specifically to this program.
9 Notification G/AG/N/USA/43 indicates no public law or other references for this program. Notification G/AG/N/USA/51 lists several public law references but does not indicate which ones apply specifically to this program.
10 Notification G/AG/N/USA/43 refers to descriptions in the "1988 and subsequent disaster assistance acts". Notification G/AG/N/USA/51 seems to refer to the Disaster Assistance Act of 1988, Public Law 100-387, and also to "Public Law 105-174, May 1, 1998", whose name appears to be "1998 Supplementary Appropriations and Rescissions Act" and in which Title II identifies a "Tree assistance program".
11 The guaranteed loans program provides lenders (e.g., banks, Farm Credit System institutions, credit unions) with a guarantee of payment should the borrower default on the loan. The guarantee permits lenders to offer loans to farmers who would not otherwise be eligible for credit. See "Expect More Program Assessment of the Agriculture Credit Insurance Fund," available at http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/expectmore/detail/10001009.2003.html. Given the United States' failure to notify these measures, Brazil is unable to identify the precise statutory or regulatory provisions at issue, but anticipates that the United States will provide such information during consultations.
12 Diesel fuel and gasoline used on farms are exempt from various excise and sales taxes. See e.g., Diesel Fuel Tax Exemption 26 U.S.C. §4041(f) and Gasoline Tax Exemption 27 U.S.C. §6420.
13 Including deductions from taxable incomes from farming, farmers' marketing and purchasing cooperatives and export transactions of agricultural commodities.
14 The OECD defines these subsidies as a proportion (38.7 per cent) of the annual expenditure of the Bureau of Reclamation (US Department of the Interior) estimated to apply to the construction, operation and maintenance of irrigation works for agriculture. Details available in Section III.E.1 of OECD "United States: Estimates of Support to Agriculture", available at http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/11/24/37003207.htm. Given the United States' failure to notify these measures, Brazil is unable to identify the precise statutory or regulatory provisions at issue, but anticipates that the United States will provide such information during consultations.

· all domestic support measures in favour of agricultural producers within the meaning of Article 6.1 of the Agreement on Agriculture, and the programs, legislation, regulations and instruments by which that support was provided, as set forth in Title 7 of the US Code15 and Title 7 of the US Code of Federal Regulations,16 including the measures identified in the Annex I to this request; and
· Any other domestic support measure or subsidies, and any other legislation, regulations and other instruments by which that support or those subsidies were provided or granted, that are not properly exempted from the US reduction commitments made pursuant to the terms of Article 6 of the Agreement on Agriculture.
3. Pursuant to Article 3.2 of the Agreement on Agriculture, the United States committed that it would limit its Total Aggregate Measurement of Support to the annual levels specified in section I of Part IV of Schedule XX of the United States: for the year 1999 USD 19,899.264 million and for each subsequent year USD 19,103.294 million. Despite these commitments, the United States' Current Total Aggregate Measurement of Support appears to have exceeded its commitment levels in each of the years 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2004 and 2005 in violation of Article 3.2.
4. For the years 1999, 2000, and 2001, the Notifications of the United States purport to show that its domestic support did not exceed its commitment levels. However, in its Notifications, the United States failed to include in its Aggregate Measurements of Support certain non-exempt domestic support measures that the United States provided, within the meaning of Article 6.1 of the Agreement on Agriculture as described above. The United States also failed to properly notify certain of the measures identified under (a) above which must be included in the United States' Total Aggregate Measurement of Support. Among other aspects of the Notifications that understated the Total Aggregate Measurement of Support, the United States:
· incorrectly claimed that its Production Flexibility Contract payments conformed to the criteria for Decoupled income support (paragraph 6 of Annex 2 of the Agreement on Agriculture);
· incorrectly claimed that payments under its Non-insured Crop Disaster Assistance, Crop Disaster Assistance, Emergency Feed, Livestock Indemnity, and Tree Assistance programs conformed to the criteria for Payments for relief from natural disasters (paragraph 8 of Annex 2 of the Agreement on Agriculture);
· incorrectly included its crop Market Loss Assistance payments17 in its non-productspecific Aggregate Measurement of Support instead of product-specific Aggregate Measurements of Support (paragraph 1 of Annex 3 of the Agreement on Agriculture).
5. For each of the years 1999, 2000 and 2001, the domestic support that the United States provided, and which constituted its Current Total Aggregate Measurement of Support, exceeded its commitment levels, contrary to Article 3.2 of the Agreement on Agriculture.
15 Including Chapters 21C, 26, 35, 35A, 36, 38, 50, 55, 58, 63, 68, 76, 77, 79, 80, 82, 87, 89, 90, 91, 92, 97, 99, 100, 101, 105, 106, 107 and 108.
16 Including Chapters IV, VII, IX, X, XI, XIV, and XV. 17 Section 802, Subtitle A, Title VIII , Emergency and Disaster Assistance for Producers, Public Law 106-78; Agricultural Risk Protection Act of 2000, Public Law 106-224. The Notifications refer to crop Market Loss Assistance payments as "Crop market loss assistance payments", "market loss payments (MLP)", and "market loss payments (MLA)".

WT/DS365/1, G/L/823, G/SCM/D76/1, G/AG/GEN/75 Page 4
6. Although the United States has not notified its domestic support since 2001, for each of the years 2002, 2004 and 2005, available public information indicates that the domestic support that the United States provided and which constituted its Current Total Aggregate Measurement of Support also exceeded its commitment levels, contrary to Article 3.2 of the Agreement on Agriculture.
7. Given the US failure to notify any domestic support programs after 2001, Brazil has endeavored to identify as many domestic support measures as possible for the purposes of this consultation request in view of available public sources. These are set forth in the Annex I to this request and/or are referenced above. However, in view of the nature of the affirmative US obligation under Article 3.2 of the Agreement on Agriculture not to exceed its commitment levels, coupled with the US failure to notify its domestic support programs after 2001, it is sufficient (and, indeed, the most that Brazil can be expected to do) for purposes of this consultation request, for the years subsequent to 2001, to describe the general universe of domestic support measures provided for in US legislation, regulations and other instruments by which domestic support or subsidies were provided or granted, and that are not properly exempted from the US reduction commitments made pursuant to the terms of Article 6 of the Agreement on Agriculture.
II. The measures at issue in the second part of Brazil's Request for Consultations are as follows:
· Export credit guarantee programs under the Agricultural Trade Act of 1978 and other measures such as the General Sales Manager 102 ("GSM 102") program and the Supplier Credit Guarantee Program ("SCGP"), as well as other statutory and regulatory instruments providing the guarantees, and guarantees provided under those programs or other measures, in respect of agricultural products for which the United States has made export subsidy reduction commitments in Section II of Part IV of the Schedule of the United States ("scheduled products"), and in respect of all other agricultural products ("unscheduled products").
8. Through these measures, the United States makes available export credit guarantees, contingent on the export of US agricultural products, at premium rates and on other terms more favourable than those which are otherwise available in the market. These measures therefore constitute export subsidies under the Agreement on Agriculture and the SCM Agreement. The United States provides these export subsidies: (i) in excess of its export subsidy reduction commitments for scheduled products; and, (ii) for unscheduled products. These measures therefore violate Articles 3.3, 8, 9.1 and 10.1 of the Agreement on Agriculture. Additionally, these measures are prohibited export subsidies contrary to Article 3.1(a) and 3.2 of the SCM Agreement.
9. In respect of Part II of this request for consultations, Article 4.2 of the SCM Agreement requires the inclusion of a statement of available evidence with regard to the existence and nature of the subsidies in question. The Annex II to this request contains Brazil's statement of available evidence.
10. Brazil looks forward to receiving the United States' reply to this request and to selecting a mutually acceptable date on which consultations may take place. Brazil also expects that the United States will supply information during the consultations regarding all of its domestic support measures existing in 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2004, and 2005, as well as on the measures at issue in the second part of this request for consultations.
