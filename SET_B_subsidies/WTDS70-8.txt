CANADA ­ MEASURES AFFECTING THE EXPORT OF CIVILIAN AIRCRAFT
Status Report by Canada
The following communication, dated 18 November 1999, from the Permanent Mission of Canada to the Dispute Settlement Body, is circulated pursuant to Article 21.6 of the DSU.
_______________
Status Report on the Implementation of the Recommendations and Rulings in the Dispute regarding
Canada ­ Measures Affecting the Export of Civilian Aircraft
In the interest of transparency, Canada wishes to inform the Dispute Settlement Body (DSB) of its implementation of the recommendations and rulings in the dispute regarding "Canada Measures Affecting the Export of Civilian Aircraft" (WT/DS70/R and WT/DS70/AB/R). Canada was required to have implemented the DSB rulings in this dispute by 18 November 1999. We have done so.
With respect to Canada Account debt financing for the export of Canadian regional aircraft, which was found to be inconsistent with Canada's obligations under the SCM Agreement, Canada wishes to inform the DSB that there will be no deliveries of regional aircraft after 18 November 1999 benefiting from such Canada Account financing. In addition, the Minister for International Trade has approved a policy guideline which requires that all future Canada Account transactions for all sectors, not only those involving the regional aircraft sector, comply with the OECD Arrangement on Guidelines for Officially Supported Export Credits. By this policy, the Minister undertakes not to authorize any transaction under the Canada Account unless it complies with the Arrangement. No Canada Account transaction may proceed without such Ministerial authorization.
On the matter of Technology Partnerships Canada (TPC) assistance to the Canadian regional aircraft industry which was found to be inconsistent with Canada's obligations under the SCM Agreement, Canada wishes to inform the DSB that it will not make any disbursements pursuant to any existing TPC Contribution Agreement for the Canadian regional aircraft industry effective 18 November 1999. In this respect, Canada has amended TPC's Contribution Agreements pertaining to the Canadian regional aircraft industry in order to terminate all obligations to disburse funds effective 18 November. As a result, some $16.4 million of funding pursuant to those agreements will go undisbursed. In addition, Canada has cancelled the conditional approval given prior to the Appellate Body report for two other regional aircraft industry projects. Attached, please find copies of letters confirming cancellation of such funding.

WT/DS70/8 Page 2
Canada has also taken steps to restructure TPC in order to bring the structure and administrative practices of the Agency into conformity with the SCM Agreement and so to avoid future disputes in this matter. TPC has been re-mandated by the government and now operates under revised Terms and Conditions and Framework Document. Revisions have covered such core activities as project eligibility, assessment criteria, and repayment principles.
Canada has implemented the DSB's rulings to withdraw the measures within 90 days.

Re: Technology Partnership Canada (TPC) Application # 710-122427
Dear Mr. O'Blennis:
The World Trade Organization (WTO) has found that support under Technology Partnerships Canada to the regional aircraft industry was inconsistent with WTO rules. The ruling obligates Canada to withdraw assistance to the regional aircraft industry as of 18 November 1999. Minister Manley has announced the government's intent to comply with the ruling and undertook not to approve any new regional aircraft related projects until such time as the program is restructured in order to ensure that future transactions are compliant with WTO.
Since your application received approval-in-principle on 3 July 1998 and relates to the regional aircraft industry, we have determined that it will not be possible to proceed with the contracting of your project. Accordingly, your file will be closed effective 17 November 1999.
Further to our discussions, please return a signed copy of this letter to the undersigned by 15 November 1999 acknowledging that the Minister has no obligation to AlliedSignal Canada Inc. pursuant to this matter. We regret any difficulty that this decision may cause and appreciate your cooperation. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact us.
Yours truly,

(Signed) James Roberge Deputy Executive Director Director, Aerospace and Defence
