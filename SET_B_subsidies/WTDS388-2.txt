Request to Join Consultations
Communication from the European Communities
The following communication, dated 15 January 2009, from the delegation of the European Communities to the delegation of China, the delegation Mexico, and to the Chairman of the Dispute Settlement Body, is circulated in accordance with Article 4.11 of the DSU.
_______________
Pursuant to Article 4.11 of the Understanding on Rules and Procedures Governing the Settlement of Disputes (DSU), the European Communities hereby notifies the Government of Mexico, the Government of China, and the Dispute Settlement Body that, in the light of the substantial trade interest of the European Communities, it desires to be joined in the consultations requested by Mexico in a communication circulated to WTO Members on 8 January 2009 (WT/DS388/1, G/L/880, G/SCM/D82/1, G/AG/GEN/80) entitled China ­ Grants, Loans and Other Incentives.
The European Communities has a significant and growing trading relationship with China and exports from China to the European Communities may be assumed to be affected by the measures challenged by Mexico. China is currently the European Communities' second largest trading partner and the biggest source of imports. The European Communities is China's biggest trading partner. From 2004 to 2007 the overall import value of Chinese goods into the European Communities increased from 128,7 billion EUROS to 232,6 billion EUROS. A significant share of these imports appears to be potentially affected by the challenged measures. The European Communities therefore has a substantial trade interest in the present dispute.
The European Communities looks forward to being informed of the date and venue of the consultations.
