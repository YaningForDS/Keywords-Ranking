COMMUNICATION FROM THE APPELLATE BODY
The following notification, dated 4 April 2013, from the Chair of the Appellate Body addressed to the Chair of the Dispute Settlement Body, is circulated to Members in accordance with Article 17.5 of the Understanding on Rules and Procedures Governing the Settlement of Disputes.
_______________
I am writing to you pursuant to Article 17.5 of the Understanding on Rules and Procedures Governing the Settlement of Disputes, which stipulates that, as a general rule, the Appellate Body will circulate its report no later than 60 days after the appellant has formally notified the Dispute Settlement Body (DSB) of its decision to appeal. Article 17.5 states furthermore that, when the Appellate Body considers that it cannot provide its report within 60 days, it shall inform the DSB in writing of the reasons for the delay together with an estimate of the period within which it will submit its report.
Canada notified the DSB on 5 February 2013 of its decision to appeal certain issues of law covered in the Panel Reports and legal interpretations developed by the Panel in the above disputes. Due to the time required for completion and translation of the Reports of the Appellate Body, it will not be able to circulate its Reports within 60 days. We estimate that the Appellate Body Reports in this appeal will be circulated to WTO Members no later than Monday, 6 May 2013, which is 90 days after the appeal was filed.
