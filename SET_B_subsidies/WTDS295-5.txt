Article 12.9 of the DSU states that when a panel considers that it cannot issue its report within six months, it shall inform the DSB in writing of the reasons for the delay, together with an estimate of the period within which it will issue its report.
The Panel on Mexico ­ Definitive Anti-Dumping Measures on Beef and Rice (WT/DS295) was established by the DSB on 7 November 2003 and composed on 13 February 2004.
Further to our communication to you of 11 August 2004 under Article 12.9 of the DSU, the Panel now expects to complete its work in March 2005. This date takes account of issues related to translation into Spanish and English of all relevant documents and the time needed to translate the interim report into Spanish, as agreed with the parties, prior to its issuance.
