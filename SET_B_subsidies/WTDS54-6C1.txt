INDONESIA - CERTAIN MEASURES AFFECTING THE AUTOMOBILE INDUSTRY
Request for the Establishment of a Panel by the European Communities
Corrigendum
In document WT/DS54/6, dated 13 May 1997, paragraph (iii) appearing on page two should be replaced with the following text:
(iii) the measures described under points (a), (b), (e) and (f) do not provide unconditionally the same benefits with respect to the imposition of import duties and internal taxes to motor vehicles, and to parts and components thereof, originating in the European Communities than to like products originating in other countries and are, therefore, inconsistent with Article I:1 of GATT.
