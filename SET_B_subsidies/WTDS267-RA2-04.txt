I. BRAZIL'S INTRODUCTORY COMMENTS
1. Brazil's response to the US 22 December 2003 Comments Concerning Brazil's Econometric Model ("US Critique") is divided into two parts. First, Brazil provides some introductory comments setting the US Critique into perspective. And, second, Brazil offers Professor Sumner's detailed response to the US critique.
2. The United States Critique initially focuses on proving a point that has never been contested by Brazil, i.e., that the Sumner model is not exactly like the FAPRI model. As Professor Sumner points out, he never claimed that his model was identical to the FAPRI model. The United States points to no contradictions between what Professor Babcock has stated and what Professor Sumner stated in Annex I or his other statements concerning the links between his model and the FAPRI model. Nevertheless, while there are differences between the Sumner model and the FAPRI model, the record is undisputed that the core elements of the FAPRI model ­ the hundreds of demand and supply equations ­ are identical. The differences in Professor Sumner's model are primarily the result of his use of the CARD international cotton model and additions to the FAPRI model made by Professor Sumner. The additions were necessary to enable the FAPRI/CARD modelling framework to respond to the questions before this Panel.
3. The United States Critique asserts that Professor Sumner's choice of baselines has prejudiced the outcome to such an extent that his results are not usable.1 But the record shows that the significant acreage, production, export and price effects found in Professor Sumner's Annex I results using the CARD international cotton model and the amended FAPRI US crops model based off the (recalibrated) FAPRI preliminary November 2002 baseline are essentially the same even when used against other baselines.2 The United States first argued that Professor Sumner should have used the FAPRI 2003 baseline.3 Professor Sumner responded by running his model on that later baseline.4 There were no significant changes between Annex I and those results for either the period from MY 1999-2002 or in the period from MY 2003-2007.5 The United States Critique raises a new argument that Professor Sumner manipulated the FAPRI preliminary November 2002 baseline.6 This allegation is wrong. Any differences are the result of a necessary recalibration of the model following the use of the CARD international cotton model rather than the FAPRI international crops models and some update incorporating more recent macroeconomic data.7 As Professor Sumner demonstrates below, there are no significant differences with his Annex I result by using this slightly modified baseline.8 Indeed, the fact that Professor Sumner's simulation model generates nearly identical results regardless of the baselines used demonstrates the robustness of the Sumner model.
4. In criticizing Professor Sumner's modelling of the four different types of contract payments, the United States repeats its baseless arguments that the contract payments have absolutely no effect on production decisions for upland cotton. The notion that an estimated9 $4.7 billion10 of amber box

Brazil hopes that the United States will produce the data on 20 January 2004.

(presumptively trade- and production-distorting) subsidies paid to current producers of upland cotton and allocated as support to upland cotton had no effect on upland cotton production has been, and remains today, incredible. The United States has never explained why upland cotton base acreage payments are so much higher than other programme crops (except rice). The obvious reason is that Congress and the NCC expected the bulk of acreage historically planted to upland cotton to continue to be planted to upland cotton, a high-cost crop. Nor has the United States been able to explain how there could be no production effects when US upland cotton producers would have lost $332.79 per acre over a six-year period if they had received no contract payments.11 NCC representatives stated that these payments were "critically needed"12 to "make ends meet"13, i.e., to cover their cost of production.
5. In fact, Professor Sumner has been, in the view of Brazil, probably overly conservative in his estimation of the effects of these contract payments on US upland cotton production. Brazil notes that the nature of Professor Sumner's modelling does not permit an assessment of the cumulative losses such as the $332.79 per acre over a six-year period. Even Professor Sumner acknowledges that his use of only $0.25 of each direct payment dollar as having production effects is probably low in light of the obvious impact of this subsidy in supporting the continued survival of many US producers.14 Similarly, Professor Sumner's use of only $0.40 of each counter-cyclical payment dollar as having production effects15 is also low in light of the fact that $1 billion in payments in MY 2002 were crucial to the economic survival of many upland cotton producers. In light of the evidence produced by Brazil, the US Critique that Professor Sumner's analysis is fundamentally wrong for not concluding that these huge subsidies, filling almost half of the cost-revenue gap, have no effects is completely unjustified.
6. The United States Critique also expresses amazement that Professor Sumner could attempt to model the effects of export credit guarantees. The fact that FAPRI has not yet modelled this subsidy is completely irrelevant. Nor is Professor Sumner blazing new economic ground by modelling export credit guarantees. The NCC has a team of economists working with the United States on this dispute, headed by Gary Adams, a former FAPRI economist who worked on the FAPRI upland cotton model.16 NCC economists concluded in 2001 that major changes to the GSM 102 programme would result in 500,000 fewer bales being exported from the United States and result in a 3 cent per pound increase in prices.17 It is curious that the United States, assisted by NCC economists, now seeks to contradict the conclusions of the beneficiaries of this GSM 102 programme by asserting that there were no production, export or price effects from this subsidy. The NCC's 2001 findings, which Professor Sumner used conservatively to estimate the production, export and price effects of the export credit guarantee programmes, was supported by the fact that $1.6 billion in US upland cotton exports between MY 1998-2002 were covered by GSM 102 export credit guarantees.18 Further support for the NCC's 2001 estimate comes from the US Congressional Research Service that concluded that guarantees have "mainly benefited exports of wheat, wheat flour, oilseeds, feed grains

and cotton".19 Andrew Macdonald has also testified to the export-enhancing effects of the US GSM 102 programme.20 In its evaluation of the US Critique's claim that Professor Sumner ­ and the 2001 NCC economists ­ incorrectly estimated the effects of removing the GSM 102 subsidies, the Panel must consider this uncontested evidence.
7. The United States Critique also challenges Professor Sumner's modelling of the effects of removing crop insurance subsidies. The US Critique focuses primarily on the fact that FAPRI has not yet modelled these subsidies.21 But this is irrelevant. What is relevant are the facts which show that $788 million in crop insurance subsidies were provided to upland cotton producers between MY 1999-2002.22 And it is relevant that USDA's own economists found that lower pre-2000 ARP Act crop insurance subsidies had significant production and price effects for upland cotton (as opposed to other programme crops).23 Current higher crop insurance benefits under the 2000 ARP Act would certainly have higher effects. Professor Sumner's crop insurance modelling is also consistent with USDA's own economists' conclusion that the "availability of subsidized crop insurance affects farmers' current crop production decisions by creating a direct incentive to expand production".24 It is uncontested that the amount of crop insurance subsidies received by upland cotton producers is directly related to the amount of upland cotton they plant.25 Given this evidence, it was reasonable for Professor Sumner to conclude that each dollar of crop insurance subsidies had direct effects on US production.
8. With respect to Professor Sumner's modelling of marketing loan payments, the US Critique is essentially silent.26 This silence is no doubt due to the fact that Professor Sumner's model uses exactly the same elasticities and estimates of effects as the FAPRI model, for which the United States has indicated it has no objection.27 Further, Professor Sumner's findings regarding the effects of marketing loan payments between MY 1999-2002 are very much consistent with those of Westcott/Price who found that in MY 2001 that marketing loan payments caused 3 million additional acres to be planted to upland cotton with an implied price decline of 10 cents per pound (or 33 percent of the MY 2001 price).28 Brazil has already addressed the various US critiques of the use of so-called "lagged prices" by noting that USDA, FAPRI, Professor Sumner and a host of other economists have used these prices in countless models and that any use of futures market prices in large-scale simulation models is impossible.29 Further, the faulty and primitive US futures methodology for estimating the production effects of marketing loan programmes is no substitute for the comprehensive models used by USDA, FAPRI and Professor Sumner.30 Most pointedly, the US futures methodology suffers from the fatal flaw that it does not even focus on the price that does get

the attention of US producers who depend on marketing loan payments ­ the adjusted world price (AWP).31
9. Nor does the US Critique find any fault with Professor Sumner's analysis of the Step 2 subsidies.32 Brazil notes that Professor Sumner models the effects of Step 2 domestic and export subsidies in exactly the same manner as FAPRI. Professor Sumner's Step 2 analysis is also completely consistent with the overwhelming evidence that Step 2 export and domestic subsidies have significant production, export, and world price effects. As with the GSM 102 subsidies, the NCC has been quite vocal in praising the production and export effects of the Step 2 subsidies.33 There would simply be no basis for the United States to contradict these testimonies from the users and beneficiaries of the Step 2 programme.
10. The Panel must also assess the validity of the US critique in view of the overwhelming noneconometric evidence that the US subsidies had significant production, export and price effects.34 For example, the Panel must ask whether it is reasonable to conclude, as the United States argues, that $12.9 billion dollars in amber box, presumed trade-distorting subsidies had no effect on US production, US exports, and world prices. It is further uncontested that USDA's own data shows that the average US upland cotton farm would have lost $872 per acre during MY 1997-2002 ­ but had a "profit" of $106 per acre when subsidies are included in their revenue.
11. Further, the Panel must also examine the US Critique of Professor Sumner's analysis in light of the evidence of other econometric studies examining the effects of removing US upland cotton subsidies. The United States has argued that all these studies ­ including USDA's studies ­ were wrong in finding significant production, export, and price effects. Would the United States also argue that all of these other economists analyzed the US upland cotton subsidies and their effects on the (world) upland cotton market "for the express purpose of achieving pre-conceived results"?35 Brazil submits that a common sense analysis of these other studies, including USDA's own studies, shows that Professor Sumner's results are both valid as well as conservative. They are certainly within the ranges of the other econometric studies in the record and consistent with what would be expected given the non-econometric evidence in the record.
12. Finally, Brazil notes US suggestions that Professor Sumner made modelling choices "for the express purpose of achieving pre-conceived results"36 and "in order to exaggerate acreage and ultimately price impacts".37 These are offensive and inappropriate charges directed at one of the world's leading agricultural economists. Members of the NCC admitted that "Dr. Sumner is a brilliant economist" who is "well-respected" and a "widely recognized UC [University of California] economist" who is a "confidant to the administration on trade and other issues".38 Personal attacks by the United States against Professor Sumner's integrity are ironic given the fact that only seven months ago he was one of only two private US economists to be asked by the Chairman of the US
31 See Brazil's 2 December 2003 Oral Statement, paras. 42-55. 32 The United States points out a typo (US 22 December 2003 Comments on Brazil's Econometric Model, paras. 76) that did not affect the actual analysis undertaken by Professor Sumner (see below, Comments on Section VI). 33 For an example of the extensive evidence supporting this fact, see Brazil's Further Submission, paras. 141, 178-180. 34 See inter alia Brazil's 9 September 2003 Further Submission, Sections 3.3.4.1-3.3.4.6; Brazil's 7 October 2003 Oral Statement, Section 2; Brazil's 18 November 2003 Further Rebuttal Submission, Sections 3.1-3.4, 3.7; Brazil's 2 December 2003 Oral Statement, Section 5. 35 US 22 December 2003 Comments on Brazil's Econometric Model, para. 9. 36 US 22 December 2003 Comments on Brazil's Econometric Model, para. 9. 37 US 22 December 2003 Comments on Brazil's Econometric Model, para. 1.

Commission on the Application of Payment Limitations for Agriculture, Chief USDA Economist Keith Collins, to testify before that Commission. In evaluating the effects of additional payment limitations, the Report of the Commission relies, inter alia, on the testimony and advice provided by Professor Sumner.39
13. While the US Government has attacked Professor Sumner's professional integrity, the leaders and members of the US National Cotton Council have gone further during this long dispute. They have met with and pressured Professor Sumner to discontinue his work before the Panel.40 Moreover, NCC members have and continue to seek to cut off research and scholarship funds for the University of California at Davis, in protest of Professor's Sumner's work in this dispute.41 One NCC member representative even went so far as to be quoted as saying that "if this had been a military issue, what Dr. Sumner did would be called treason".42 Recently, the President of the NCC threatened both Professors Sumner and Babcock with unspecified action following the end of the WTO proceedings, stating "[i]n another time and venue there will be a full examination of the actions taken by these 2 economists".43 This threat was elaborated in a recent analysis in a leading Agricultural Newspaper, the Western Farm Press:
In the trade issue with Brazil, NCC President and CEO Mark Lange remains incensed at [Brazil's] WTO action. More specifically, he is angry because two US economists hired on to Brazil's payroll and prepared testimony against the United States in the WTO action. University of California economist Dan Sumner, former assistant secretary of agriculture, was hired to assist in the case. Lange added that Sumner `appears to have hired' Professor Bruce Babcock, an agricultural economist at Iowa State University and director of the Center for Agricultural and Rural Development to attempt to modify the Food and Agricultural Policy Research Institute baseline projections for use by the Brazilians. "This action was taken without the knowledge of FAPRI," said Lange of the University of Missouri-based facility. Lange said Babcock receives federal funds for the CARD programme and he pledged "a full examination of the actions of these two guys" once the WTO issue is settled. California cotton industry leaders and others have protested Sumner's actions to the dean of U.C. Davis school of agriculture and have lobbied for private research and scholarship funds to be withdrawn from the University in protest of Sumner's actions.44
14. Over the past six months, NCC members have been instrumental in coordinating efforts to attempt to force officials of the University of California at Davis to require Professor Sumner to stop

his work in this dispute.45 To their credit, these U.C. Davis officials have refused to bend to the pressure. 15. As Dr. Lange's statements quoted above indicates, the NCC now has focused on Professor Babcock for his very limited role in working with Professor Sumner in the application of parts of the FAPRI and CARD models. Professor Babcock's letter46 is addressed to leading House and Senate staff members who have "relied on FAPRI and CARD to provide objective and high quality quantitative and qualitative assessment of US farm policy alternatives". Professor Babcock's letter states he is "prepared to do whatever it takes to mend this relationship, including disassociating myself from future official FAPRI analyses if so desired". The letter provides the Panel with insights into the type of pressure imposed by the NCC on the economists providing the Panel with assistance in this dispute. 16. These efforts by the representatives of the US upland cotton producers who are heavily dependent upon US subsidies and US Congressional support for their economic survival is perhaps understandable, but nonetheless deplorable. Professor Sumner has demonstrated considerable courage and fortitude in continuing his work to assist the Panel and ultimately all WTO Members in this dispute. Brazil has no doubts that the United States is also appalled at the prospect that either of these two distinguished economists would suffer any adverse professional consequences from their assistance to the Panel and the Parties in this dispute. Given the obligation of all WTO Members to cooperate and assist the Panel in making an objective assessment of the facts of a dispute, Brazil is certain the United States will unequivocally condemn any such threats, including those now being made by the US National Cotton Council. 17. With these introductory remarks in mind, Brazil presents below Professor Sumner's response to the US 22 December 2003 Comments Concerning Brazil's Econometric Model.

II. PROFESSOR SUMNER'S COMMENTS CONCERNING THE US CRITIQUE OF HIS MODEL
Response to "Comments from the United States of America Concerning Brazil's Econometric Model" dated December 22, 2003
Daniel A. Sumner
20 January 2004
18. This response to the US critique of the modelling work on US cotton subsidies conducted by myself and my colleagues addresses each of the US comments in the order in which they appear in the US critique submitted on 22 December 2003. However, let me start with some general comments I feel are in order.
19. Much of the US critique repeats the description of my adaptations to the FAPRI model, as provided in Annex I and subsequent documents.47 The model I developed was based on the core domestic crops model of FAPRI with several additions and modifications to fit the questions before this Panel. I stated in detail where my model made those additions and modifications.48 Thus, these US comments add nothing by reasserting that my model was not identical to the FAPRI model. Since I never claimed that my model was the FAPRI model, I frankly do not understand the point of these repeated assertions that are written as though they were exposing some revelation.
20. Second, the United States at least three times asserts claims about my motivations for modelling choices. Twice in the very first paragraph the United States asserts that my modelling choices were made "in order to exaggerate" acreage and price impacts. Then in paragraph 9, the United States asserts that my modelling choices were made, "for the express purpose of achieving pre-conceived results". I am puzzled how the United States would claim to have any evidence about my motivation. But more important, these statements suggest seriously immoral and unprofessional behaviour on my part. This is a very serious charge that I do not take lightly. I submit that besides being simply wrong, such attacks have no place in these proceedings.49
21. Most of the substantive issues raised in the US critique are simply re-statements of assertions that the United States disagrees with the modelling choices made in Annex I.50 My arguments for why I modelled the policies as I did have been provided to the Panel on several previous occasions and there is no reason to repeat those arguments in this document. I will refer to those arguments as necessary in footnotes.
47 See my Closing Statement on 9 October 2003, attached as Annex II to Brazil's 9 October 2003 Closing Statement, and my statements in Exhibits Bra-313 to 315, my 2 December 2003 Statement to the Panel in Exhibit Bra-342, as well as the detailed reactions to US criticism of my model in Exhibits Bra-343-345.
48 See Annex I to Brazil's 9 September 2003 Further Submission and Exhibit Bra-313. 49 Some of the economic material presented by the United States in this case has been authored directly by Dr. Glauber. I note that the 22 December 2003 "Comments" are not attributed to anyone by name, therefore I am unable to respond directly to any individual person with respect to these personal charges. 50 However, the United States does not propose other methods for modelling the subsidy programmes in case they disagree with my model choices. They simply state that these programmes should not cause any effects ­ a position that is clearly untenable given the other economic evidence about the effects of the programs, including statements by the users and beneficiaries of the programmes.

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-448
Section II
22. Paragraphs 5 to 11 of the US critique are devoted to reasserting what I stressed in Annex I that was submitted many months ago, namely that I made adaptations to the FAPRI modelling framework. As I have explained, the FAPRI framework alone was not appropriate for the analysis of the questions before this Panel and therefore I modified and supplemented the framework. However, let us put these modifications and additions in perspective. Of the hundreds of equations used to compute the results, almost all are directly taken from the FAPRI domestic crops model. The basic behavioural supply and demand equations are taken directly from the FAPRI model as are the elasticities used to quantify those equations. In Annex I, and in subsequent documentation51, I tried to avoid taking credit for work that was not mine. At the same time, I tried to be clear about the distinctions between my work and that of FAPRI and CARD.
23. Professor Bruce Babcock from CARD ­ with whom I worked together in his private capacity ­ provided a letter to Congressional staff economists52 who are familiar with "official" FAPRI analysis of US policy questions, but who have not followed these proceeding closely. In that letter, Professor Babcock explained to them what he and I have always been clear about and had already stated to this Panel. My analysis used part of the FAPRI modelling system, but was not conducted by the full FAPRI team and was not "official" FAPRI analysis. These Congressional staff members had not had access to Annex I or other material submitted to this Panel and Professor Babcock felt a need to clarify these facts. There was no new information in the letter that he sent these staff members that was not already included in Annex I and in the subsequent material provided to the Panel.
24. For example, Professor Babcock points out that the baseline was the November 2002 preliminary FAPRI baseline not the official 2003 FAPRI baseline that became available after I undertook my analysis. He also points out that I used the CARD international cotton model rather than the FAPRI full international model in my analysis.53 This is not new to those of us who have participated in this Panel proceeding, but Professor Babcock decided to make these clarifications to the Congressional staff members.54
25. One point made in the Babcock letter ­ and emphasized in the US critique ­ is the obvious fact that if a different team of analysts with a different model had conducted the analysis the results would have been different. That is always true. Different analysts to whom the same question is posed would come up with at least a somewhat different model. Obviously a FAPRI team conducting an official "FAPRI" analysis would have developed a model that is at least somewhat different from my adaptations. In part this occurs because, with complex issues involved, the questions themselves may be interpreted slightly differently, and because, in many cases, there are a range of equally acceptable approaches to an economic modelling choice. It is much less clear how the direction of the results would have changed if different teams with different models conducted analyses. As the review of the independent literature and the independent models in this case suggests, most analyses of US cotton subsidies have found larger impacts than I found in my research.55 It is not clear whether an "official" FAPRI analysis would have found larger or smaller impacts if FAPRI would have been posed the same questions as those posed in Annex I, and if the FAPRI team analyzing these questions had considered all the evidence presented to this Panel.
51 See in particular Exhibit Bra-313. 52 Exhibit US-114. 53 I will discuss the latter issue in greater detail in my comment on Section VII. 54 The letter responds a perception of concern among some in the United States about the participation of US economists and US based models providing evidence on behalf of Brazil. In particular, Professor Babcock clarified that his FAPRI colleagues at the University of Missouri had not participated in the analysis and that this work was done in a private capacity not at a part of an "official" FAPRI project. 55 See for example the review of independent studies in Exhibit Bra-344.

Section II. A.
26. The heading of this section is oddly contradicted by its content. The heading says the "Brazil Model Not Comparable to the FAPRI System", yet the next three paragraphs proceed to compare these two models. Several incorrect assertions are included here, but these are repeated in more detail in later sections and so are dealt with below. However, one clarification is important to make both here and below. Whereas the FAPRI system does not include separate explicit provisions for crop insurance and export credit guarantee programmes, this does not imply that the FAPRI system assumes that there are zero supply impacts of these programmes. Rather, effects of these programmes are imbedded in the baseline of the FAPRI framework.
27. If the FAPRI system had been posed questions about the impacts of crop insurance or export credit guarantee programmes, the natural approach would be to proceed as described in Annex I and in subsequent submissions: to ask how a new scenario with these programmes removed would differ from the baseline that includes these programmes. This procedure was precisely what FAPRI analysts did when they analyzed payment limit rules for the Commission on Payment Limitation in analysis presented in June 2003.56 The FAPRI framework also does not contain any explicit provisions on payment limitations. These were added to the system for the analysis of the effect of payment limitations, much as I added equations on crop insurance and export credit guarantees for purposes of my Annex I analysis.
28. It is simply wrong to assert that, because a programme is not identified separately in the FAPRI framework, its effects must be assumed to be zero. Furthermore, as discussed further below, in some cases the best evidence on the impact of a programme is from the users of that programme. This was my judgment about the impacts of the export credit guarantee programmes. It certainly makes no sense whatsoever to assume that a programme has zero effect, simply because its impacts, which are known to be positive, are difficult to quantify precisely.
Section II.B.1
29. I explained in great detail the basis for my approach to PFC, DP, MLA and CCP payment programmes.57 Clearly I disagree with the assertion made in paragraph 16 and 17. There is no new content here and there is no reason to repeat my argument and evidence. I note, however, that no "official" FAPRI analysis of these payment programmes has asked the question how acreage would respond if cotton programmes were removed while the payments for the other programme crops remained in place. The FAPRI analysis is concerned with the very different question of what would be the impact for all crops if the payment programmes were removed for all crops simultaneously. Therefore, I had to make some adjustments to the treatment of these programmes, as the question that faces this Panel could not be answered by the traditional FAPRI framework. In addition, as footnote

57 Annex I, paras. 37-51; and my oral statements on 22 July (Exhibit Bra-105, paras 20-33), 2 December (Exhibit Bra-342, paras 31-37) and my closing statement on 9 October (Part 4); Exhibits Bra-280, Bra-313, and Bra-345 (paras 18-34). Some of the key arguments I made can be summarized as follows:
· none of the studies in the literature analyzes the amount of payments made in connection with a specific crop that are received by current producers of that crop,
· none of the studies in the literature focuses on the specific effects of these payments for cotton due to o the high per-acre payments for cotton reflecting higher costs of production, o the restrictions on planting fruits and vegetables affect particularly cotton production,
· direct and counter-cyclical payments give farmers an incentive to produce the crop for which they have base acreage,
· future updates of base induce farmers to plant their base acreage to the programme crop or even expand the area planted to the programme crop.

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-450
57 highlights, my judgment is that the programmes all have some commodity-specific acreage impact for cotton.
30. The table referred to in paragraphs 21 through 24 simply shows that when the planting impact of these payment programmes for cotton are assumed to have no specific impact on cotton acreage, but only a broad and diffuse effect on all programme crops, then the resulting acreage impact will indeed be nearly zero.
Section II.B.2
31. Annex I as well as subsequent submissions and oral discussions with the Panel have explained in detail my approach to the production impacts of crop insurance and why my approach, for example by leaving out risk reduction impacts, is conservative.58 The approach is straightforward. The crop insurance subsidy lowers costs to cotton growers and the acreage impact of lower costs in percentage terms may be calculated by multiplying the lower per acre costs by the elasticity of supply. The FAPRI framework has not been used to assess the production impacts of crop insurance. But the impacts of crop insurance subsidies are implicit in the FAPRI baseline.59 My approach made the impacts explicit so that I could assess the acreage effects of removing the subsidy. This is discussed in somewhat more detail below.
32. Paragraphs 25 through 30 and the table referred to there simply repeat the US claim that hundreds of millions of dollars of crop insurance subsidies for cotton producers has had zero effect on farmers' choices to grow cotton. I disagree and my model has quantified these impacts using FAPRI elasticities and other features of the FAPRI US crops model.
33. Not withstanding the "intuition" of the United States, the analysis that underlies paragraph 29 of the US critique is evidence of faulty economic reasoning. Furthermore, the US claim about how the FAPRI model treats crop insurance subsidies is misleading at best.60 As noted above, the FAPRI framework includes the value of crop insurance subsidies implicitly and has not previously been used to analyze the impact of eliminating crop insurance for cotton. Crop insurance for cotton is a service purchased by farmers on a per-acre basis in their business of producing cotton. The subsidy provided by the US government lowers the cost of this service. It is a principle of basic economics that a subsidy that lowers marginal costs results in the same impact as a direct price subsidy on output. Following this principle, I first calculate the regional cotton crop insurance subsidy rate per acre of cotton as a percentage of net revenue and then multiply those subsidy ratios times the elasticity of cotton acreage response applicable to that region. The United States is right that there are more complex ways to model the impact of crop insurance, for example, by noting that crop insurance has an additional acreage impact due to risk reduction. But, the methodology I apply is straightforward, conservative and based on intuitive economic logic and basic principles.
Section II.B.3
34. Paragraphs 31 through 34 and the table to which they refer again simply repeat the US assertion that billions of dollars of subsidized export credit guarantees for cotton exports have zero effect on US production and exports. I find this implausible on its face and based my quantification of the impact on estimates provided by representative of users of the programme. This seems to me to be a reasonable approximation. My use of that estimate was conservative relative to the National
58 See also Exhibit Bra-313. 59 While there is no specific equation modelling the effects of crop insurance, its effects are part of the baseline that projects a level of planted acreage against the background of the continuation of the crop insurance programme. 60 Paragraph 29 of the US Critique.

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-451
Cotton Councils estimates, as explained in detail in response to questions from the Panel61, and as the US acknowledges in footnote 17 to paragraph 32 of its critique. The National Cotton Council testified that the impact on export was 500,000 bales and the impact that I estimate is considerably smaller. I use my model, based significantly on FAPRI elasticities and other parameters to calculate the price, acreage and other impacts of the initial shift of 500,000 bales. This resulted in much lower net impacts on price and export quantities than estimated by the National Cotton Council.62
Section III
35. In paragraphs 35 through 38 of the US critique, the United States points out that the baseline prices reported in Annex I are not the same as baseline prices provided to the United States by Professor Babcock on November 26 as part of the model documentation.63 The United States implies that I have manipulated the baseline to generate higher effects.64 This allegation has no basis whatsoever.
36. The documentation delivered by Professor Babcock65 was the FAPRI US crops model that was calibrated with the system of FAPRI international crops models to reproduce the FAPRI November 2002 preliminary baseline projections. The Annex I analysis began with these FAPRI November 2002 preliminary baseline projections. However, the Annex I results were developed by linking the FAPRI US crops model with the CARD international cotton model that was developed by researchers at Iowa State University. Unfortunately, the description of the baseline in Annex I and subsequent submissions was imprecise by not making this distinction explicit. Instead, I labelled the baseline as an (unpublished) FAPRI November 2002 preliminary baseline rather than a slight modification thereof. This slight modification was required for internal consistency reasons, as explained below.
37. The table below provides a full comparison of the differences in the baseline reported in Annex I and the FAPRI November of 2002 preliminary baseline. As can be seen, they are different but those differences are very small overall.
38. There are two reasons for the small differences between the baseline projections used in the Annex I analysis and reported in Annex I and the November 2002 FAPRI preliminary baseline projections. The first was caused by the need to calibrate the CARD cotton model rather than the FAPRI international model with the US crops model. Consistency with the CARD international cotton model implied very small changes in the baseline. The second source of difference was that new macroeconomic projections became available in late November, 2002. These new macroeconomic projections were incorporated into the CARD international cotton model. I stress that the equations of the FAPRI US crops model were not changed in any way. Again, the slight changes between the baseline projections are solely a result of the calibration of the model, once with the FAPRI international crops models (FAPRI preliminary November 2002 baseline) and once with the CARD international cotton model (Annex I model), as well as the updated macroeconomic data used.
39. To put this baseline issue in perspective, Brazil has provided the Panel with several sets of results from similar models on several alternative baselines, including the official FAPRI 2003
61 Brazil's 27 October Answers to Questions, paras. 104-107. 62 In table 5.Ig of Annex I, I report an average export effect of 300,000 bales and an average US price effect of about 0.5 cents per pound, as opposed to the NCC estimate of 500,000 bales and 3 cents per pound. 63 See Exhibit Bra-346. 64 Paragraph 38 of the US critique. 65 Exhibit Bra-343, para. 11 and Exhibit Bra-346.

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-452
baseline.66 The bottom line is that these results are extremely robust to those alternative baselines and slight modifications to modelling specifics.
40. The same robustness applies to the results using the FAPRI November 2002 preliminary baseline and the modification applied. The United States assertion that the Annex I baseline meaningfully affects ("exaggerate[s]"67) the effects of removing US cotton subsidies is, therefore, unfounded.
41. To analyze the validity of the US assertion, we have recalibrated the CARD international cotton model (used to generate the Annex I results) to replicate exactly the FAPRI November 2002 preliminary baseline. We also used the macroeconomic projections used by FAPRI in November 2002.68 Rerunning the model of Annex I yields results that are nearly identical to those reported in Annex I. Removal of US cotton subsidies would decrease US production by an average of 24.9 per cent from 2003 to 2007.69 Mill use would decrease by 6.4 per cent.70 US exports would decrease by 41.5 per cent.71 The US Season average price would increase by 15.1 per cent.72 Importantly, the A index price would increase by 10.6 per cent. In Annex I, I reported a change in the A index price of 10.8 per cent relative to the baseline.73 This difference of less than 0.2 percentage points is simply not material.
42. In sum, it is unfortunate that this confusion occurred in the labeling of the baseline used in Annex I. The important point, however, is that it has not affected the results of my analysis. Indeed, having run the Annex I model off the non-modified version of the FAPRI November 2002 preliminary baseline projections provides one more indication of the robustness of those results.
66 This includes my Annex I model based off the FAPRI preliminary November 2002 baseline, my cotton-focussed model based off the FAPRI preliminary November 2002 baseline and the FAPRI January 2003 baseline, as well as a number of independent third party studies (Exhibit Bra-344).
67 Paragraph 38 of the US critique. 68 Both of these modifications result in an Annex I modelling system that is calibrated to exactly generate the FAPRI preliminary November 2002 baseline. It no longer contains any modifications that the United States criticizes as generating overstated resulting effects (paragraphs 36-37 of the US critique). 69 The Annex I result was 26.3 percent (paragraph 65). 70 The Annex I result was equally 6.4 percent (Table I.5a). 71 The Annex I result was 44 percent (paragraph 68). 72 The Annex I result was 15.3 percent (paragraph 69). 73 The Annex I result was 10.8 percent (paragraph 70).

Section IV
43. In section IV of the US critique, the United States claims that my model does not forecast future or explain historical outcomes of cotton plantings and that variables, such as the ratio of soybean to cotton futures prices, are more highly correlated to acreage variations in the seven years from 1996 to 2002.74 The United States claims that this has some relevance for the validity of my model and its simulation results. These claims are seriously flawed.

44. Section IV of the US critique demonstrates a complete lack of understanding of the role of policy simulation models. A policy simulation model is not designed to and does not have the capability of forecasting. Policy simulation models are designed to ask "but for" counterfactual questions not to attempt to replicate a specific history or forecast the future. Specific statistical tools

74 See inter alia paragraphs 39-42 of the US critique. This is the entire theme of section IV.

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-454
apply to forecasting economic time series ­ generally based on some variant of regression analysis ­ to forecast/predict future or explain historic outcomes of, for instance, cotton plantings. Contrary to the assertion of paragraph 39 of the US critique, no professional economist would ever propose a simulation model designed to consider the impacts of policy alternatives as the appropriate tool for forecasting the future or for explaining historical data for an industry. I certainly would never propose the use of a policy simulation model for forecasting purposes.75
45. I begin my response to the US critique in section IV by noting that ­ as I understand it ­ the questions before the Panel relate to the analysis of the effects of the US cotton subsidies, not to predict cotton plantings for future marketing years.76 The simulation model that I have presented in Annex I and in later submissions to the Panel addresses exactly that first question before the Panel. Given the baseline that covers historical data for marketing years 1999-2001 and projections for marketing years 2002-2007, my simulation model asks what would have been or what would be the effects of removing the US subsidies on US acreage, use and exports of cotton as well as on cotton prices and other variables.
46. The United States is wrong when it implicitly claims that the ability of a policy simulation model to forecast or account for variations in a time series provides any useful guide to its reliability in terms of the simulation results that it generates ­ for example in assessing what may happen if policy variables were to change.
47. Forecasting models are typically based on multivariate time series regression analysis that accounts for short-run and long-run trends, serial correlation of times series and exogenous factors. In agriculture, projecting acreage choices would likely involve projecting climate variations, pest trends, and many other variables. (Any standard econometrics textbook provides the basics for forecasting economic time series.77)
48. Neither my Annex I model nor the FAPRI policy model (nor the USDA policy models) provides an appropriate framework for statistical analysis explaining historical variations in acreage or for forecasting future acreage.78 The purpose of simulation models is to isolate the effects of, for instance, subsidy programmes as they occur against the baseline results. Policy simulation models do not claim to be useful for forecasting purposes and they are not. But this is irrelevant to their stated purpose as "but for" (counterfactual) policy analysis tools.
49. My simulation model assumes "average" trends for many variables that change in real world situations, but are set at averages in the baseline (or at historical outcomes). For example, my model assumed average weather conditions for marketing years 2002-2007. However, no doubt, there will be years with weather better than the average and years with weather worse than the average. The model cannot predict this, and, therefore, any deviations in the real world that impact on, for instance, planting decisions, would result in "projections" by the model to be necessarily wrong ­ to the extent that important outcomes of variables, such as weather, deviate from the baseline.
75 I note that the claims made by the United States about the "Sumner model" apply with equal (lack of) force to the FAPRI models themselves. No one uses these models to forecast, nor should they. The models are used and useful to ask "but for" questions, which forecasting models are not in a position to do.
76 Thus, any assertions of the United States that my model cannot predict future or explain past outcomes of cotton planting is not a relevant factual statement that helps this Panel determine the effects of the US cotton subsidies.
77 See for example, William H. Greene, Econometric Analysis Prentice Hall; 5th edition (2002) (cited in Brazil's 22 December Answers to Questions, para. 42) A classic and still useful reference is Charles R. Nelson, Applied Time Series Analysis for Managerial Forecasting, Holden Day, San Francisco. (1973).
78 Running the same correlation calculations that the United States applied to my model off the FAPRI or USDA's FAPSIM model would very likely not reveal significantly higher correlations as these simulations models are ­ like my adaptation of the FAPRI model ­ not designed for that purpose.

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-455
50. A simple illustration may clarify the point that statistical regression models and policy simulation models serve different purposes. Consider a period in which a large direct production subsidy was in force, but the parameters of the programme did not change. Given changes in climate, agronomic factors or other economic incentives, planted acreage would change over the period, but none of the changes in acreage would be due to changes in the subsidy, because there were none. The result of any time-series regression analysis of a limited number of data points is incapable of isolating the effects of variables, such as subsidy programmes, that do not change considerably during the period under analysis. Other variables would explain the variation in acreage over the period and would be better predictors of future acreage shifts so long as the large subsidy programme remained unchanged.
51. But does this mean that the large direct production subsidy is irrelevant to planted acreage? No, of course not. Does this mean that a model to consider the amount of acreage that would be planted, but for the subsidy, should assume the subsidy was irrelevant? No, of course not. Therefore, a statistical regression (or correlation) model applied to analyze the effects of such "constant variables" would fail to capture their importance. In sum, only a policy simulation model, of the general sort that I have provided in Annex I will adequately isolate the effects from the cotton subsidy programme hidden in the regression analysis.
52. Similarly, policy simulation models are not usually very good at forecasting future or explaining past events, as explained above. Does this mean that the simulation analyzed the effects of the subsidy programmes incorrect?79 No, of course not, if they are properly designed.
53. The United States further claims that there are small positive or negative correlations between the expected net revenue and planting decisions, as a result of my model.80 The table referred to in paragraphs 43 though 52 of the US critique and the discussion in those paragraphs also illustrate the misunderstanding that the United States evidently has about model evaluation and the meaning of the statistics they produce. The table at paragraph 49 reports simple correlations coefficients based on seven observations for a few variables. First, I note that the sample size for these variables is simply too small for any meaningful statistical analysis. Second, simple (univariate) correlation coefficients are not measures of explanatory power as the United States implies, for example, in paragraph 42 of its critique.81 Simple correlation coefficients tell us nothing of interest when many variables affect an outcome.82 This again highlights the difference between forecasting or explanatory models and policy simulations models that ask "but for" counterfactual questions. Nothing in this section of the US critique relates in any way to the usefulness of models for policy analysis.
54. Correlation coefficients measure linear statistical relationships between two variables in isolation from all other influences. They do not indicate causation and they do not even indicate a statistical relationship between variables that takes place in the real-world situation when there are many simultaneous statistical and causal relationships in place. It follows that the figures presented in the table at paragraph 49 are not indicative of causation or even of the contribution to statistical explanatory power in the current case where many variable are interrelated. Whether the figures are
79 The United States implies this in paragraphs 40-50 of its critique. 80 Paragraphs 43-46 and table at paragraph 49 of the US critique 81 Paragraphs 41-42 and 45-49. 82 The case of cotton plantings is a good example. Planting decisions are a function of expected revenue itself determined by expected market revenue and expected government payments. It is further a function of expected revenue for other crops, of weather conditions at planting time, of expected demand for the crop, expected weather during the growing season and so forth. Simple univariate correlation measures linear statistical relationships, not causation or even statistical relationships if there are many factors that potentially affect the outcome of a variable. This explains that there may be a negative correlation where one intuitively expects a positive correlation as a result of ignoring the effects of all other factors on the variable to be explained.

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-456
positive or negative, large or small, they have no statistical significance and provide no meaningful information.
55. In sum, the US statement at paragraph 50 of its critique has no basis whatsoever. As with all policy simulation models, including the FAPRI and USDA simulation models, any single factors or set of variables in my model are not necessarily expected to "explain" the time series data. The model was not designed to explain historic events or predict future outcomes. Instead my model is designed to simulate what would be expected to happen if US subsidies were removed. A test of the model would be to observe responses if subsidies were removed and other factors were held constant. Presenting a set of simple correlation coefficients on seven years of historical data over which subsidies remained in place provides no evidence of any relevance.
56. Finally, I refer the Panel to the many instances in which I have addressed the question of lagged prices used to model farmers' price expectations at planting time.83 I will not repeat these arguments here to respond to the US criticism that I should have used futures market prices.84 I would note that Brazil's submissions have thoroughly addressed the US arguments that US farmers planting decisions are made in accordance with futures market prices.85
Section V
57. This section of the US critique repeats again that my model differs from the FAPRI US crops model. It also asserts that the United States had difficulties in replicating results of my analysis from the electronic files. This section also reveals that the United States made several mistaken "assumptions" about how certain variables entered the model. As indicated before, given the complexities of working with these models, both Professor Babcock and I have repeatedly offered to work with the United States to replicate my results.86 US government or other economists working on the US critique of my model could have contacted either Professor Babcock or myself requesting any needed information or assistance with any problems they have had. If they would have done so, we could have clarified any ambiguities and the United States could have avoided the evident errors made in applying my model. However, they did not contact either of us. As a result they made inappropriate assumptions and have failed to apply the model correctly.
58. Let me begin by addressing the US statements about the differences between the Annex I model and the FAPRI model.87 The essence of those differences was explained in Annex I while the operational details were specified more precisely in Exhibit Bra-313. Annex I attempted to provide a relatively simple heuristic discussion of the modelling approach. Exhibit Bra-313 provided the operational equations. These operational specification are made explicit in equations (4), (5) and (6) in Exhibit Bra-313. As explained in Exhibit Bra-313, my approach to the PFC, MLA, DP and CCP payment programmes and for crop insurance was to use a constant regional acreage elasticity (taken from the FAPRI crops model publications).88 These elasticities were the averages of the time-varying elasticities used over previous periods, as reported by the FAPRI US crops model that I adapted. I
83 See my 9 October Closing Statement attached as Annex II to Brazil's 9 October Closing Statement, my 2 December Oral Statement (Exhibit Bra-342, paras. 24-28), Exhibit Bra-345 (paras.6-14) as well as Brazil's answers to question 213 from the Panel on which I have provided input (Brazil's 22 December Answers to Questions, paras. 37-42).
84 See paragraphs 51-52 of the US critique. 85 Brazil's 2 December Oral Statement, Section 5.2 and the accompanying exhibits, as well as my oral explanations on 3 December, including Exhibit Bra-371. 86 See my oral statement on 2 December (Exhibit Bra-342, para. 5 and 8), Exhibit Bra-331 (para. 10), letter of Professor Bruce Babcock attached to Brazil's 5 November letter to the Panel 87 See section V 88 The regional supply elasticities used for the constant elasticity calculations to determine the PFC, DP, MLA and CCP effects and the crop insurance effects are as follows: Corn Belt, 0.219; Central Plains, 0.942; Delta, 0.544; Far West, 0.041; South East, 0.615; and Southern Plains, 0.362.

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-457
then apply this constant elasticity to the percentage effects of the subsidy on net revenue. This constant elasticity modelling is well established in the literature.89 Paragraphs 53-56 of the US critique misstate the operational model I used and ignore the information in Exhibit Bra-313 that explains how the heuristic explanation in Annex I was operationalized.
Sections V.A to V.C
59. In sections V.A and V.B, the Unites States fails to acknowledge that, because the level of net returns vary from year to year, the constant elasticity specification explained in Exhibit Bra-313 means that the impacts of the PFC, MLA, DP, CCP and crop insurance programmes will vary as well. When one recognizes this commonly applied feature of my specification, there is no inconsistency whatsoever between the acreage impacts in the periods 1999 through 2002 and 2003 through 2007.
60. In fact, the United States acknowledges its understanding of the operational specifications explained in Exhibit Bra-313 in paragraphs 63 through 66 of section V.C. And they acknowledge that with constant percentage effect, the number of acres shifted will depend on the percentage impacts of the subsidies on net revenue, not the absolute dollar impacts. The US observations about the programme effects in section V.A (paragraphs 57-60), section V.B (paragraphs 61-62) and in the table that follows paragraph 62 of the US critique are explained by my explicit description of the operational specifications of the Annex I model in equations (4) through (6) in Exhibit Bra-313. It is therefore puzzling why the United States included Section V.A and V.B in the document at all, since they provide no new information. The United States first simply mischaracterizes my approach as linear, and then states that the results are not in line with that linear characterization. As I explained in Exhibit Bra-313 (equations (4) through (6)) and as repeated by the United States in section V.C, my model uses a constant elasticity, constant percentage effect for these impacts.90
61. Let me clarify this a little further. The FAPRI US crops model applies a constant linear response to any added revenue. My Annex I model takes the same approach for all variables that are included from the standard FAPRI US crops model. This refers to all variables for which no modifications are reported in Exhibit Bra-313. The FAPRI linear system means that a $100 increase in subsidy has the same effect on acreage whether the base revenue is $200 or $1,000. My alternative approach is used for PFC, MLA, DP and CCP payments as well as crop insurance. It implies that a subsidy that is a constant 10 percent of net revenue has a constant percentage effect on acreage. Hence, a $100 increase in subsidy has a bigger percentage effect on acreage if base revenue were $200 (a 50 per cent increase) than if base revenue were $1,000 (a 10 per cent increase). Constant percentage impacts and constant elasticity models are far more common in the economics literature than are strictly linear models. Constant percentage effects do not imply larger impacts in general. In effect, a constant percentage effect says that subsidies have a bigger acreage effect when they are a bigger share of net revenue than when they are a smaller share of net revenue.
62. Section V.B on crop insurance contains some additional US mistakes in applying my model. The United States seems to apply a constant per-acre crop insurance benefit for all regions. This is inconsistent with my approach and with reality. As explained in paragraphs 54 and 55 of Annex I, crop insurance subsidy rates differ substantially by region and my model incorporates those differences. When the constant percentage effects are incorporated and when one applies the different regional subsidy rates, there is absolutely no inconsistency between the results in the period from 1999 through 2002 and the period 2003 through 2007.91
89 See Sumner, Daniel A., and Michael Wohlgenant, "Effects of an Increase in the Federal Excise Tax on Cigarettes," American Journal of Agricultural Economics, 1985, vol. 67, 235-242.
90 I note that contrary to the US assertion in paragraph 66, my methodology has not changed between Annex I and Exhibit Bra-313.
91 The United States claims in paragraph 62 that the existence of crop insurance had a negative impact in the acreage in the Corn Belt and that this would be an implausible result (paragraph 62 of the US Critique and

Section V.D.
63. The point of paragraphs 67 and 68 and the table to which they refer, which follows paragraph 70 ("Example of Southern Plains Acreage Impact"), are not at all clear. Most importantly, the United States is simply incorrect that I used only market revenue plus marketing loan gains as the basis for the percentage calculation.92 The full net revenue including all programme payments are included in the model specification. It is not clear why the United States made this mistaken assumption.
64. In addition, the labelling of the table itself is not clear. For example, neither Annex I nor my other submissions include regional acreage effects of subsidy programmes. This is because the focus of this case is on national and international impacts. It appears that it was the United States which calculated the figures reported in the table following paragraph 70 ("Example of Southern Plains Acreage Impact"). I note that the marketing year 2005 planting effect of crop insurance in the Southern Plains that the United States labels "Sumner Impact" exceeds the effect I report in Annex I for the entire United States.93 This reason for this seems to be that the United States presents first round effects, i.e., effects before any feedback effects (second-round effects) from both the US crops model itself as well as before any feedback from the CARD international cotton model. To be clear, these US figures are not the equilibrium figures that I reported in Annex I. They are also not the firstround effects that were intermediate for the results reported in Annex I because of mistaken US assumptions, as discussed below.
65. Further, the column (2) of the US table at paragraph 70 ("Example of Southern Plains Acreage Impact") is labelled "Programme Revenue," yet includes crop insurance. I assume this refers to the total subsidy per acre, not programme revenue. Also, the "programme revenue" only includes revenue from DP and CCP payments as well as crop insurance. No revenue from the marketing loan programme (10.06 cents per pound in MY 2005 pursuant to an AWP of 41.94 cents per pound reported in the baseline)94 is included in the calculations. By not including marketing loan payments in its calculations, the United States does not follow its own proposition of what the right approach is.95 Rather, it has excluded marketing loan revenue entirely from its calculations in the table at paragraph 70 of its critique ("Example of Southern Plains Acreage Impact"), leading to distorted elasticity calculations.
66. There are a number of further problems in the examples the United States provides in the tables at paragraph 70 of the US critique ("Example of Southern Plains Acreage Impact") that seem to account for the differences they have created by misapplying my model. Let us use the crop insurance calculations as an example. I calculate that the Southern Plains crop insurance subsidy is $26.14 per acre, not $24.67 per acre96, as the United States enters into its table in the "programme revenue" column. Furthermore the acreage elasticity that I use is not 0.28, but rather 0.362. These
the accompanying table). This is, however, not true. Net crop insurance subsidies in the Corn Belt were negative over time, with indemnity payments being below premium payments. Therefore, the program provided farmers with a net negative return causing negative acreage impacts. This is an entirely plausible result. See below the discussion on the amount of crop insurance subsidy payments (at paragraph 66, note 96 below). I also note that cotton is not an important crop in the Corn Belt and that crop insurance benefits in the more important regions in the Southern Plains and in the Southeast are much higher.
92 See paragraph 68 of the US Critique. 93 Compare the 0.446 million acres reported by the United States without offering any source with the results I have reported in Annex I, Table I.5d, which is 0.420 million acres. 94 See Annex I, Table I.5a. 95 See paragraph 68 of the US Critique. 96 The regional crop insurance subsidy rates that I use are as follows: Corn Belt: -$0.70; Central Plains: $28.24; Delta: $7.37; Far West: $13.62; Southeast: 15.71; Southern Plains: 26.14.

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-459
two further obvious errors in the US application of my model account for the bulk of the differences that the United States seems to imply (incorrectly) were errors on my part.
67. Besides this, the table following paragraph 70 of the US critique ("Example of Southern Plains Acreage Impact") not only contain numbers that are not my reported impacts, they also make the serious conceptual error of simply adding the impact of each programme across the columns to get a "total" effect. This is an error because the effects of the programmes are not independent. In order to estimate the impacts of removing these three sets of programmes together, one must simulate that scenario explicitly. The resulting impacts will be smaller than the sum of the impacts of removing each programme one at a time. For example, if one removed the crop insurance programme for cotton, supply would fall and the market price of cotton in the United States would rise. This would imply that the CCP programme would have a smaller subsidy element and its effect would be smaller. The fact that the United States reported the simple sum of impacts across programmes and represented that as the impact due to the three sets of programmes together seems to demonstrate either an inadvertent error or a basic lack of understanding of how the programme and the model operates.
Section V.E
68. There are several problems and inconsistencies in the discussion and tables included in this section. These problems also apply to the calculations in section V.D.97 The United States improperly applied my model and, therefore, it is not surprising that they found different results. I note that the United States in paragraphs 71 of its critique states that "reasonable assumptions were made to facilitate the calculations". I repeat again that Professor Babcock and myself offered the United States our assistance in replicating the results. Any request for assistance would have avoided these problems and the need for the United States to make "reasonable assumptions ... to facilitate the calculations".
69. One important problem that vitiates any claims in this section is that the numbers that are labeled "Sumner's Reported Impacts" in the three charts that follow paragraph 72 are not what I reported in Annex I Tables I.5.b, I.5.c and I.5.d.98 The United States compares two sets of numbers that were evidently generated by the United States, neither of which is the result that I actually reported to this Panel.
70. As noted above, it seems that the United States provides direct acreage effects (so-called firstround effects) that do not take into account feedback effects from either the US crops model or the CARD international cotton model. These feedback adjustments are very large and the US figures do not represent the new, much smaller, equilibrium effects.
71. With this in mind, I will address the US arguments in section V.E. The United States claims that my approach to estimating the acreage impacts of removing PFC/DP, CCP/MLA, and crop insurance subsidies is deeply flawed because their attempted replication of the my methodology showed sharply lower impacts in 2002 ­ 2007 than what they claim were my estimated impacts.99 As I will demonstrate, the difference between the two sets of estimates of the United States is primarily due to differences in the magnitude of elasticities of supply the United States used, as compared to the elasticities that I actually used. The United States applied time-varying, linear elasticities100 because this is what is suggested by the FAPRI linear modelling framework. My Annex I results of the effects
97 I have combined the discussion of these points to avoid any repetition in an already lengthy and technical document.
98 Nor are these the figures that I have reported using the FAPRI January 2003 baseline (Exhibit Bra325)
99 Paragraph 69 of the US Critique and second set of tables following paragraph 70 of the US Critique, as well as the three charts following paragraph 72 of the US Critique.
100 I have explained that in my comments on section V.A-V.C.

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-460
of these listed programmes are, however, based on a constant elasticity structure. As I will show, the US implementation of the United States' method using time-varying, linear elasticities is deeply flawed and leads to a dramatic underestimation of the effects. To clarify this step by step, I take as a starting point the US implementation of my Annex I methodology.101
72. The United States calculates time-varying, linear elasticities by multiplying the slope coefficient in the FAPRI US crops model by real net revenue (net revenue divided by a GNP deflator) and dividing the result by base acreage.102 Net revenue used in this calculation is expected market revenue plus marketing loan gains. Contrary to the US approach and as discussed above, I use a set of elasticities that does not vary with time. The first chart below shows how the different elasticity estimates change the estimated acreage effects of removing PFC/DP, CCP/MLA, and crop insurance subsidies.103

73. I note again that these acreage effects are "first-round" effects that represent an intermediate calculation step towards estimating the new equilibrium results. Therefore, these figures are conceptually different from the equilibrium acreage effects reported in Annex I.104
74. These effects are also not the same as the first-round acreage effects that I have estimated using the Annex I model because of differing subsidy levels, as explained below.
101 All calculations are presented in Exhibit Bra-399 (`AcreageDiscrepancies.xls') attached to the electronic version of this document.
102 Base acres are the acreage planted under the baseline scenario. 103 The chart presents total effects from all three subsidy programs (PFC/DP, MLA/CCP and crop insurance) and controls for interaction effects. 104 The Annex I effects take into account second round effects on price and quantities resulting from the first round effects and also the feedback from the CARD international cotton model leading to an equilibrium effect.

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-461

75. I note that the effects reported in chart 1 are quite similar to the pattern of effects presented by the United States, as reported in the charts following paragraph 72 of the US critique.105 I have included the aggregate effects from these three programmes, controlling for interaction effects between them, which accounts for the differences between my figures and the sum of the figures presented by the United States.
76. I also note that, in chart 2, the pattern of acreage effects estimated by my use of a constant elasticity model specification106 is consistent with the pattern of the importance of these subsidies, i.e., the share of the total net revenue presented by these subsidies.

77. The results in chart 1 would suggest that most of the discrepancy between the first-round effects that lead to my Annex I results and those first-round effects calculated by the United States is due to different assumptions regarding elasticities.
78. However, it is not true that the difference in the assumptions regarding the elasticities does primarily account for the difference. First, there is much less difference between the results from the two assumptions regarding the elasticities once an error in the United States' method for calculating its time-varying, linear elasticities is corrected.107 As documented in the Final USCROPS2003.xls file108, the United States calculates the supply elasticity by multiplying the slope parameter by real net revenue and then dividing it by base acreage. Net revenue in this calculation includes marketing loan
105 They are not identical, as the United States used the FAPRI January 2003 baseline provided with my cotton-focused model for these calculations. The similarity of the figures demonstrates again the robustness of the model if different baselines are used.
106 I have discussed this feature of a constant elasticity model in my comments on section V.A-V.C above.
107 As discussed below, the United States also uses compares results from two different baselines. 108 Exhibit US-115.

gains and expected market revenue, but it does not include crop insurance subsidies and the other government subsidies that are to be removed in this simulation.109 As the United States correctly points out when they question whether I included these subsidies for the calculation of the percentage change in net revenue from subsidy removal110, these subsidies should also be counted towards net revenue when calculating the elasticity of supply.111 The mistaken assumption by the United States that I have not done so seems to have let the United States to also leave these revenue components out of their calculation, thereby generating misleading results.
79. The following chart 3 shows that when the time-varying, linear elasticities are correctly calculated, then the choice of time-varying, linear elasticities or constant elasticities makes much less difference to the estimated impacts of subsidy removal than suggested by the United States in the three charts following paragraph 72 of the US critique.

80. Finally, one last source of difference is that the United States uses the model calibrated to the FAPRI 2003 baseline112 rather than the baseline used to estimate the effects reported in Annex I. The next chart (4) compares the actual direct acreage effects (first round effects) from removal of PFC/DP, CCP/MLA, and crop insurance subsidies based off the baseline used to generate the Annex I results to those that would have resulted from using the correct US time-varying, linear elasticity approach, the correct net revenue estimates and the same baseline. As shown below, adopting the corrected United States procedure compared to my constant elasticities approach would have resulted in a dramatic increase in the estimated impacts of removing these subsidies in 1999, somewhat higher estimates in 2000 and 2001, and a bit lower estimates in 2003 to 2007.
109 I note that I also made this point in my comments on section V.D above. 110 See paragraph 68 of the US Critique. 111 I note that I correctly included these subsidies. 112 Provided by Brazil as an attachment to its 18 November 2003 Further Rebuttal Submission.

81. In sum, the bottom line of these calculations is that, if the United States had followed the approach that they and I agree would be correct for calculating total net revenue and resulting timevarying, linear elasticities, the resulting effects would not be significantly different whether simulated using constant elasticities or time-varying, linear elasticities. I used the constant elasticity method because it makes the common sense assumption that equal percentage changes in net revenue should give rise to similar changes in acreage.113 As noted above, this is also a standard approach in economic literature.
82. Finally, I would like to stress that any remaining differences from using different elasticity approaches are still on the level of "first round" effects, not equilibrium effects. The resulting equilibrium effects would show results that are even less different based on the choice of timevarying, linear versus constant elasticities. In short, this choice does not meaningfully affect my Annex I results.
Section VI.
83. In paragraphs 73-74 of the US critique, the United States calls into questions my modelling approach for the marketing loan programme by describing it as revealing a "lack of knowledge of the programme, a broader deficiency in economics or some previously unknown modification of the FAPRI or CARD models". These allegations are baseless. Indeed, the United States simply identified a typo in the transcription of equation 2 in Exhibit Bra-313. This transcription typo was not made in the electronic model and, therefore, does not affect the results of my Annex I model. In the Annex I model, as in the FAPRI US crops model, the acreage in year `t' is affected by the loan rate in year `t' (not the loan rate in `t-1' as erroneously reported in Exhibit Bra-313). I regret the inconvenience if this typo caused some confusion.
113 I have discussed this above providing the example of a $100 payments and base revenues of $200 and $1000.

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-464
84. It turns out that, contrary to what the United States implies in paragraph 74 of its critique, this typo introduced no ambiguity at all and would not have affected the results in any significant way. The fact is that the loan rate for cotton is essentially constant over the full period of analysis and, thus, the loan rate in period `t' is equal to the loan rate in period `t-1'.114 Despite the tone of the paragraph, the model was clear, and the subscript `t' or `t-1' make no difference at all in this case. Yet, I stress again that this typo only occurred in the transcript of equation (2) in Exhibit Bra-313, and not in the electronic versions of the Annex I model itself.
85. In paragraph 74 the United States makes a major issue of what amounts to their own semantic confusion. The model that I use for the marketing loan benefits for cotton is as specified in equation (2) (noting the typo discussed above). As noted by the United States, the electronic versions of the models show that the marketing loan effect is based on the difference between the loan rate and what is labeled as the loan repayment rate. For crops other than rice and cotton the loan repayment rate is the US market price of the crop (a local market price). For cotton and rice the loan repayment rate is an international price and, for cotton specifically, it is the adjusted world price (AWP). Thus, there is no discrepancy between Exhibit Bra-313 and the electronic documentation provided. The formulation that I use for the marketing loan impacts is the same as the FAPRI US crops model.
86. Paragraph 75 of the US critique simply repeats their discussion from the section V.C., which I have addressed above.
87. Finally, in paragraph 76 of its critique, the United States alleges that I have taken an "illogical" approach on specifying the export effect of Step 2 payments that constitutes "a departure from the specifications in the FAPRI framework." Similar to my response to the US critique at paragraph 73, I regret that I made another typo in the subscript in Exhibit Bra-313 that was not included in the electronic version of the model and, therefore, does not affect my results. Of course exports in period `t' market the crop produced in that period. The US marketing years are calibrated so that this is generally true. The United States is correct that, with the typo, equation (7) obviously makes no sense. The subscript should have referred to production in period `t' rather than `t-1', which, of course, is the equation contained in my model as well as in the FAPRI US crops model. Despite the US tone in paragraph 76, I expect the United States is aware that the specification of equations (7) and (8) follow the FAPRI model, as provided in the electronic verification of both the FAPRI US crops model as well as my cotton-focused model. Removal of the export step-2 and domestic step-2 subsidies increase effective demand for US cotton by lowering the effective net price paid by buyers.
Section VII
88. In paragraphs 77 through 80 of the US critique, the United States notes that the CARD international cotton model used different supply and demand elasticities than found in a paper by FAPRI-Missouri economist Seth D. Meyer. In fact there are several sets of such elasticities in the literature.
89. I relied on the CARD model and the CARD elasticities for four simple reasons. First, the authors of the published studies that underlie the CARD international cotton model include Professors Babcock and Beghin, who are two of the most widely-published and respected agricultural economists in the field. The scholarly credibility of their work and that of their CARD colleagues has been reinforced by scores of professionally-refereed academic articles to their credit as well as awards and other accolades.115 In terms of quality objective research in agricultural commodity market economics and related areas, the CARD team has a long distinguished track record and a top notch
114 I note that the loan rate was 51.92 cents per pound in marketing years 1999-2001 and 52 cents per pound in all later marketing years, so there is a tiny difference between 2001 and 2002.
115 Exhibit Bra-400 (List of Publications of Professors Babcock and Beghin).

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-465
professional reputation. By contrast, I do not know the professional work of Seth D. Meyer, and have not been able to locate any of his work in professionally-refereed publications.
90. Second, the CARD international cotton model was the model that had been used by CARD in its respected work on other international commodity analysis. I would note that the various CARD international commodity models developed by Professors Babcock and Beghin and their colleagues have been used and relied upon in a number of different studies and been published in professionally referred publications.116
91. Third, the elasticity parameters incorporated in the CARD model are well within the range of estimates found and applied for many agricultural commodities. Finally, the United States provides no evidence to support a suggestion that the Meyer estimates are in any way more appropriate for the questions posed by this Panel than the estimates imbedded in the CARD model. Therefore, United States assertion that use of the CARD model somehow "exaggerates" impacts is simply unfounded.117
Conclusion
92. The Annex I model adapted from the FAPRI US crops model and the CARD international cotton model is an appropriate tool for both forward- and backward-looking "but for" counterfactual US agricultural policy analysis questions, such as those facing this Panel. The conservative results from my Annex I model are well within any plausible range and supported by other economic and econometric evidence.
93. Over the past months of this lengthy proceeding, I have responded to each criticism raised by the United States at various occasions118 and have explained why none affects the validity of my model or its results.
94. Professor Babcock and I have been fully transparent about the manner in which the effects of the US subsidies have been simulated and I have rebutted any US allegations that I made my modelling choices to achieve pre-conceived results. To that end, I have explained each of my

117 It is also useful to remind ourselves that larger elasticies may mean smaller price impact, but also imply larger impacts on quantities and in particular larger acreage elasticities mean more acreage in the nonsubsidized countries that is driven out of cotton by the US cotton subsidy programmes.

modelling steps and offered my assistance to the Panel and the United States to facilitate the understanding of this complicated econometric model and its results.
95. The United States has criticized my choice of baseline and I have provided analysis under various other baselines, demonstrating the robustness of my results. The United States has also criticized my modelling choices for PFC, MLA, DP and CCP payments, crop insurance and export credit guarantees. I have provided evidence that these choices were reasonable and, in fact, conservative. Concerning the largest US subsidy, the marketing loan programme, I note that the United States has not criticized its modelling. I have explained that the use of lagged prices for a large-scale policy simulation analysis is standard and does not generate biased or exaggerated results ­ in fact, no futures prices could or have been used in such models.
96. In sum, I stand by my conclusions in Annex I "that very large subsidies provided to US producers and users of upland cotton have had and will continue to have large impacts on quantities of US cotton produced, used and traded and on both US and world prices of cotton".

Questions from the Panel to the parties ­ second substantive Panel meeting
I. TERMS OF REFERENCE
192. Regarding the interest subsidies and storage payments listed by the United States in its response to the Panel's Question No. 67:
(a) Please provide a copy of the regulations under which they are currently provided and under which they were provided during the marketing years 1996-2002;
(b) Please indicate whether there are any such payments which are not provided to implement the repayment rate for upland cotton within the marketing loan programme. USA
Brazil's Comment:
1. The United States finally confirms that the "other payments" (i.e., interest and storage payments) are not separate subsidies but rather a component of the marketing loan programme.1 The US acknowledgement eliminates any question whether such payments are within the Panel's terms of reference.2 Brazil's request for the establishment of a panel clearly includes "subsidies and domestic support ... relating to marketing loans ... providing direct or indirect support to the US upland cotton industry".3 Based on the US answer, Brazil amends the table at paragraph 8 of its 22 December 2003 Answers to Question 196 to add $65 million "other payments" to the $832.8 million for marketing loans, for a grand total of $887.8 million in marketing loans for MY 2002. Brazil also makes similar changes for MY 1999-2001 that combine "other payments" and marketing loan payments in Table 1 of Brazil's 9 September 2003 Further Rebuttal Submission.
193. Are interest subsidies and storage payments already included in the amounts shown in your submissions to date for payments under the marketing loan programme? Has there been any double-counting? BRA
194. Does the United States maintain its position stated in response to the Panel's Question No. 67 that "it would not be appropriate for the Panel to examine payments made after the date of panel establishment"? If so, please explain why. Can Brazil comment on this statement? BRA, USA
Brazil's Comment:
2. Brazil's 22 December 2003 response to this question, particularly its reference to the request for the establishment of the panel and existing jurisprudence, provides a comprehensive response to the points raised by the United States.4 Brazil would offer the following additional comments to the US Answer.
3. Contrary to the suggestion at paragraphs 3-4 of the US 22 December 2003 response, Brazil's 11 August 2003 response to Question 19 did not change in any way the scope of Brazil's request for the establishment of a panel ("Panel Request"). Question 19 asked Brazil to clarify the measures in respect of which Brazil sought relief. Brazil's answer referred to one set of measures relating to

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-473
Brazil's serious prejudice claims as those involving domestic support and export subsidy payments that had been made and were required to be made by the terms of the various statutory instruments identified in the Panel Request from MY 1999 through MY 2007. Some of these payments are relevant to Brazil's present serious prejudice claims for the period MY 1999-2002, and some of the payments are relevant to Brazil's threat of serious prejudice claims for the period MY 2002-2007. But as Brazil indicated in its 22 December 2003 Answer to Question 195, the text of the Panel Request (as well as Brazil's 11 August 2003 Answer to Question 19) in no way limits the type or scope of the payments made under those statutory and regulatory instruments up to 18 March 2003.
4. It is curious that the United States in its 22 December 2003 response takes an opposite position in this dispute than the one it took as the complaining party in the only other WTO serious prejudice dispute.5 In Indonesia ­ Automobiles,,6 the measures at issue provided for past, present, and future subsidy payments. Indonesia argued, similar to the US arguments here, that the effects of expired measures could no longer be examined for the purposes of current serious prejudice under Articles 5 and 6 of the SCM Agreement. Rejecting such a restrictive interpretation of Articles 5 and 6, the panel noted that:
If we were to consider that past subsidies were not relevant to our serious prejudice analysis as they were "expired measures" while future measures could not yet have caused actual serious prejudice, it is hard to imagine any situation where a panel would be able to determine the existence of actual serious prejudice. Thus, we decline to proceed on the course suggested by Indonesia.7
At no time did the panel find, as Indonesia argued, that only non-expired subsidies paid under the measures at issue up until the date of establishment of the panel should have been considered for the purposes of assessing serious prejudice. Indeed, the US position in this dispute is practically the same as what Indonesia argued ­ and the US argued against8 ­ in Indonesia ­ Automobiles. Brazil recalls the consistent US positions that (a) so-called "recurring" subsidies for MY 1999-2001 cannot be the basis for any serious prejudice claims9, combined with (b) its claim that only current 2002 subsidies up to 18 March 2003 (i.e., eight months of subsidies for MY 2002) can be the basis for any serious prejudice claims.10 Given these two arguments, in the words of the Indonesia ­ Automobiles panel, "it is hard to imagine any situation where a panel would be able to determine the existence of actual serious prejudice".
5. As in Indonesia ­ Automobiles, the legal statutes and regulations set out in the Panel Request that mandate the payment of subsidies did not change between 18 March 2003 and 20 January 2004. Indeed, the 2002 FSRI Act and its implementing regulations will remain identical (unless amended by the US Congress) until the end of MY 2007. Nor has the 2000 ARP changed since 18 March 2003. The mandated subsidies from these statutes and regulations were flowing before 18 March 2003 and they will continue to flow thereafter. This case does not present the situation where a new legal instrument providing subsidies is enacted after the panel request was established. Nor is it even a situation as in Chile ­ Agricultural Products (Price Band,11, in which a significant amendment to the legal instrument covered in the panel request was made long after the panel was established. The rationale of the Appellate Body in Chile ­ Agricultural Products (Price Band) and of the panel in Indonesia ­ Automobiles is to allow the Panel to conduct the required objective assessment under

DSU Article 11 based on all the relevant facts. These decisions are also grounded in the need for the "prompt settlement" of disputes under DSU Article 3.4 ­ and are structures to avoid the endless filing of precision-timed annual disputes and the litigation gaming strategy envisioned by the US argument.
II. ECONOMIC DATA
195. Does the United States wish to revise its response to the Panel's Question No. 67bis, in particular, its statement that "the United States ... does not maintain information on the amount of expenditures made under the cited programmes to US upland cotton producers"? Did the United States make enquiries of the FSA in the course of preparing its original answer? USA
Brazil's Comment:
6. Brazil notes that the US answer is largely unresponsive to the Panel's question.
7. The Panel's question whether the United States "maintains information" is straight-forward. A correct answer would have been "yes". The ordinary meaning of the word "maintain" is "practice habitually", "observe", "cause to continue (a state of affairs, a condition, an activity)".12 The United States consistently misled Brazil and the Panel by stating that USDA never collected, organized and maintained information regarding the amount of contract payments paid to current producers of upland cotton.13 There is no doubt that these statements were false and misleading. It is significant that the United States has made no attempt to refute the evidence produced by Brazil in its 18 November 2003 Further Rebuttal Submission regarding the FSA forms completed by practically every US farm receiving contract or marketing loan payments.14 Nor can the United States dispute that all of the information collected from the contract and acreage forms is (and was) maintained in a centralized database in USDA's Kansas City facility. The rapid response of USDA's Kansas City office to the rice FOIA request provides compelling evidence of the habitual practice of the US government in "maintaining" both contract and planted acreage information.15 Indeed, the strongest proof of the United States' misleading conduct is the fact that USDA produced within three weeks the rice data in response to a FOIA request, and that the United States effectively admitted in its 18 and 19 December 2003 and 20 January 2004 Letters to the Panel that it maintains this information.
8. In fact, the United States continues to mislead the Panel in its 22 December 2003 Answer to Question 195. It states that "because those payments are decoupled from current production, expenditures under such programmes are not tracked by whether the recipient produces upland cotton".16 Neither Brazil nor the Panel ever asked the United States how the programmes are "tracked". Rather, the Panel asked whether the United States "maintains information" that would permit the calculation of the amount of such payments. As Brazil has demonstrated in using the rice FOIA request17, in discussing its proposed methodology, and in using the incomplete summary data provided by the United States on 18/19 December 2003, this is a simple exercise.18

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-475
9. The United States also asserts that "Brazil has also not asserted that the United States maintains information on the receipt of decoupled payments for upland cotton base acres by upland cotton producers".19 Once again, the United States misleads and misrepresents. What Brazil asserted was that the United States maintains information in a centralized database on the amount of contract acreage, contract yields, and upland cotton plantings on contract acreage that would permit the ready calculation of the exact amount of contract payments received by current producers of upland cotton.20 The fact that the United States claims not to have performed the simple calculation from this data does not mean the United States does not maintain the information requested by Brazil and the Panel.
196. Please provide the latest data for the 2002 marketing year on payments under the marketing loan, direct payments, counter-cyclical payments, user marketing certificate (step 2) programmes and export credit guarantee programmes. BRA, USA
Brazil's Comment:
10. Brazil notes the new and increased figures ($415 million) that the US 22 December response presented for Step 2 payments during MY 2002. This figure should replace Brazil's figure presented at paragraph 8 of its 22 December 2003 Answers to Questions.21
197. Please provide actual data for 2002/2003 for US exports, US consumption and per cent of world consumption to replace the projected data in Exhibit US-47. If available, please provide projected data for 2003/2004 to replace the forecast data. USA
Brazil's Comment:
11. The US 22 December 2003 response admits at note 24 to the table at paragraph 15 that the US "consumption" standard for "world market share", within the meaning of Article 6.3(d) of the SCM Agreement, includes tabulating US exports and US imports and US domestic consumption of US origin upland cotton.22 This acknowledgement that imports are also included highlights the fact that the United States is double counting exports as part of the world market share of the exporting country and part of the world market share of the importing country.23 Since internationally-traded upland cotton is not similarly included twice in the total "world consumption," summing up the individual world market shares of all countries generates a total world market share vastly exceeding 100 per cent ­ a manifestly absurd result.24 As Brazil has stated before, the Panel should not rely on the US interpretation of world market share as share of world consumption ­ the proper interpretation of the term refers to the share of world exports.25
12. Further, Brazil notes the new information presented by the United States concerning US upland cotton exports in MY 2002 and 2003. These figures (11.9 million bales and 13.2 million bales respectively) would replace Brazil's latest information, as contained in Exhibit Bra-302 (11.3 million bales and 11.2 million bales respectively). These new facts support Brazil's threat of serious prejudice claim under Article 6.3(d) and footnote 13 of the SCM Agreement. For both marketing

years, the US world market share, i.e., the US share of world exports, is or will be even above its previous three-year average, strengthening the consistent trend of increasing world market shares since MY 1996 (as well as since MY 1986).26
198. Please comment on the respective merits of the price-gap calculations of MY1992 deficiency payments in US comments of 27 August, footnote 14 ($867 million), and Brazil's response to the Panel's Question No. 67 ($812 million). BRA, USA
Brazil's Comment:
13. As indicated in Brazil's 22 Decembers Answers to Questions, Brazil agrees with the US methodology of calculating MY 1992 deficiency payments27 for purposes of an AMS approach, as developed by the United States in its 27 August 2003 Comments on Brazil's 22 August 2003 Rebuttal Submission.28
14. However, Brazil strongly disagrees with the US proposition that the US AMS calculation of deficiency payments is "conservative".29 The US calculation is the only appropriate one under paragraphs 10 and 11 of Annex 3 of the Agreement on Agriculture. The United States suggests that it should have used "eligible" acreage rather than "actual" acreage for the calculation.30 However, paragraph 10 of Annex 3 does not refer to eligible acreage; it refers to "the quantity of production eligible to receive the applied administered price".31 Production eligible to receive the applied administered price under the deficiency payment programme is calculated based on the eligible, participating acreage and the applicable programme yield (not the actual yield). Any production exceeding the programme yields and any production on acreage that did not participate in the deficiency payment programme necessarily was not eligible production. Thus, the fact that theoretically more acreage could have participated in the upland cotton deficiency payment programme (i.e., those farms opted to not participate) cannot artificially inflate the upland cotton AMS figure resulting from this programme. Thus, any production that takes place on a farm not participating in the deficiency payment programme is not, in fact, eligible to receive the applied administered price and, therefore, cannot be part of the AMS calculation under paragraphs 10 and 11 of Annex 3.
199. What is the composition of the A-Index? We do note footnote 19 and, for example, Exhibit BRA-11, but please explain more in detail how this index is calculated. BRA
200. Concerning the chart on page 37 of Brazil's further rebuttal submission, why did Brazil use a futures price at planting time? Is this a relevant measure for assessing acreage response? BRA
201. Is data available to show the proportion of US upland cotton production sold under futures contracts, and the prices under those contracts, at different times during the marketing year? If so, please provide summarized versions to the Panel. How does a futures sale impact the producer's entitlement to marketing loan programme payments? BRA, USA

27 Brazil emphasizes that it does not agree with to applying any price-gap calculation method for the calculation of marketing loan payments for AMS purposes. See inter alia Brazil's 27 August 2003 Comments on US Rebuttal Submission, paras. 10-16.

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-477
Brazil's Comment:
15. Brazil notes that the study cited by the United States32 on upland cotton farmers' use of hedging instruments is relatively dated (from 1996) and analyzes a time period during which prices were high. Therefore, it may not reflect farmers' use of hedging instruments during the period of investigation.
16. In addition, Brazil notes that the futures market is not only used as a hedging instrument by US farmers, but also by farmers in other parts of the world, including Brazilian farmers.33 It is also used by speculators.34 It follows that the number of open contracts does not bear any relationship to the amount of the US upland cotton crop hedged by futures contracts at the New York futures market.35
202. Concerning paragraph 7 of the US oral statement, are the expected cash prices shown for February only? Can the US provide the prices for January and March of each year as well? USA
Brazil's Comment:
17. Brazil notes that the expected cash price is not the relevant price for purposes of analyzing the effects of the marketing loan programme. Since any marketing loan benefits are calculated as the difference between the loan rate and the adjusted world price, it would be necessary to look at the expected adjusted world price to draw any conclusions.36 This point is admitted by the United States in paragraph 75 of its 22 December 2003 Answers to Questions: "... because farmers will receive a government payment for the difference between the loan rate and the adjusted world price".37
18. Brazil also notes that the figures presented by the United States differ to a minor degree from the ones presented by Brazil.38 Brazil does not know the reason for these minor differences and does not consider them to be material.

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-478
Brazil's Comment:
19. As a preliminary comment, the United States answer does not rebut evidence from EWG's expert analyst that the EWG data undercounts the amount of contract payment and marketing loan payment subsidies.39 While it undercounts the data, the EWG data and the estimates generated by Brazil's 14/16th methodology for MY 2002 are very close. Brazil estimates the MY 2002 direct payments to current cotton producers at $454.5 million40, while the EWG data shows MY 2002 direct payments to current cotton producers of $451.4 million.41 Similarly, Brazil's estimates that the MY 2002 CCP payments to current cotton producers were $935.6 million42, while the EWG data shows $893 million.43 Thus, as Brazil has argued, the EWG data could certainly be used by the Panel as evidence supporting Brazil's 14/16th methodology, as explained previously and elaborated further below.
20. The US 22 December 2003 response asserts, at paragraph 25, that Brazil has overestimated the support to upland cotton from contract payments. However, the summary US data produced on 18 and 19 December 2003 seems to show that only between 10-20 per cent of US upland cotton producers planted upland cotton on non-cotton base acreage.44 The EWG data showed that, in MY 2002, 15 per cent of the contract payments received by current producers of upland cotton were from other contract acreage crops.45 The United States refused to produce any information regarding current upland cotton production on non-upland cotton base acreage.46 However, the EWG database ­ although understating the amounts ­ supports a finding that farms producing upland cotton received a significant amount of non-upland cotton contract payments. The EWG database therefore also supports an adverse inference by the Panel that the actual data withheld by the United States would show even higher payments to current upland cotton producers than the EWG data or the Brazilian estimates. It also demonstrates that the EWG data is not a comparable substitute for the information requested by the Panel on 8 December 2003 and 12 January 2004.47 The EWG data contains no information about acreage planted and, thus, does not allow for any farm-specific allocation. It is also incomplete in terms of actual payments made.
21. The US statement in paragraph 24 of its 22 December 2003 response focuses on the large number of farms not receiving direct payments. What the United States largely ignores is the predominance of very small non-cotton producing farms that receive very small upland cotton base payments. In fact, according to the US summary data, the 45 per cent of farms that received upland cotton contract payments (but did not produce upland cotton) received only between 15 and 25 per cent of the upland cotton contract payments.48 It is undisputed that the bulk of upland cotton is

produced in very large operations49, and the EWG data confirms this.50 The EWG data shows that 5 per cent of farms receiving the highest amounts of upland cotton payments account for 41-45 per cent of marketing loan payments, i.e., 41-45 per cent of production. The top 10 per cent of farms account for 55-58 per cent of production, and the top 20 per cent of farms account for 70-72 per cent of production.51
22. The United States makes the assertion in paragraph 25 of its 22 December 2003 response that in MY 2000-2002, "only 71, 77, and 74 per cent respectively of upland cotton base acreage payments went to farms that planted upland cotton". The United States claims this EWG data shows that Brazil's 14/16th methodology overestimates the amount of contract payments to upland cotton. This is incorrect. First, even the incomplete EWG data shows a very high percentage of upland cotton contract payments directly connected with the current production of upland cotton. Second, the EWG data cannot be used to calculate the amount of non-upland cotton base payments attributable to current producers of upland cotton.52 Because the EWG data cannot match contract acreage and planted acreage of the same farm ­ it is payment data, not acreage data. Given the fact that 10-20 per cent of US upland cotton is planted on farms without upland cotton base (but some other base acreage)53, non-upland cotton contract payments would make up for the shortfall alleged by the United States.54 This further highlights the need for the withheld US data. The United States obviously knows what the data shows and can easily calculate the amount of non-cotton base payments allocable to upland cotton production. The US decision not to release even "nonconfidential" data that would show the amount of allocated payments is strong evidence that it knows that the actual data is larger than the EWG and Brazilian estimates.
23. Finally, the United States in paragraph 26 argues that summary data it produced on 18/19 December 2003 shows that in MY 2002, 29.4 per cent of total cropland on farms receiving upland cotton contract acreage payments was planted to upland cotton. This figure is highly misleading, because it includes all of the acreage from farms with upland cotton base acreage that do not plant upland cotton. When only farms that currently produce upland cotton are included, then about 50 per cent of the cropland acreage on these farms that actually produce upland cotton was planted to upland cotton. Indeed, the United States acknowledges this fact in paragraph 186 of its 22 December 2003 Answers to Questions.
24. Further, because of the US refusal to provide the information requested by the Panel on 8 December 2003 and 12 January 2004, it is impossible to determine from the US incomplete summary data the diversity of the cropland for upland cotton producers accounting for the majority of upland cotton production. Indeed, strong evidence that upland cotton producers concentrate in upland cotton production is found in the EWG data, which shows that 85 per cent of the contract payments
as a proxy for payments, which is a conservative proxy, as presumably the less productive farms (i.e. those with lower yields and thus fewer payment units per payments acre and fewer payments per acre) stopped producing upland cotton.

received by upland cotton producers were upland cotton payments.55 This supports USDA's own reports on cotton specialization, which indicate that the considerable bulk of cotton is produced in farms that specialize largely in upland cotton production.56

In so doing, please clarify whether the figures are on a cents per pound basis or some other basis. What averaging method was used? Can you prepare individual charts showing average US and Brazilian cotton prices for each of those third country markets? USA
Brazil's Comment:
25. The United States asserts in paragraph 28 of its 22 December 2003 response that "FOB is greater than FAS except where the vessel is not changed at the port of export, in which case the values are equal". As set forth in the Second Declaration of Andrew Macdonald, "in practice there is in fact no difference in cost between FAS and FOB, since the ship loads and unloads the cargo, and thus, the difference in selling price between cotton which is sold FAS and cotton which is sold FOB is negligible".57 Further, Mr. Macdonald agreed with the US statement quoted above, but noted that "vessels are rarely `changed' in the port," and even if they were, "there would be an insignificant interest loss and thus, no difference between FAS and FOB values".58 Brazil directs the Panel to Mr. Macdonald's Second Declaration, in which he provides additional details supporting his expert opinion.59
26. Brazil notes that the United States does not appear to have any difficulty with comparing Brazilian FOB prices with US FAS prices since it makes this comparison in the graph in paragraph 30 of its 22 December 2003 Answers to Questions. Because of the negligible difference between these two types of prices based on export value, Brazil agrees that there is no difficulty in comparing such FOB and FAS prices. This would include the various pricing comparisons between US and Brazilian prices set out in Brazil's 22 December 2003 Answers to Questions 233 and 235.
27. Finally, Brazil notes the US acknowledgement that the United States used only a "simple average unit price" comparison between US and Brazilian prices in paragraph 30 of its 22 December 2003 response. As Brazil has indicated, from a statistical point of view this is a totally inappropriate way to compare prices because of the enormous distortions it creates.60 The United States should have used "weighted average" unit value pricing comparisons.
207. Please indicate whether any of the measures challenged in this dispute obliges cotton farmers to harvest their crop in order to receive the benefit of the programme (subsidy). USA

the use or export of upland cotton to trigger payments.62 Brazil notes that the crop insurance programme requires farmers to plant upland cotton to receive premium subsidies. No harvest is required from farmers to receive indemnity payments, which in turn may trigger additional reinsurance payments to the private insurance companies running the crop insurance programme.63
208. Please provide data for the marketing years 1992 and 1999-2002 of the "quantity of production to receive the applied administered price" (Agreement on Agriculture, Annex 3, paragraph 8) for purposes of a price-gap calculation of support through the marketing loan programme. USA
Brazil's Comment:
29. Brazil notes that this question directly implicates earlier evidence and arguments demonstrating that the United States has never used a "price-gap" methodology for calculating its marketing loan portion of AMS, inter alia, for upland cotton.64 Rather, the United States has always used and notified a budgetary methodology in accounting for marketing loan payments (marketing loans, loan deficiency, certificate payments, and interest & storage payments).65 In particular, when it agreed with other WTO Members on what the US "base level" would be for purposes of Total AMS, the United States chose to calculate marketing loan payments using a budgetary approach.
30. This is easily seen by first examining Exhibit Bra-19166, which is a document in which the United States notified "supporting material related to commitments on agricultural products contained in Schedule XX - United States". Marketing loan payments for upland cotton are listed on page 20 of the document. The document lists the US loan deficiency payments for upland cotton for MY 1986 as $126.860 million, for MY 1987 as $0.364 million, and for MY 1998 as $42.038 million. Comparing these figures with the actual budgetary outlays for loan deficiency payments in MY 1986-88, as set out in Exhibit Bra-4, show the same figures (rounded out). Similar budgetary outlays are used for marketing loan gains and interest and storage payments that are also related to "marketing loan payments". In addition, Exhibit Bra-19167 contains an Annex which is the "Supporting Table for Cotton: Deficiency Payment Calculation for GATT AMS." This table is there because the United States used the "price-gap" formula of Annex 3, paragraph 10 of the Agreement on Agriculture to calculate the AMS for deficiency payments. But no such supporting table exists for marketing loan payments, because a budgetary approach was used. In short, there is no doubt that the United States Total AMS Commitments were based, inter alia, on the US decision to use budgetary outlays for calculating its marketing loan payments for upland cotton.
31. The US decision under Annex 3, paragraph 10 to use budgetary outlays instead of the pricegap formula in calculating upland cotton AMS for marketing loan payments is legally binding on the United States. Annex 3, paragraph 5 states that "[t]he AMS calculated as outlined below [i.e., paragraphs 6-13 of Annex 3] shall constitute the base level for the implementation of the reduction commitments on domestic support." The marketing loan budgetary decision reflected in G/AG/AGST/USA was incorporated into the US schedules and set the US "base level" of total AMS. The title of the G/AG/AGST/USA suggests its legally binding character ­ "Supporting Tables Relating to Commitments on Agricultural Products in Part IV of the Schedules." These "supporting

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-482
tables" were the basis upon which the "final bound commitment level specified in Part IV" of the US schedule was determined.
32. Annex 3, paragraph 5 of the Agreement on Agriculture indicates that the United States is bound by its initial decision to calculate AMS using a budgetary approach (as permitted in Annex 3, paragraph 10 of the Agreement on Agriculture). This conclusion follows from the text of Article 6.3 of the Agreement on Agriculture:
A Member shall be considered to be in compliance with its domestic support reduction commitments in any year in which its domestic support in favour of agricultural producers expressed in terms of Current Total AMS does not exceed the corresponding annual or final bound commitment level specified in Part IV of the Member's Schedule.
33. Further, Article 3.2 provides that "[s]ubject to the provisions of Article 6, a Member shall not provide support in favour of domestic producers in excess of commitment levels specified in Section I of Part IV of its Schedule". The United States' "final bound commitment level specified in Section I of Part IV" of the US Schedule is currently $19.1 billion. Nothing in Article 6 or any other provision of the Agreement on Agriculture permits a Member such as the United States to change its Annex 3, paragraph 10 choice of budgetary or price gap calculations for the purposes of calculating current AMS.
34. Brazil has previously detailed the reasons why permitting Members to reverse the Annex 3, paragraph 10 choice to calculate current AMS for a product would make the disciplines of Article 3.2 and 6.3 of the Agreement on Agriculture inutile.68 The United States never denied it has always notified marketing loan payments using a budgetary approach, and has never rebutted Brazil's arguments that permitting a Member to change its election under Annex 3, paragraph 10 to calculate current AMS would lead to the nullification of a Member's obligations under Articles 3.2 and 6.3. Indeed, the US Answer to Question 208 provides the best example of such a nullification, when the United States admits that "if the applied administered price for marketing years 1999-2002 were compared to the 1992 applied administered price, the resulting negative numbers . . . show the decrease in the level of support from MY 1992."69 Translated, this means that the huge increase in marketing loan payments to $2.5 billion in marketing loan payments in MY 2001 would not be counted towards US total AMS for MY 2001.
35. Brazil emphasizes again that while the United States makes what are theoretical arguments in this dispute, its WTO partners properly rely on the past and most recent US notifications.70 And these notifications consistently demonstrate that the United States properly treats the budgetary outlays for marketing loan payments for cotton as well as other programme crops as part of its total current AMS. These notifications further demonstrate that US budgeted outlays for marketing loans have significantly increased in MY 1999-2002 over the level of such loans in MY 1992.71
36. In light of the arguments and evidence set out above, there is little need for Brazil to comment on the calculations provided by the US 22 December 2003 response. Brazil notes that the US applies a contradictory approach to the quantity of eligible production for MY 1992 and MY 1999-2002. For example, the United States uses actual production figures calculated from harvested acreage for MY 1999-2002, while it calculates eligible production for MY 1992 as planted eligible acreage multiplied

by the yield on harvested acreage.72 This grossly overstates the eligible production. In fact, the US "eligible production" figures even overstate actual production in MY 1992 by 432,333 bales.73 The actual eligible production for MY 1992 was 6.485 billion pounds74, not the 7.748 billion calculated by the United States.75 When compared to the actual production eligible for marketing loans in MY 1999-2002, the Panel can see that significantly greater US upland cotton production was provided marketing loan benefits in each of those later years compared to MY 1992.
209. It is understood that the data in the graph in paragraph 5 of the US oral statement are as at harvest time, while the data in the graph in paragraph 39 of Brazil's oral statement are as at planting time. Please explain why the trend of US acreage increase/decrease differs between these two graphs. BRA, USA
Brazil's Comment:
37. Brazil reemphasizes its position that only planted acres constitute a reliable measure for planting decisions in a single country, such as the United States.76 This is highlighted by the fact that changes in planted and harvested acreage for the United States during MY 1996-2003 do not move in parallel. Contrary to the US assertion that the "movements in acreage figures are fairly similar"77, in fact, the US planted and harvested acreage changes are in entirely opposite directions in 3 out of 8 marketing years78, vary by great magnitudes in a further 3 out of 8 marketing years79, and are "fairly similar" only in 2 out of 8 marketing years.80 This overall picture can hardly be called "fairly similar" movements. Brazil refers the Panel to its 22 December 2003 Answer to Question 21081, demonstrating that in fact US planted acreage and a proxy for worldwide planted acreage move in quite opposite directions, demonstrating that US producers of upland cotton do not take their planting decisions based on the same market-based price factors as other producers worldwide.82
210. Are worldwide planted acreage figures available? BRA, USA
Brazil's Comment:
38. Brazil agrees that no data on harvested acres is available on a worldwide basis. However, Brazil strongly disagrees that the only possible comparison between US and worldwide upland cotton acreage needs to be done on the basis of harvested acreage.83 As discussed before, the only valid measure of farmers planting decisions is planted acres, as harvested acres figures are distorted by variations over time in the abandonment rate.84 Therefore, it is critical to use planted acreage for the

United States in any analysis of congruence in planting decisions between the United States and the rest of the world. However, harvested acres may serve as a proxy for planted acreage on a worldwide basis.85 On this basis, no congruence exists between the planting decisions of US upland cotton farmers and upland cotton farmers worldwide.86 But, even if one were to look at harvested acres for both US and worldwide planting decisions, there is no congruence in the movements.87
211. Brazil presents a graph in paragraph 59 of its further rebuttal submission indicating the increasing cumulative loss incurred by cotton producers. Please comment on the argument that US cotton producers could not continue operating without subsidies. In particular:
(a) to what extent does the use of 1997 survey technological coefficients with annually updated values affect the results?
Brazil's Comment:
39. Brazil reads the Panel's question as requesting the United States to provide an estimate of how much the updated 2003 USDA ARMS 1997 survey overstates the $872 per acre deficit between total costs and market revenue for the period MY 1997-2002. The United States' 22 December 2003 response declines to provide any dollar per acre estimate. Indeed, the US response appears to raise more questions than it provides answers.
40. The United States has claimed that the 2003 USDA cost data used by Brazil in calculating the $872 per acre deficit88 cannot be relied on by the Panel.89 Because this is a fact asserted by the United States, it has the burden of establishing it.90 The Panel should expect the United States, which employees the USDA personnel who created the 2003 cotton update of the 1997 ARMS study, to have provided statements or other evidence from these cost experts explaining why the 2003 update is unreliable and cannot be used by the Panel. No such statements were provided. Brazil has examined the websites of USDA and the US National Cotton Council carefully and cannot find any warnings that the 2003 upland cotton costs and revenue are unreliable. Indeed, the current NCC website provides a direct link to the ERS-USDA costs and returns website for each major US region.91 Presumably, the NCC intended its Members to rely on such data or they would not have included the link. Further, the United States neglected to inform the Panel that the 2003 upland cotton cost and revenue data has benefited from a "new costs of production estimation methodology" implementing the American Agricultural Economics Association (AAEA) Recommendations.92 It is reasonable for the Panel to find that the 2003 cotton updates to the 1997 ARMS study using this new AAEArecommended methodology results in a more accurate estimate of cotton costs and revenues ­ not a less accurate estimate.
41. What the United States attempts to prove in its 22 December 2003 Answer to Question 211(a) is that the use of biotechnology cotton ("BT cotton") has lowered costs, and that somehow these lower costs were not reflected in the annual updated USDA costs and returns surveys. It is noteworthy that the United States now admits that the USDA personnel updating the 1997 ARMS study properly

updated the cost of production data to show increased upland cotton seed costs.93 But, without citing
any proof, the United States asserts that these same personnel that properly updated the cotton cost
data (to reflect increased (BT-cotton and overall) seed costs) improperly failed to "capture the cost savings from technological changes that alter the mix of production activities and inputs."94

42. The credibility of this assertion is difficult to accept given the fact that the US government during the period of investigation touted the productivity benefits of using, inter alia, BT-cotton.95
Indeed, an Economic Research Service-USDA Report updated through 27 October 1999 analyzed ARMS data concerning the use of BT cotton.96 The ERS report identified increased yields and lower
use (and hence costs) of pesticides as indicated below:

Comparison of mean yields shows that in most cases (4 of 7 region/year cases for which data were sufficient) adopters of Bt cotton appear to obtain statistically significant higher yields than nonadopters. Although less prevalent, similar results (2 of 5 cases) were observed for Bt corn. For the case of herbicide-tolerant crops, the results are mixed: only for a few regions and in some years are yields higher for adopters. Most of the time (4 of 5 for corn, 9 of 13 for soybeans, 3 of 5 for cotton), differences in yields are statistically insignificant.

Comparison of mean pesticide acre-treatments for 1997 shows that in most cases (2 of 3) the adoption of Bt cotton reduces treatments of insecticides normally used on the pests targeted by Bt. In 1 of 3 cases, total treatments for all other cotton pests are higher for adopters than nonadopters. Insecticide treatments for Bt-targeted pests on corn are significantly lower for Bt users than for nonusers. Adoption of herbicidetolerant varieties accompanied statistically significant reductions in herbicide treatments in 4 of 8 cases across all crops, mostly for soybeans.

It is difficult to imagine how USDA ERS personnel working with ARMS survey data could arrive at the conclusions of (a) higher yields for BT cotton and (b) lower use of pesticides and chemicals in 1999 as detailed above, but the USDA personnel updating the cotton cost data in 1999-2002 could not. This evidence suggests that because information on the cost savings for using BT cotton were widely available for farmers and the ERS, then they would also be known to those updating the cotton cost survey. Thus, the Panel can conclude that the published USDA cost survey properly identified both cost increases and cost savings.

43. Finally, to attempt to answer the Panel's question concerning the graph at paragraph 59 of Brazil's 18 November 2003 Further Rebuttal Submission, Brazil analyzed the extent to which any alleged overstating of costs could impact on the huge $872 per acre cost-revenue gap. The answer, as outlined below, is very little.

44. To conduct this analysis, Brazil first assumed, contrary to the evidence outlined above, that the USDA employees updating the cost savings data97 "got it wrong". Brazil then determined that the largest published estimate of the possible cost savings for using BT-cotton was $20 per acre.98 The

concludes that the average US cotton farmer using BT ­cotton has "average net incomes . . . increased by $50

per hectare in the United States" The Monsanto assertion of $50 per hectare translates into $20.2 per acre

because one hectare constitutes 2.47 acres.

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-486
next step was to determine that between 1997-2002 an average of 58 per cent of cotton acreage was planted to BT-cotton between MY 1998-2002. This is reflected in the graph below:99
45. With 58 per cent of US acreage between 1998-2002 was planted to BT-cotton, this meant that the average per acre national cotton cost savings was $12 between 1997-2002 (0.58 x $20). But recall that the United States answer claims that the USDA 1998-2002 cost data reflects the cost increases for BT-cotton seed, but not the cost savings from use of fewer chemicals. Therefore, to reflect the net cost savings, Brazil further deducted the difference in between increased cotton-seed in 1997 and between 1998-2002 ($12.8 per acre).100 Thus, in the best-case US scenario, the total amount of average cost savings allegedly not reflected in published USDA data was $24.8 per acre.
46. Brazil recalls that the total six-year deficit between total costs and total revenue from USDA's 2003 revenue and costs estimates (i.e., the updated 1997 ARMS Study) is $872 per acre.101 Brazil then assumed (1) the accuracy of the $12 per acre net cost reduction from using BT-cotton, (2) that the $12 per acre net cost savings existed for the entire 1998-2002 period, and (3) that USDA cost experts updating the 1997 ARMS Study in 1998-2002 were not aware of such cost reductions or improperly failed to include them in the latest USDA update of cotton revenue and costs, then the 1997-2002 deficit between USDA's total reported costs and total market revenue would still be $748 per acre.102
47. In sum, while Brazil believes that at least some of the assumptions listed above are highly questionable, the "best case" that the United States could have put forward (but did not) shows continued huge long-term deficits of $748 per acre between US producers' total costs and their market revenue. In short, the United States has not met its burden of proving that its own USDA data was hopelessly flawed. Brazil and the Panel can properly rely on the 2003 cotton cost and revenue data showing either $872 or $748 average per acre deficits between costs and market revenue during MY 1997-2002. Both figures reflect huge gaps between market revenue and total costs of production. As Brazil has argued, this evidence strongly supports the significant impact of the US subsidies on US production, exports and on world prices.

(ii) Comment on US Argument concerning Canada Dairy
48. Finally, Brazil notes the US attempt to distinguish the Appellate Body's decision in Canada ­ Dairy in paragraph 42 of the US 22 December 2003 Answer to Question 211. In assessing the credibility of these new US arguments, it is instructive to review what the United States argued before the Appellate Body in Canada ­ Dairy. First, on the issue of whether average cost of production data should be used, the United States made the following arguments in Canada ­ Dairy:
[T]he Panel correctly recognized that an individual producer cost of production benchmark was unworkable. The Panel noted that governments rarely have the sort of detailed, producer-specific information that such a test would require. Indeed, as discussed below, Canada itself was unable to supply the necessary data regarding individual producer participation in the CEM market to support its claim that no payments were being made. ... In sum, the Panel's reliance on the CDC's average total cost of production data as a `sufficient, albeit conservative, approximation of the average total cost of production of the Canadian dairy industry' is consistent with the Appellate Body's instruction to sue an average total cost of production benchmark in this case.
49. The Panel will recall that the United States in this dispute has argued that using an average total cost of production was not appropriate.103 Yet, as in Canada ­ Dairy, the issue in this dispute is not whether there are certain producers that may sell cotton (or milk) below their total cost of production. Of course, there will be some efficient producers who will be able to do so, even with few or no subsidies. Rather, the issue generally in both cases is whether, on average, the producers' total costs of production are above the prices received by the producers in the relevant markets. Thus, as in Canada ­ Dairy, the average total cost of production generated by USDA and used by Brazil is more than a "useful approximation".
50. The United States' arguments in this dispute that fixed costs should not be considered by the Panel mirrored arguments made by Canada in Canada ­ Dairy. Consider the following arguments made by the United States (which were accepted by the Appellate Body) in Canada ­ Dairy and which are practically identical to arguments made by Brazil in this dispute:
With respect to imputed costs, the Panel correctly recognized that these are "real costs" that a producer must recoup in order to stay in business over time. In economic terms, these costs represent opportunity costs or the costs associated with opportunities that are foregone by not putting the producers' resources to their best use. The producers' resources include family labour, its managerial services, and its capital. There is a cost associated with using all of these resources. For example, if a farmer foregoes the opportunity to earn cash wages off the farm in order to contribute his labour to the farm's production, the value of his labour is properly counted as an economic cost to the farm even though the farmer does not pay cash wages to himself. Likewise, it makes no sense to suggest, as Canada does, that the farm which hires labour and management services is incurring a cost, while the farm that uses family labour and management is making a profit.104
Likewise, the Panel correctly concluded that there was no basis to exclude the marketing, transportation, and administrative costs included in the CDC cost of production data. ... [T]he panel properly concluded that these are also `real costs'

(see

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-488
that producers must recoup if they are to remain in business over time. ... The costs incurred by the farmer that must be recouped to avoid going out of business do not stop at the `farm gate'.105
Brazil agrees with the United States that all of the costs identified above (which the Appellate Body accepted in its decision) are "real costs" that a producer must recoup "in order to stay in business over time". This is precisely Brazil's point in this case.
51. The United States argues that Canada ­ Dairy is inapposite because "the issue for which Brazil seeks to use total costs is not whether a subsidy exists but to evaluate the effect of the subsidy, an altogether different analysis".106 First, this is incorrect as a factual matter. One use of the total cost of production data by Brazil has been as circumstantial evidence to demonstrate that contract payments are support to upland cotton and that such payments provide a benefit to US upland cotton producers.107 This is directly analogous to the issue of whether the subsidy existed in Article 9.1(c) of the Agreement on Agriculture in Canada ­ Dairy.
52. Second, the evidence of the total cost of production was used in both cases to demonstrate that both dairy and cotton producers were selling their products into a market well below their total costs of production. In Canada ­ Dairy, Canadian producers were selling C-milk into the export market well below their total cost of production. In cotton, the US producers were selling into all identifiable markets at well below their total costs of production.108 And in both cases, the subsidies provided by the Canadian and US governments permitted these producers to continue to produce without regard for the gap between market revenue and total costs of production. In sum, without both the Canada ­ Dairy panel and this Panel examining total costs of production, it would be difficult to determine whether all the alleged subsidies existed, and second, to determine the role that subsidies played in maintaining production.
(a) to what extent do producers base planting decisions on their ability to cover operating costs but not whole farm costs? USA
Brazil's Comment:
53. Brazil generally agrees that covering operating costs are important to producers who are making planting decisions "in the short term ­ that is, the market price for one year".109 And it is true that during a one-year "short term" period, a producer may be able to afford to receive revenue that only meets its operating costs and at least some of the fixed costs.110 But the US 22 December 2003 Answer to Question 211(b) appears to suggest111 that even over a long-term period of time ­ between 5-10 years ­ producers can continue to plant upland cotton oblivious to whether they meet their total costs of production. This is, of course, economic nonsense for agriculture or any other economic sector.

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-489
54. Basic economics holds that no business can continue to operate unless its total costs of production are met over the long term. The United States recognizes this when it states, in its 18 November 2003 Further Rebuttal Submission, that "in the long run, producers will have to cover these asset and overhead (i.e., economic) costs".112 USDA's ERS suggests that the long term is a period between 5-10 years113, and Christopher Ward testified that the normal recovery period for cotton equipment investments is 5-7 years.114 In light of this evidence, Brazil focused on total costs for a six-year period of time between MY 1997-2002 in analyzing the long-term cost/revenue gap.115 By contrast, the US graph at paragraph 47 of its 22 December 2003 Answer to Question 211(b) improperly focuses on only operating costs. Neither the US graph nor the US response provides any hint as to how US cotton producers could survive for six years without market revenue covering their fixed costs, i.e., covering lease or mortgage payments, paying labor, recovering equipment costs, and paying taxes and insurance.116 In fact, the land-specific costs must be paid every year simply to be able to continue farming on leased land or to avoid foreclosure in the case of owner-operators.117
55. The US arguments that economists are only concerned with examining operating costs, and not total costs, are simply not correct. For example, the University of California Cooperative Extension economists conduct a large number of studies regarding costs of production for different types of, inter alia, upland cotton farms in California. Every one of these studies, which are relied on throughout the agricultural industry in California and other states, contains a detailed examination of all types of costs.118 Other economic studies of the cost of production similarly provide for total costs, including the land charge and rents.119
56. Additional evidence that total costs are relevant to planting decisions even in the short term of one year is found in several documents on an intended but not introduced "Cost of Production Insurance Plan for Cotton". The entire intent of this project to develop new a insurance programme was to provide comprehensive insurance covering total costs ­ not just operating costs.120 If upland cotton producers were solely concerned with covering only their operating costs each year, then the project would not also have sought to provide cotton producers with protection from increased fixed

costs such as leasing land, employing workers, and annual financing costs for replacement equipment. Yet, the "Cost of Production Insurance Plan for Cotton" programme focused on annual protection that would include all types of costs, because that is what the sponsors perceived farmers needed.
57. Finally, the Panel should recognize that the most efficient low-cost US producers will be able to withstand lower market prices without the need for significant subsidies for a year or two. But higher-cost producers will not. The ERS study on production costs cited by the United States highlighted the ability of higher-cost producers to survive in the shorter term only through government payments:
Low-cost producers are generally better able to survive periods of low prices and thrive when prices improve, while high-cost producers are often the first to exit farming when prices are low.121
** ** ** **
Also, this cost-price squeeze has put an emphasis on enhancing revenues through a variety of sources, such as government programmes, and on controlling or cutting costs. Government programme support has likely helped many producers remain in business and may explain why structural adjustments in these industries have been gradual.122
Many US upland cotton producers are "high-cost" producers, according to USDA's latest comprehensive cost of production survey.123 Brazil notes that Professor Sumner found that roughly 70 per cent of US planted acreage would continue to be planted to upland cotton even without the US subsidies.124 This finding that 30 per cent of the US cotton acreage would not remain planted to cotton is consistent with the conclusion that it is the category of high-cost cotton producers that would not be able to survive without US subsidies ­ even in the short term.
212. Brazil states in paragraph 37 of its oral statement that studies of Westcott and Price found that the effect of the programme on cotton is to add an additional 1 to 1.5 million acres during marketing years 1999-2001 and to suppress US prices by 5 cents per pound. Does the US reject these findings? Why or why not? USA
Brazil's Comment:
58. At the outset, Brazil notes that USDA economists Westcott and Price are among the most experienced and well-respected USDA analysts, who both have long records of publication of US government reports and other research studies. They have an in-depth knowledge of the marketing loan programme. Further, they received comments and suggestions for their study from leading US agricultural economists such as Professor Bruce Gardner.125 Westcott and Price's study was their best estimate of the effects of the marketing loan programme. It bears repeating that they developed their study independently of this dispute in 2000.
121 Exhibit US-84 (Production Costs Critical To Farming Decisions, William D. McBride, ERS, p. 40). This study includes a graph regarding wheat farmers on page 41 which illustrates that low-cost producers can survive much lower prices while higher-cost wheat farmers require much higher prices even to meet their operating costs. The same dynamic exists for US cotton farmers.

59. The Westcott/Price study is an approved USDA paper published by USDA's Economic Research Service.126 It is only during this dispute that the United States' government began to characterize this study as an "interesting `academic' exercise"127, whereas, outside this dispute, its results represent USDA's official view on the effects of the marketing loan programme.
60. Brazil recalls that the US Payment Limitations Commission, chaired by USDA's Chief Economist, requested Westcott and Price to update their study and analyze the effects of the marketing loan programme in MY 2001.128 This official US Commission never criticized the approach chosen by Westcott and Price; rather, the Payment Limitations Commission relied on it. It is not clear to Brazil why the United States considers this study to be appropriate for analyzing effects of current agricultural policies and for considering policy reform proposals such as more effective payment limitations in a domestic political context, but, when US upland cotton subsidy programmes undergo multilateral scrutiny in a WTO context, the United States considers the very same study to be fatally flawed and unreliable.
61. Indeed, the United States goes so far as to characterize the Westcott/Price study as irrelevant for the analysis of this Panel.129 The United States claims that using baseline projections for the period MY 1999-2001 will not suffice for the Panel's analysis, as the Panel needs to assess "actual conditions".130 Brazil notes that the 2000 USDA baseline actually projected much higher prices than occurred during the period MY 1999-2001, thus the 5-cent per pound price suppression found by Westcott and Price understate the effects of "actual conditions".131 This is confirmed by the fact that, when Westcott and Price used actual data to update their study for the Payment Limitations Commission, their results showed much stronger effects of the marketing loan programme.132 Brazil notes that Professor Sumner has analyzed the effects of the marketing loan programme using actual MY 1999-2001 data.133 Not surprisingly, the overall results of both Westcott/Price studies are in line with Professor Sumner's results.134
62. The United States also rejects the Westcott/Price study because its lagged price analysis based on the 2000 USDA baseline allegedly would not reflect farmers' actual price expectations.135 Brazil and Professor Sumner have addressed the issues of the inappropriateness of using futures prices in complex modeling systems before.136 The undisputed evidence is that ­ as the United States itself admits137 ­ futures market prices cannot be used for such modeling systems.138
63. Brazil also notes that Westcott and Price in their updated MY 2001 analysis used actual MY 2001 prices as farmers' price expectations. This credits farmers with accurate information about

Brazil notes that the United States

understands "actual conditions" to refer to actual price expectations held by US upland cotton producers. These

are, however, as Brazil and the United States agree, "fundamentally unobservable". 131 Brazil also notes that the 2000 USDA baseline contained actual data for MY 1998, i.e., the

Westcott/Price study used USDA's FAPSIM model for retrospective analysis. 132 See Brazil's 7 October 2003 Oral Statement, paras. 31-34. 133 See Annex I of Brazil's 9 September 2003 Further Submission, para. 4, Table I.5e (regarding the

upcoming prices and represents a third approach to modeling price expectations ­ the others being of course lagged prices and futures market prices.
64. In the context of its critique of the Westcott/Price study, the United States repeats its contention that futures market prices are the appropriate indicator for upland cotton farmers' price expectations, and that the effect of the marketing loan programme can be judged by looking at farmers' expectations about the US seasonal average cash price in the upcoming marketing year.139 This approach is simply factually wrong. There is no question that marketing loan payments are based off the adjusted world price ­ not a cash price. Both Brazil and Professor Sumner explained this fact in detail on 2 and 3 December 2003.140 Indeed, the United States acknowledges this fact elsewhere in its 22 December 2003 Answers to Questions.141 Thus, the effects of the marketing loan programme would depend on upland cotton farmers' expectations about the adjusted world price. All of the repeated US arguments that there are no effects of the marketing loan programme for upland cotton in MY 1999-2001 because the expected US cash price was above the loan rate are simply meaningless.142
65. The US argument that the marketing loan programme has no effects if the expected US cash price is above the loan rate is, however, also wrong on its merits. (The same would be true had the United States relied on the correct price ­ the adjusted world price.) Brazil demonstrated that the spread between the January to March quotes of the December futures contract and the adjusted world price is (i) 18.5 cents143 (if measured against the average AWP for the following marketing year) or (ii) 12.22 cents144 (if measured against the December AWPs).145 Subtracting this spread from the average of the January to March quotes of the December futures contract provides the expected adjusted world price (i) for the upcoming marketing year and (ii) for the upcoming December. As Professor Sumner has explained, it is also not at all clear which futures prices to use for any such calculations.146 Taking the quotes of just one month for a single futures contract, as the United States does, is an overly simplistic approach.147 But whether one assumes that farmers look at the average AWP for the upcoming marking year or at some particular AWP for a specific month such as

Also Exhibit US-126 calculates the marketing loan benefit correctly as the difference between the loan rate and the adjusted world price, rather than ­ as implied by the United States in its other arguments ­ as the difference between the loan rate and the cash price.
142 US 22 December 2003 Answers to Questions, para. 51. Brazil is puzzled to learn that the United States continues to ignore these basic facts about the operation of the marketing loan program for upland cotton and continues to rely on this seriously flawed argument. Brazil recalls again that the United States is fully aware of its error, as demonstrated by its statements in paragraph 75 of its 22 December 2003 Answers to Questions and by Exhibit US-126, both of which rely on the adjusted world price as the basis for calculating marketing loan benefits.

December, the fact is that the expected world price has always been well below the loan rate during MY 1999-2002.148
66. Moreover, even if the expected adjusted world price would not have been below the loan rate, that does not mean that there are no effects from the marketing loan programme. As Professor Sumner explained on 3 December 2003, this is because farmers have a probability distribution for the expected adjusted world price. That means they will expect with a certain likelihood that the adjusted world price will be below (or above) the mean of the expectation.149 It follows that even if farmers expect the mean of the probability distribution for the AWP to be above the loan rate, they will nevertheless expect some marketing loan payments to be made.150
67. In sum, Brazil emphasizes that the Westcott/Price studies are important evidence of the effects of the upland cotton marketing loan programme that corroborate the effects found by Professor Sumner and the effects that are implied by all the non-econometric evidence for the effects of the US upland cotton subsidies presented by Brazil.
68. Finally, Brazil notes a new US argument that undercuts the US arguments regarding the peace clause. The United States argues for the first time in its 22 December 2003 Answers to Questions that the marketing loan programme does not guarantee US upland cotton producers 52 cents per pound in income.151 Rather, there is additional revenue generated by the marketing loan programme that increases the effective support level ­ so-called "marketing loan facilitated revenue".152 This revenue results from several sources. First, US farmers receive a domestic farm price when selling their crop. This price is consistently above the adjusted world price, off which the marketing loan payments are based.153 It follows that US farmers receive additional revenue, as the US farm price plus the difference between the loan rate (52 cents) and the adjusted world price (below the US farm price) will exceed 52 cents.154 Second, by cleverly marketing their upland cotton crop, US farmers can maximize this additional marketing loan facilitated revenue, which Westcott and Price assumed to be 14 cents.155
69. In Exhibit US-126, the United States provides monthly data on the amount of additional marketing loan facilitated revenue. This actual data demonstrates considerable additional positive revenue "facilitated" by the marketing loan programme. Thus, using an adjusted world price as the loan repayment rate for upland cotton (as opposed to a local posted county price used for other crops

In addition, Westcott and Price demonstrate that the additional marketing loan facilitated revenue for MY 1999 is 12.7 cents ­ very close to the authors' assumption (Exhibit Bra-222 ("Analysis of the US Commodity Loan Programme with Marketing Loan Provisions," USDA, AER 801, p. 8)). Finally, Exhibit US-126 does not contradict the appropriateness of using 14 cents, as Exhibit US-126 does not provide the entire marketing loan facilitated revenue received by farmers (see Brazil's arguments in the main body of its comment). 152 US 22 December 2003 Answers to Questions, paras. 50-52. Brazil notes that this additional revenue in rare circumstances can also turn out to be negative. 153 See Brazil's 27 October 2003 Answers to Questions, chart at paragraph 172 and Exhibit Bra-311 (Side by Side Chart of the Weekly US Adjusted World Price, the A-Index, the nearby New York Futures Price, the Average US Spot Market Price and Prices Received by US Producers from 1996 to the present). 154 US 22 December 2003 Answers to Questions, paras. 50-52. Brazil notes that this additional revenue may also turn out to be negative, as shown by Exhibit US-126. 155 US 22 December 2003 Answers to Questions, para. 52.

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-494
except rice) increases the revenue guarantee beyond the official loan rate, as shown by the data in Exhibit US-126. This data, however, understates the real effect for two basic reasons. First, it calculates the additional revenue based on an average national cash price that may be quite different from the price an actual upland cotton farmer receives for its crop. Second, and more importantly, it omits the second source of "marketing loan facilitated revenue" ­ the timing decisions of farmers in marketing their crop and taking out marketing loan benefits.
70. The existence of additional marketing loan programme facilitates revenue further highlights the importance of the upland cotton marketing loan programme in assisting upland cotton producers to close the gap between costs and market returns. It also invalidates further the US argument during the peace clause phase of this dispute that a rate of support should be used for purposes of the "peace clause" analysis, as the rate of support is the only measure that the United States controls.156 The United States now admits that it does not control the rate of support either, as the rate of support may be above (or even below) 52 cents, depending on market conditions157, and farmers' timing decisions for the marketing of their crop. Nor does the United States control the flow of marketing loan payments, as there is no mechanism in the upland cotton marketing loan programme to stem or control the flow of upland cotton marketing loan payments. This is precisely one of the reasons that Brazil has challenged this mandatory programme as causing a threat of serious prejudice.
213. What differences, if any, can be observed in the results of econometric models in the literature which use lagged prices and those which use futures prices to analyse the effect of prices on planting decisions? BRA, USA
Brazil's Comment:
71. The United States focuses its response entirely on Professor Sumner's model. In fact, it does not provide an answer to the question posed by the Panel. Brazil recalls that this question asks for differences in results that can be observed from models in the literature that use lagged prices and futures prices. In its 22 December 2003 response to this question, Brazil detailed that there are no comparable models that use futures prices, but that all models discussed in the context of this proceeding ­ as well as all other large-scale multi-commodity models ­ use some variant of lagged prices.158
72. At the outset, Brazil notes that the United States has presented no econometric model in this dispute. The United States has not taken advantage of the economic and econometric expertise of USDA's Economic Research Service to substantiate econometrically its argument that $12.9 billion in upland cotton subsidies have had no effect on production and exports of US upland cotton and have had no effects on US or world prices.
73. Instead, the United States has criticized various aspects of Professor Sumner's model.159 In particular, it has focused its critique on Professor Sumner's approach to modeling farmers' price expectations. However, Professor Sumner and Brazil have effectively rebutted all of these criticisms.160
156 See inter alia US 11 July 2003 First Submission, para. 94; US 22 July 2003 Oral Statement, paras. 12-13.
157 These market conditions are in particular reflected in the spread between the adjusted world price and the cash price received by US upland cotton producers.

74. The United States cites Andrew Macdonald in support of its propositions that futures prices are the better price indicators.161 However, once again, the United States takes a quote out of context. What Mr. Macdonald actually said in the cited paragraph is that New York futures prices are an indicator of the direction in which prices will move in the future, i.e., price trends, not an indicator of actual price in the future.162
75. The United States further cites a US government study that allegedly demonstrates that a certain percentage of US upland cotton producers rely on the New York futures market to price their crop for actual sales.163 While Brazil cautions against the use of the specific results of the study (as it is somewhat dated)164, Brazil agrees that at least some farmers price their crop with reference to the New York futures price. However, what this study does not demonstrate is that US upland cotton producers rely on the futures market in making their planting decisions many months before marketing.
76. The basic question that arises from the US criticism is the following: is Professor Sumner's approach to model farmers' price expectations biased towards generating stronger effects? The United States correctly notes that "[t]he lagged prices used by Brazil and [Professor Sumner] can[,] at best, be an approximation of farmers' price expectations".165 This is an obvious fact; the actual price expectations of thousands of farmers are "fundamentally unobservable".166
77. There are three basic approaches to modeling farmers' price expectations: (1) using lagged prices, (2) using futures market prices if available, and (3) using rational expectations in various forms, including crediting farmers with complete information (i.e., using the actual price as the expected price167).
78. It is not clear that any of these approaches lead to a priori biased results. However, it is standard practice among economists to use lagged prices in a large-scale, multi-commodity econometric policy simulation framework. FAPRI, USDA and the US Congressional Budget Office ("CBO") use lagged prices in their models. Indeed the United States admits that using futures prices for these models is not feasible and has never been done.168 Had Brazil attempted to use this unconventional and untested approach for its model, the United States could have raised legitimate concerns as to the reliability of the model results. Any such results would have been purely speculative.169
79. Indeed, Brazil would have had to develop equations to predict futures prices for those commodities for which a functioning futures market exists. It also would have had to use an altogether different modeling approach for price expectations for crops for which there is no futures market. Again, this would have been purely speculative.170

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-496
80. The approach favoured by the United States is not itself free of problems.171 So far, futures market prices have only been used in statistical estimation using aggregate time-series data and not in econometric policy simulations.172 Using it for modeling purposes raises further questions about the choice of futures contracts, the time period over which quotations are used, and calculations of appropriate spreads, among others.173
81. In sum, there are good reasons that FAPRI, USDA and the CBO use lagged prices in their policy simulation models. The Panel will recall that the FAPRI model (using lagged prices) was influential in the policy-making process leading to the 2002 FSRI Act, and that FAPRI, USDA and CBO models (all of which are based on lagged prices) are used regularly in US policy evaluation and formulation. Professor Sumner's approach uses a simple and commonly used proxy for the fundamentally unobservable price expectations of farmers.174 Brazil is puzzled that the United States now views the very approach that every credible econometric policy simulation model takes as a significant error once this approach is used by Brazil in this dispute.
82. The United States further argues that in years with strong exogenous shocks lagged price models are poor proxies for price expectations.175 The United States criticizes Professor Sumner's MY 2002 results as grossly overstated.176 Brazil notes that it is has never relied on Professor Sumner's results of individual years. Instead, Brazil has used averages of the effects of the US programmes in MY 1999-2002 and MY 2003-2007. Using these averages mitigates any problems that may have existed from the use of lagged prices in any individual year.
83. Finally, Brazil notes that the United States relies on elasticities supplied by Professor Sumner in Annex I to calculate acreage responses from the expected lower cash prices in MY 2002.177 However, these US calculations the United States are meaningless for several reasons. First, the futures prices used by the United States are problematic. Using only a single month's quotes for a single contract does not appropriately model the complexities of farmers' planting and marketing timings.178 Second, it is unclear from the US response whether the United States used an appropriate spread for the calculation of price expectations held by farmers.179 Third, it is therefore unclear whether the United States has calculated the appropriate change in price expectations between MY 2001 and 2002. Finally, even assuming that all of these problems did not exist, the results calculated by the United States using Professor Sumner's elasticities fail to provide meaningful results. These elasticities were applied in Professor Sumner's model to obtain direct effects, i.e., effects before any feedback from the FAPRI US crops model and the CARD international cotton model.180 Thus, the results are nowhere near the results that one would have obtained using Professor Sumner's full Annex I model. For all these reasons, Brazil strongly disagrees with the conclusion that the marketing loan programme did not have any effect in MY 2002. Brazil also recalls its arguments

III. DOMESTIC SUPPORT
214. Please provide a copy of regulations regarding the marketing loan programme and loan deficiency payments published at 58 Federal Register 15755, dated 24 March 1993. What does this regulation indicate about the target price? USA
215. Please expand or comment on the statement at paragraph 91 of the US further rebuttal submission that the counter-cyclical target price ceases to be paid when the farm price rises above 65.73 cents per pound. In this scenario, should the Panel disregard Direct Payments? BRA, USA
216. How many times have upland cotton producers been able to update their base acres since 1984? How do upland cotton producers come to note the possibility of future updating? Please provide examples of relevant material. BRA, USA
Brazil's Comment:
84. In addition to its own answer182, Brazil offers two comments to the US response to this question. First, the United States makes a factual mistake in describing the calculation of base acreage under the deficiency payment programme.183 While the United States' description of the calculation of deficiency payment crop base as the rolling five-year average minus the high and low year would be correct for other deficiency payment crops, upland cotton (and rice) had a special provision.184 7 CFR 1413.7(c) mandates the calculation of upland cotton base as "the average of the acreages planted and considered planted to such crop for harvest on the farm in each of the 3 crop years preceding such crop year.185 For farms participating in the programme, all current base acreage was "considered planted".186 Therefore, for the base to change, farmers had to opt out of the programme.187
85. Second, Brazil does not consider credible or relevant a statement by the United States that "[g]iven the current US fiscal situation,"188 any further base update four years from now seems "unlikely". The Panel must determine whether the 2002 FSRI Act update of the direct and countercyclical payment base is a violation of paragraphs 6(a) and (b) of Annex 2 of the Agreement on Agriculture.
217. What is the reason for reducing payments under the PFC and direct payments programmes for planting and harvesting fruit, vegetables and wild rice on certain base acreage? Please comment on the statements by the European Communities that "the reduction in payment for fruit and vegetables, if the EC understands correctly, is in fact designed to avoid unfair competition within the subsidising Member." (EC oral statement at first session, first substantive meeting, paragraph 29) and "To find otherwise would not permit a WTO Member wishing to introduce decoupled payments to take account of important elements of internal competition (...)" (EC response to Panel third party Question No. 5). USA

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-498
Brazil's Comment:
86. The United States does not answer the Panel's first question as to "what is the reason" that PFC and direct payments are reduced for planting and harvesting fruits, vegetables, and wild rice. No reason is provided in the US 22 December 2003 response.
87. Nor does the United States take advantage of the Panel's second question to comment on the statement made by the European Communities that "the reduction in payment for fruit and vegetables, is in fact designed to avoid unfair competition within the subsidizing Member".189 No US comment is provided. The EC argument involves considerable speculation about the "design" of the US measures. With the United States deciding not to provide any such reasons, the Panel is left without a factual basis to know whether the US reduction of payment based on growing fruits and vegetables is intended to "minimize any distortion which may be caused by any decoupled payments in markets which were historically undistorted by subsidies".190
88. The EC argument appears to attempt to impose a "trade distortion" test to the criteria of Annex 2, paragraph 6. However, Brazil notes that the EC argued that a decoupled domestic support measure need not be tested with regard to the "fundamental requirement" in Annex 2, paragraph 1 to determine whether it has "trade distorting effects".191 Nor do any of the specific criteria in paragraph 6(b) of Annex 2 refer to "trade distorting effects".192 Annex 2, paragraph 5 requires the specific criteria of Annex 2, paragraph 6 to be met for a direct payment measure to be included within the green box.
89. But even if Annex 2, paragraph 6(b) included a "trade distorting effects" test, the EC is simply wrong that the elimination or reduction of PFC and direct payments when fruits and vegetables and wild rice are grown does not "distort" trade. The EC argument ignores the distortion in trade in the products on which payments are focused, i.e., upland cotton and the other programme crops rather than fruits, vegetables, and wild rice. Limiting or prohibiting payments for types of products representing 60 per cent of the value of production in a region such as California, Florida, or Arizona has the effect of maintaining production in the 40 per cent of the value of crops for which programme payments are received.193 This "distorts" the trade in the agricultural crops receiving the payment by maintaining or increasing their production. The practical effect of the PFC and direct payment restriction is that the resources are targeted towards certain "types" of crops only. Negotiators intended that measures that were so linked to current production were not properly part of the green box.
90. In light of this evidence, the EC's argument boils down to asserting that trade distortions for products that traditionally have been subsidized should be permitted in order to prevent trade distortion in markets for non-subsidized products. Thus, the EC's argument is not one that would avoid distortions; it is one of maintaining existing distortions, contrary to the object and purpose of the Agreement on Agriculture.194

See US 11 August Answer to Question 31, para. 65 ("if a new measure does not conform to the basic and applicable policy-specific criteria in Annex 2, it will not have the benefit of the presumption that it meets the fundamental requirement of the first sentence."). 193 Exhibit Bra-105 ("Statement of Professor Daniel Sumner at the First Meeting," para. 24); Oral Statement of Brazil, paras. 65-66. 194 See Brazil's 22 August 2003 Rebuttal Submission, paras. 8-9, note 15.

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-499
91. The only thing the US 22 December 2003 response does is to repeat earlier faulty arguments attempting to defend the fruits, vegetables, and wild rice payment limitation.195 The US response is useful because it finally clarifies that the US argument boils down to the assertion that if a direct payment measure does not require production, then it cannot violate Annex 2, paragraph 6. The US 22 December 2003 response states, at paragraph 73, that "paragraph 6 [no subsection listed] prohibits basing payments on production requirements ... ".196 It further states that the reduced PFC and direct payments "are not `related to, or based on, the type or volume of production' since the recipient need not produce anything at all".197 But there has never been an issue whether PFC and direct payments require production. All this means is that they comply with Annex 2, paragraph 6(e), in that "no production shall be required in order to receive such payments". But what about Annex 2, paragraph 6(b), which must be interpreted to have a separate meaning apart from paragraph 6(e)?
92. Paragraph 6(b) focuses on the amount of payments related to the type of production. In other words, if a farmer decides to produce something (recognizing that he or she need not under Annex 2, paragraph 6(e)), does the direct payment provision condition the amount of payment on the type of production undertaken? The answer with respect to the 1996 FAIR and the 2002 FSRI Act for PFC and direct payments is a clear "yes". The amount of the PFC or direct payments falls when prohibited crops are grown ­ and increases when the prohibited crops cease to be grown. These legal provisions send a fairly compelling message to the farmer ­ channel your current production into certain crops to continue receiving the full amount of direct payments today. This re-couples payments to current production.
93. The United States claims, at paragraph 73 of its 22 December 2003 response, that all a producer need do to receive the full payment is to "merely refrain from producing fruit, vegetables, or wild rice".198 This is an interesting dismissal given that the practical effect of this provision is to direct production away from crops that represent up to 60 per cent of the value of available options for cotton farmers in states such as Florida, California, and Arizona.
94. Moreover, the logic of the US argument leads to an evisceration of any disciplines in Annex 2, paragraph 6, and is therefore contrary to the object and purpose of that provision. Consider the following hypothetical: a measure provides for a direct payment that was reduced by 75 per cent if a farmer produced any of 99 per cent of the available crop options; as a practical matter, farmers could only plant one or two crops (or no crops) and still receive the full payment. Under the US argument, because the farmer had no obligation to grow any crops, it could "merely refrain" from producing 99 per cent of available crops. Like the fruits, vegetables and wild rice exception, this argument would emasculate the green box requirement of Annex 2, paragraph 6(b).
218. Please comment on the testimony of USDA Chief Economist Keith Collins cited in paragraph 36 of Brazil's oral statement regarding the trade-distorting and productiondistorting nature of the marketing loan payments. USA
Brazil's Comment:
95. The United States states in its response to this question "that marketing loan payments are potentially production- and trade-distorting".199 Yet, Keith Collins' statement did not say "potentially" production- and trade-distorting. Dr. Collins stated that marketing loan payments "are

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-500
unambiguously trade-distorting and production-distorting".200 This is quite a different statement than the one the United States appears to "agree" to. Coming from the Chief Economist of the USDA, who is one of the most-widely respected agricultural economists, it is positive evidence that marketing loan payments are not only "potentially" production- and trade-distorting, but that these payments have, in fact, "unambiguously" distorted US production and exports of upland cotton. But Dr. Collin's statement also confirms what other evidence in the record already demonstrates: the effect of the marketing loan programme is to sustain economically unviable US production of upland cotton, that in turn increases US exports and suppresses world prices.201
96. In a further response to this question, the United States itself provides the reason why its arguments about the expected cash price as a meaningful measure of the effects of the marketing loan programme are seriously flawed. The United States confirms that marketing loan benefits are not paid off the cash price (so that any expectations about future cash prices would matter), but that "farmers will receive a government payment for the difference between the loan rate and the adjusted world price".202 Thus, what potentially matters in evaluating the effects of the marketing loan programme is the expected adjusted world price, and not the expected cash price.203 Looking at the expected adjusted world price, it is below the loan rate in all marketing years during the period of investigation and, therefore, the marketing loan programme is expected to have a significant effect on US farmers' upland cotton planting decisions.204 This fact confirms all the other evidence presented by Brazil to demonstrate the trade- and production-distorting effects of the marketing loan programme.205
IV. EXPORT CREDIT GUARANTEES
219. Under the Agreement on Agriculture the general position is that the use of export subsidies, both those listed in Article 9.1 as well as those within the scope of Article 1(e) which are not so listed, may only be used within the limits of the product specific reduction commitments specified in Part IV of Members' Schedules. One might therefore have expected that Article 3.3 of the Agreement on Agriculture would have prohibited the use of both listed and non-listed export subsidies in excess of reduction commitment levels in the case of scheduled products and, in the case of non-scheduled products, would have simply prohibited the use of any export subsidy. Instead, the Article 3.3 prohibition is limited in both cases to export subsidies listed in Article 9.1. What significance, if any, does this contextual aspect have for how Article 10.2 might be interpreted having regard, inter alia, to:
(a) the fact that export performance-related tax incentives, which like subsidized export credit facilities were considered as a possible candidate for listing as an Article 9.1 export subsidy in the pre-December 1991 Draft Final Act negotiations, have been held

(for example, in United States ­ Tax Treatment for Foreign Sales Corporations, WT/DS108) to be subject to the anti-circumvention provisions of Article 10.1; and
(b) the treatment of international food aid and non-commercial transactions under Article 10? USA
Brazil's Comment:
97. Brazil agrees with the United States that Article 8 of the Agreement on Agriculture assumes the role the Panel suggests one might have expected Article 3.3 to play.206 Article 8 prohibits the use of both those export subsidies listed in Article 9.1 and those not listed in Article 9.1 other than in conformity with the Agreement on Agriculture and the commitments specified by a Member in its Schedule.
98. However, Brazil does not consider that this fact provides illuminating context for the interpretation of Article 10, including Articles 10.1 and 10.2. The question is whether Article 10.2 of the Agreement on Agriculture exempts or carves-out export credits from the disciplines included in Article 10.1. The Appellate Body has concluded that to exempt or carve-out particular categories of measures from general obligations such as the export subsidy obligations in the Agreement on Agriculture, the exemption or carve-out must be explicit in the text of an agreement.207 Article 10.2 includes no such explicit exemption or carve-out.208 The negotiators knew how to make such an exemption or carve-out explicit, as evidenced by, for example, Article 13 of the Agreement on Agriculture, footnote 15 to Article 6.1(a) of the SCM Agreement, and the second paragraph of item (k) of the Illustrative List of Export Subsidies.209 The United States has not rebutted these arguments.
99. Instead, the United States appeals to what it considers to be "similarity" between the treatment of export credit instruments and international food aid in Articles 10.2 and 10.4.210 These two provisions are fundamentally different, however. Article 10.2 announces Members' intent to work toward negotiations on specific disciplines for export credits, and calls on Members to adhere to those disciplines once they are adopted. As Brazil noted in its 22 December 2003 Answers to Questions, the nature of the disciplines negotiated and the way in which they are transposed into the WTO will dictate the effect they will have on claims against export credits under Article 10.1.211 At least for the time being, however, Article 10.2 does not meet the standard for carve-outs or exemptions set by the Appellate Body in EC ­ Sardines and EC ­ Hormones, and export credits are subject to the disciplines of Article 10.1.212
100. Article 10.4 similarly does not meet the standard for exemptions or carve-outs set by the Appellate Body in EC ­ Sardines and EC ­ Hormones. However, it does provide specific disciplines for international food aid through reference to FAO and Food Aid Convention provisions. In Brazil's

view, Article 10.4 could be considered an example of the situation envisioned in paragraph 56 of Brazil's 22 December 2003 Answers to Questions.213 Article 10.4 sets out a benchmark against which to determine whether particular international food aid measures constitute "export subsidies", within the meaning of Article 10.1. Thus far, the Appellate Body's decisions (in US ­ FSC214 and Canada ­ Dairy215) have directed panels to contextual guidance included in the SCM Agreement for this determination. In a case against international food aid measures, however, a panel could look to the alternative benchmarks set out in Article 10.4 as context for its determination whether those measures constitute "export subsidies" for the purposes of Article 10.1. (A panel could also look to a Member's notifications to the Committee on Agriculture. The United States, for example, notifies international food aid ­ or some portion of the international food aid provided by it ­ as export subsidies to be counted towards its reduction commitments.216)

In respect of the table in paragraph 161 of the US August 22 rebuttal submission (concerning the cohort specific treatment of export credit guarantees), the Panel notes the subsequent US agreement (footnotes 82 and 96 in US further submission of 30 September 2003; footnote 160 in US 18 November further rebuttal submission) to Brazil's assertion (footnote 67 in Brazil's 27 August 2003 comments on US rebuttal submission) that the total figure net of reestimates should be $230,127,023 instead of the figure which originally appeared ($381,345,059).
(a) Please submit a corrected table reflecting all of the necessary information to produce this result, to the extent this is possible for the reasons indicated in footnote 96 in US further submission of 30 September 2003.
Brazil's Comment:
101. The data provided by the United States in the chart accompanying its response demonstrates that using the net present value methodology imposed by the US Federal Credit Reform Act ("FCRA"), premiums for the CCC guarantee programmes over the period 1992-2002 were inadequate to cover the operating costs and losses of the programmes, in the amount of $230 million.217 For a complete assessment under item (j), administrative expenses in the amount of approximately $39 million should be added.218
102. Brazil addresses further the US chart in its comments on other US answers, below.
(b) Please clarify whether and how the Panel should treat the figures in Exhibit BRA-182 for the net lifetime re-estimates for each respective cohort.

Brazil's Comment:
103. The United States' response is inaccurate. In stating that "all of the first five cohorts (19921996), including 1994, are profitable",219 the United States oddly neglects to account for the most recent reestimate data, which it has included in its own chart, provided with its response to question 221(a). That chart shows massive upward reestimates in 2003 for the 1992, 1993, 1994, 1996, 1997 and 2001 cohorts. Accounting for those reestimates, the 1994 cohort, which the United States asserts is nearly closed220, does not show profitability. Nor do the 1997, 1998, 2000, 2001 or 2002 cohorts.
104. The United States is implying that over time, cohorts will turn out to be positive. The data does not support this implication. Upward reestimates continue, even on "older" cohorts, and net results do not suggest profitability with anywhere near the uniformity suggested by the United States.
105. Finally, Brazil emphasizes that showing gains or losses for particular cohorts is not relevant for the purposes of item (j), which calls for the assessment of a "programme" across its entire portfolio.221
(c) The Panel notes that the CCC 2002 financial statement in Exhibit BRA-158 refers to annual "administrative" expenses of $4 million, and that the US has also referred to this figure in its submissions (e.g. US first written submission, paragraph 175). Please confirm whether the figures in the table in paragraph 161 of the US August 22 rebuttal submission (or a corrected version thereof) includes "administrative expenses", of approximately $4 million per year over the period 1992-2002, and explain why (or why not) this affects the substantive result.
Brazil's Comment:
106. Brazil agrees that for a complete assessment under item (j), administrative expenses in the amount of approximately $39 million222 should be added to the $230 million of losses recorded in the chart accompanying the US response to question 221(a), or to $211 million of losses recorded in the Brazilian chart included as Exhibit Bra-193.
(d) Please identify what is considered an "administrative expense" for this purpose.
(e) The Panel notes the US statement in paragraph 160 of its answers to Panel questions following the first meeting that all cohorts are still open although the 1994 and 1995 cohorts will close this year. Is this still an accurate statement? If not, please indicate whether any cohorts have since "closed" for the period 1992-2002.
Brazil's Comment:
107. The United States' response is inaccurate. Using the most recent data available, provided by the United States with its response to question 221(a), the subsidy figure net of reestimates for the 1994 cohort will in fact be positive, indicating losses. Based on this same data, the same thing can be said for other "older" cohorts, such as 1997 and 1998. Moreover, the United States' data demonstrates that 2002 and 2003 reestimates for "older" cohorts 1992, 1993, 1994, 1996 and 1997 are all upward, indicating adjustments for even greater losses than previously anticipated.

108. Brazil emphasizes, however, that showing gains or losses for particular cohorts is not relevant for the purposes of item (j), which calls for the assessment of a "programme" across its entire portfolio.
(f) The Panel notes the current "high" figures for 1997 and 1998 indicated in the original US chart. Pending their confirmation and/or updating by the US, why does the US assert that a cohort will necessarily reach a "profitable" result (for example, the 1994 cohort, which has almost closed still indicates an outstanding amount)? Do "reestimates" reflect also expectations about a cohort's future performance?
Brazil's Comment:
109. Once again, the United States' response is inaccurate. The United States asserts that data for the 1994 cohort indicate profitability.223 Using the most recent data available, however, provided by the United States with its 22 December 2003 response to question 221(a), the subsidy figure net of reestimates for the 1994 cohort will in fact be positive, indicating losses. Based on this same data, the same thing can be said for other "older" cohorts, such as 1997 and 1998. Moreover, the United States' data demonstrates that 2002 and 2003 reestimates for "older" cohorts 1992, 1993, 1994, 1996, 1997 are all upward, indicating adjustments for even greater losses than previously anticipated.
110. The United States shows no evidence to support its assertion that Pakistani and Ecuadorean defaults account for an important part of the poor performance of the 1997 cohort.224 Nor does it offer any evidence to show that those defaults were rescheduled, or that they are performing. Additionally, the United States' assertion that it expects the 1998 cohort to show profitability is not supported by the data included with its response to question 221(a).225 As recently as 2002, upward reestimates were made to the 1998 cohort, indicating that there is no discernible trend of profitability.
111. In any event, Brazil notes that showing gains or losses for a particular cohort is not relevant for the purposes of item (j), which calls for the assessment of a "programme" across its entire portfolio.226
(g) Why should the Panel "eliminate" the 2001 and 2002 cohorts from its examination, as suggested in paragraph 198 of the US further rebuttal submission?
Brazil's Comment:
112. The United States confuses two issues in paragraphs 96-97 of its response.227 First, it notes that reestimates need to be applied to the subsidy estimate included in the prior, actual year column of the US budget, since the original subsidy estimate included in the budget year column of the US budget includes subsidy figures for some guarantees that are budgeted but not in fact granted. In other words, fewer guarantees are granted than were budgeted to be granted. Brazil recognized this in Exhibit Bra-193, as does the United States in the chart included with the US response to question 221(a). Nonetheless, both Brazil and the United States reach the same conclusion ­ over the 10-year period, operating costs and losses outpace premiums collected for the CCC programmes (even before administrative expenses are included in the calculation). The United States tracks losses of $230

million in the chart accompanying its response to Question 221(a), and Brazil tracks losses of $211 million in Exhibit Bra-193.
113. The second point the United States makes is that the data it has presented in its response to question 221(a) includes no "operating experience" with the 2001 and 2002 cohorts.228 This is wholly inaccurate. Estimates of costs and losses are based, first and foremost, on historical experience with borrowers.229 Moreover, the chart included in the US response to question 221(a) shows that reestimates ­ which are in part made to reflect operating results ­ have already been made for both the 2001 and 2002 cohorts.
114. Finally, the United States' assertion that there is a "trend of negative reestimates"230 is not borne out by the data provided by the United States itself, in its response to question 221(a). In 2002, upward reestimates were made for the 1992, 1993, 1994, 1995, 1996, 1997 and 1999 cohorts. Similarly, in 2003, upward reestimates were made for the 1992, 1993, 1994, 1996, 1997, 2001 and 2002 cohorts. It is not at all "reasonable to expect that in the fullness of time the data will ... reflect further negative reestimates for cohorts 2001 and 2002",231 as the United States asserts, for the simple reason that recent data provided by the United States shows significant upward reestimates across all cohorts, including "older" cohorts that are presumably closer to closing.
115. For all of these reasons, the US suggestion that the 2001 and 2002 cohorts should be disregarded by the Panel in its item (j) analysis should be rejected.
(h) Why should the Panel "eliminate", in addition, the 2000 cohort, as also suggested in paragraph 198 of the US further rebuttal submission for which information is presumably more "complete"?
Brazil's Comment:
116. The United States notes that the original subsidy estimate for the 2000 cohort was reduced to reflect the fact that fewer guarantees were granted than were budgeted to be granted.232 This is wholly irrelevant, and does not even remotely imply profitability for those guarantees that were actually issued in fiscal year 2000. As the data provided by the United States in its response to question 221(a) demonstrates, there is still a large positive subsidy estimate, indicating losses, for the 2000 cohort.
117. Moreover, the data provided by the United States in its response to question 221(a) shows that, as cohorts age, downward reestimates can not be assumed. In 2002, upward reestimates were made for the 1992, 1993, 1994, 1995, 1996, 1997 and 1999 cohorts. Similarly, in 2003, upward reestimates were made for the 1992, 1993, 1994, 1996, 1997, 2001 and 2002 cohorts. Brazil also notes that cohorts that are "older" than the 2000 cohort ­ such as the 1994, 1997 and 1998 cohorts, continue to show positive subsidy estimates, or losses.

118. For these reasons, the US suggestion that the 2000 cohort should be disregarded by the Panel in its item (j) analysis should be rejected.
(i) Under the US approach, at what point in time could a Panel ever make an assessment of the programme, if it had to wait for each cohort to be completed before it could be "properly" assessed? Why is it inappropriate for the Panel to include these "most recent years" in its evaluation, as the US suggests in paragraph 199 of its 18 November further rebuttal submission? USA
Brazil's Comment:
119. Brazil notes that the United States has not answered the Panel's question. In the United States' view, it is only appropriate to make an assessment of a programme under item (j) using a net present value accounting methodology once all cohorts in a period are closed. The United States specifically argues as follows:
Not until the cohort is closed can one make an assessment as to whether or not that particular cohort represents a cost to the Federal Government.233
120. According to the United States, no cohort in the period 1992-2002 has yet closed. Therefore, in the United States' view, were the Panel to undertake a 10-year assessment of the CCC programmes under item (j) using a net present value accounting methodology, it could only do so for the period 1982-1991. Of course, since net present value accounting for the CCC programmes only began in 1992, following passage of the FCRA in 1990, subsidy estimate and reestimate figures would be unavailable for this period.
121. In insisting that it is necessary to wait until cohorts are closed to be used for the purposes of item (j), the United States is effectively saying that net present value accounting is not an appropriate way to assess a programme under item (j). As the United States is well aware, the whole point of net present value accounting, endorsed by the US Congress and the President of the United States in the FCRA, is to assess the costs of contingent liabilities, like guarantees, when they are issued, rather than when they are paid (on a default of the underlying loan). Brazil notes that there are important retrospective elements to the net present value accounting methodology imposed by the FCRA ­ initial estimates of costs and losses are based, first and foremost, on historical experience with borrowers234, and reestimates are calculated annually to adjust initial estimates as dictated by actual results. In any 10-year period, of course, the most recent years will have been subject to fewer reestimates than the earlier years. This is not, as the United States suggests, a flaw in the methodology. It is the methodology. The methodology records what the US Congress, the US President and US government accountants agree is a more actuarially appropriate means of assessing the costs and losses of contingent liabilities like guarantees.235
122. The United States' rejection of net present value accounting as an accurate way to make an assessment under item (j) is particularly odd given the United States' conclusion that it would be
233 See e.g. US 11 August 2003 Answers to Questions, para. 159. 234 See e.g. Brazil's 22 August 2003 Rebuttal Submission, para. 113 (including notes 234-235), Exhibit Bra-118 (Federal Accounting Standards Advisory Board, STATEMENT OF FEDERAL FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS NO. 19, Technical Amendments to Accounting Standards for Direct Loans and Loan Guarantees in Statement of Federal Financial Accounting Standards No. 2 (March 2001), p. 16 (para. 36) ("Actual historical experience of the performance of a risk category is a primary factor upon which an estimation of default cost is based.")). 235 Brazil's 22 July 2003 Oral Statement, para. 128.

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-507
inappropriate "to subject the [CCC programmes] to the analytical yoke of the unique circumstances of the Polish and Iraqi defaults over 10 years ago . . ".236
123. The United States had previously made this assertion, albeit only with respect to Iraq.237 The United States has offered no support whatsoever for this assertion238, which is inaccurate in at least two respects. As Brazil has noted, these defaults were not "over 10 years ago". The US General Accounting Office reports that the losses in Iraq occurred over the period 1990-1997.239 Nor are these defaults "unique," as the United States argues. As discussed below in Brazil's comments on the US response to question 225, the evidence regarding write-offs by the CCC (not even mentioning defaults that are not written off) demonstrates that the Iraqi and Polish defaults are not at all "unique".
124. Setting factual inaccuracies aside, if the United States wants to put post-1991 defaults on pre1992 guarantees behind it, it should embrace, rather than reject, the net present value accounting methodology adopted in the FCRA. Using net present value accounting and the FCRA formula to make an assessment of the CCC programmes under item (j), the United States is not held accountable (in these proceedings, at least) for post-1991 defaults on pre-1992 cohorts. Post-1991 activity on pre1992 CCC guarantees is treated separately240, and is not in any way included in the data provided by the United States in its response to question 221(a), or by Brazil in Exhibit Bra-193. Even without the effect of the Iraqi and Polish defaults, both the United States and Brazil conclude that the CCC programmes have lost money over the period 1992-2002 (the United States puts those losses at over $230 million; Brazil at $211 million). (For a complete assessment under item (j), administrative expenses in the amount of approximately $39 million should be added.241)
125. Rejecting the use of net present value accounting to assess the CCC programmes under item (j) does not keep the United States from cherry picking the results of the FCRA formula to make its case. According to the United States, using data for some cohorts that have not yet closed is acceptable, but using data for other cohorts that have not yet closed is not acceptable. Several points are clear regarding the United States' approach.
126. First, it is factually inaccurate for the United States to assert, in paragraph 103 of its response, that "trends" suggest that annual downward reestimates on older cohorts will continue and will grow. The chart included with the US response to question 221(a) indicates upward reestimates in 2002 for every cohort during the period 1992-1999. Similarly, that same chart shows upward reestimates in 2003 for the 1992, 1993, 1994, 1996, 1997 and 2001 cohorts. Moreover, that same chart shows "trends" of positive net subsidy estimates after adjusting for cumulative reestimates, even for cohorts that the United States considers are close to closing ­ 1994, 1997 and 1998. In other words, these aging cohorts are losing money. Thus, it is not at all factually accurate to conclude that reestimates are generally downward as a cohort ages and approaches closure, or that as a cohort approaches closure, the data suggests that it will have made money.
236 US 22 December 2003 Answers to Questions, para. 102. 237 US 22 August 2003 Rebuttal Submission, para. 172. 238 As the party asserting this fact, the United States bears the burden of proving it. See e.g. Appellate Body Report, Japan ­ Apples, WT/DS245/AB/R, para. 157 ("It is important to distinguish, on the one hand, the principle that the complainant must establish a prima facie case of inconsistency with a provision of a covered agreement from, on the other hand, the principle that the party that asserts a fact is responsible for providing proof thereof."). 239 Brazil's 27 August 2003 Comments, para. 65 (and document cited at note 81). 240 See e.g. Exhibit Bra-116 (Office of Management and Budget, Circular No. A-11, Section 185, p. 185-4); Notes to Financial Statements contained in Exhibit US-129 (US Department of Agriculture, Office of Inspector General, Financial and IT Operations, Audit Report, Commodity Credit Corporation's Financial Statements for Fiscal Years 2003 and 2002, Audit Report N° 06401-16-FM (November 2003) p. 15). 241 Exhibit Bra-133 (Guaranteed Loan Subsidy and Administrative Expenses of US Export Credit Guarantee Programmes GSM 102, GSM 103 and SCGP).

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-508
127. Second, even if one accepts the US argument that the 2001 and 2002 cohorts should be left out of the calculation because there are not yet any "operating results" for those years (a point that is itself factually inaccurate, as addressed by Brazil above)242, this does not explain the United States' decision to eliminate the 2000 cohort ­ for which it acknowledges there are "operating results" ­ when it concludes that "cohorts 1992-1999, taken as a whole, currently reflect a net negative reestimate (i.e., profitable performance)".243 When the 2000 cohort is included, the data provided by the United States in the chart accompanying its response to question 221(a) show losses. This is a gross example of the cherry-picking exercise in which the United States would have the Panel engage to gerrymander a result in the United States' favour. Consistent with the Panel's duty to make an objective assessment of the facts, it should not accept this approach.
128. Third, the US approach does not tell the Panel anything about how the CCC programmes fare when assessed under item (j). Item (j) calls for an assessment of the entire portfolios of the programmes themselves.244 In contrast, the US approach only offers some indication of how particular, carefully-selected cohorts are performing (and as discussed in the previous two paragraphs, the results do not even reflect profitability for those cohorts). The data provided by the United States itself demonstrates that using the net present value methodology imposed by the FCRA, premiums for the CCC guarantee programmes over the period 1992-2002 were inadequate to cover the operating costs and losses of the programmes, in the amount of $230 million.245 For a complete assessment under item (j), administrative expenses in the amount of approximately $39 million should be added.246
129. If the Panel does not consider that net present value accounting is an appropriate way of assessing the CCC programmes under item (j), Brazil has also demonstrated that the long-term operating costs and losses of the programmes outpace premiums collected, using a cash-basis accounting methodology. The chart included at paragraph 165 of Brazil's 11 August 2003 Answers, reproduced below, tracks this result:

130. In Exhibit US-128, the United States has also provided data to be used for an assessment of the CCC programmes under item (j) using cash-basis accounting. As discussed further in Brazil's comment to the US response to question 222, the data offered by the United States in Exhibit US-128 leads to the same conclusion, when adjusted to account properly for the impact of rescheduling on defaults.284

131. Finally, an even more fundamental approach demonstrates the incredibility of the United States' assertion that "trends" suggest that the CCC programmes are making and will continue to make profits. Congressional testimony by USDA officials and reports by the US General Accounting Office demonstrate that 1990-1997 defaults on Iraqi and Polish CCC guarantees amounted to approximately $4 billion.285 The US General Accounting Office also noted in 1995 that defaults on Russian and Former Soviet Union GSM 102 guarantees similarly reached $2 billion by the end of 1993, and that despite repeated rescheduling agreements, those debts were not being repaid.286 These defaults were not, therefore, all "over 10 years ago", as the United States suggests at paragraph 102 of its 22 December 2003 response. Nor are they "unique", as the United States also suggests at paragraph 102. In addition to this $6 billion in defaults, the United States' response to question 225 cites to further "written-off" or "forgiven" defaults of $20 million. This does not, of course, account for other defaults that have not yet been written-off or forgiven.

132. Even if premiums collected over the entire lifetime of the CCC guarantee programmes are considered, these defaults, in the amount of over $6 billion, would mean net losses in the amount of

performance of reschedulings". The United States has offered no proof that its reschedulings are performing.
Yet as the party asserting this fact, the United States bears the burden of proving it. See, e.g., Appellate Body
Report, Japan ­ Apples, para. 157 ("It is important to distinguish, on the one hand, the principle that the
complainant must establish a prima facie case of inconsistency with a provision of a covered agreement from,
on the other hand, the principle that the party that asserts a fact is responsible for providing proof thereof."). In
fact, according to the US General Accounting Office, rescheduling of GSM defaults has not historically been
"performing," and has rather been in arrears. See Brazil's 22 August 2003 Comments, para. 99 (and note 94). 285 See Brazil's 11 August 2003 Answers to Questions, para. 167 (second bullet point), citing Exhibit

over $5.5 billion.287 Brazil emphasizes that this is just taking account of the defaults about which Brazil is aware. Brazil also notes that while the United States emphasizes the role of rescheduling in the recovery of defaults (which Brazil disputes in its comments on the US answer to question 222 below), the more than $6 billion in defaults discussed here have not been rescheduled, or at least where they have been (in the case of Russian and Former Soviet Union), they are in arrears.288 This demonstrates that long-term operating un-recovered and non-recoverable costs and losses for the CCC programmes have outpaced premiums collected by a considerable amount.
133. Item (j) does not require the Panel to adopt or to reject any particular methodology to assess the CCC guarantee programmes.289 Nor do the facts require the Panel to endorse any one methodology to determine that the CCC guarantee programmes constitute export subsidies under item (j). Brazil has demonstrated that under any methodology, properly applied, premiums for the CCC guarantee programmes over the period 1992-2002 were inadequate to cover the operating costs and losses of the programmes.
222. For GSM 102, 103 and SCGP, please provide year-by-year amounts from 1992 to 2003 with respect to: (i) cumulative outstanding guarantees; (ii) claims paid; (iii) recoveries made; (iv) revenue from premiums; (v) other current revenue, including interest earned; (vi) interest charges paid; and (vii) administrative costs of running the programmes. Please indicate any allocation methodologies used to calculate administrative costs. USA
Brazil's Comment:
134. Exhibit US-128, provided by the United States in response to this question, allegedly demonstrates that using a cash basis accounting methodology, the CCC export credit guarantee programmes generate money. In fact, the United States claims that revenue collected outpaces total expenses for the three programmes by $666 million. Brazil has offered a similar chart at paragraph 165 of its 11 August 2003 Answers. Brazil's chart demonstrates that the CCC programmes lost $1.048 billion over the period of FY 1993-2002. The total difference between the US result and Brazil's result is $1.75 billion.
135. This figure closely corresponds to the total "Claims Rescheduled" figure reported by the United States in Exhibit US-128.290 Indeed, the difference between the chart provided by the United States in Exhibit US-128 and Brazil's chart in paragraph 165 of its 11 August 2003 Answers lies in the treatment of rescheduled debt.291 The United States treats defaulted guarantees that have
287 Brazil has calculated that the highest amount of premiums that could have been generated would amount to approximately $450 million. See Brazil's 11 August 2003 Answers to Questions, para. 167 (second bullet point). Data included in Exhibit US-128 suggests that Brazil is over-estimating the amounts of premia collected.
288 The US General Accounting Office noted that defaults on Russian and Former Soviet Union guarantees reached $2 billion by the end of 1993, and that despite repeated rescheduling agreements, those debts were not being repaid. Exhibit Bra-181 (US General Accounting Office, Report to the Ranking Minority Member, Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry, US Senate, Former Soviet Union: Creditworthiness of Successor States and US Export Credit Guarantees, GAO/GGD-95-60 (February 1995), p. 50-52 and Table 2.6). Brazil raised this point in its 22 August 2003 Rebuttal Submission (at para. 109, note 226) and its 18 November 2003 Further Submission (para. 251). It remains unrebutted by the United States.
289 See Brazil's 22 December 2003 Answers to Questions, paras. 68-75. 290 The fact that both figures do not match exactly is explained by the fact that the United States analyses data covering FY 1992-2003 on a cohort-specific basis, while the data available to Brazil covers FY 1993-2002 and represents actual performance of the CCC programs during a given fiscal year. 291 If the Panel were to compare all other totals, it would readily see that the totals correspond, taking into account that the US data covers FY 1992-2003 and is on the basis of cohorts, while Brazil's data covers only FY 1993-2002 and represents the actual performance of the programs in a fiscal year. Brazil does not have

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-512
been rescheduled as 100 per cent recovered on the day the terms of the rescheduling are agreed.292 Brazil, on the other hand, has treated rescheduled claims as receivables, until they have been actually recovered.293 Only once CCC actually collects incremental amounts on a rescheduled claim is the corresponding incremental amount of the default considered "recovered" and no longer a loss to CCC.294 Under Brazil's approach, whatever portion of rescheduled claims is collected in a particular year is treated as a recovery, whereas under the United States' approach, the entirety of the rescheduled claims is treated as a recovery at the moment the terms of the rescheduling are agreed.
136. Brazil's approach is the more actuarially appropriate of the two, and is consistent with the cash-basis accounting preferred by the United States in this dispute. Under cash-basis accounting, when financial commitments are rescheduled, they would normally be re-amortized on a new, longer payment schedule that reduces the amount of each periodic payment due from the borrower. Rescheduling does not mean that a creditor collects on an outstanding claim ­ it just means that the creditor hopes to do so in the future by reducing the amount the borrower has to pay each month.295 CCC, in fact, acknowledges that all it possesses following a rescheduling is a receivable, and that not all receivables are collectable.296 (And in fact, CCC rescheduling has historically been in arrears.297) The US approach, therefore, overstates the effect rescheduled guarantees have on claims paid, by automatically treating rescheduled guarantees, in every instance, as actual recoveries of claims paid, at the moment the terms of the rescheduling are agreed. (Indeed, the CCC's Financial Statement for FY 2002 and 2003 confirm that rescheduling of export credit guarantee receivables covered both principle and interest, thereby confirming that not all of the rescheduled debt performs and that additional interest charges were also rescheduled.)298
access to FY 2003 data, as the actual figures for that year will only be published in connection with the FY 2005 budget.
292 See Exhibit US-128. The United States defines "Claims Outstanding" (G) as "Claim Payments" (D) minus "Claims Recovered" (E) minus "Claims Rescheduled" (F). It follows that a rescheduled claim no longer constitutes an outstanding claim at the moment the terms of the rescheduling are agreed. Instead, for accounting purposes, the rescheduling is simply treated as 100 percent recovered.
293 This is the reason that Brazil treats recovered principle as a revenue inflow for accounting purposes. The principle recovered is netted against the claims paid by CCC (see Brazil's 11 August 2003 Answers to Questions, para. 163).
294 Contrary to this approach, the United States nets defaults paid against the sum of recovered and rescheduled defaults (see Exhibit US-128). However, it only hopes to eventually recover rescheduled debt; the rescheduling alone does not mean it will do so.
295 See Exhibit Bra-115 (US General Accounting Office ("GAO"), Report to the Chairman, Subcommittee on Criminal Justice, US House of Representatives Committee on the Judiciary, "Loan Guarantees: Export Credit Guarantee Programs' Long-Run Costs Are High," GAO/NSIAD-91-180, 19 April 1991, p. 3 (Table 1, Note a) ("GAO/NSIAD-91-180") (accounts receivable for the GSM programmes "[i]ncludes delinquent payments and rescheduled debt not yet due.")

137. Brazil maintains its position that it is not appropriate to treat as "recovered" those losses (resulting from defaults) that were actually incurred by the CCC export credit guarantee programmes and that are rescheduled, until such a point in time when the money actually has been recovered. Therefore, Brazil maintains that its cash-basis formula is the appropriate one. It follows that the CCC export credit guarantee programmes suffered losses of $1.1 billion between fiscal years 1993-2002, resulting in a finding that the CCC programmes operate at premium rates inadequate to cover the long-term operating costs and losses of the programmes, within the meaning of item (j).
223. Are the premium rates applicable to GSM 102, 103 and SCGP subject to regular review as to their adequacy in enabling the operating costs and losses associated with these programmes? If so, what criteria or benchmarks are taken into consideration for this purpose? Secondly, how do the premium rates applied compare with the implicit cost of forfaiting transactions and with premiums for export credit insurance? USA
Brazil's Comment:
138. Although the United States asserts that premium rates for the GSM-102, GSM-103 and SCGP programmes are "reviewed annually"299, it offers no evidence to support this assertion.300 As Brazil has already noted, both USDA's Inspector General and the US General Accounting Office have noted the CCC's failure to change its premium rates or to reflect credit risk in those rates ­ and its inability to do so given the one-per cent fee cap included in US law ­ as evidence of a failure to cover costs and losses.301
139. The CCC guarantee programmes are unique financing instruments that are not available on the market.302 Brazil has demonstrated that forfaits and CCC export credit guarantees are not similar financial instruments, and therefore that the terms for forfaits cannot serve as benchmarks against which to determine whether CCC export credit guarantees confer "benefits".303 The United States has offered no evidence that the two instruments "compete as a method for trade financing over comparable tenors in similar markets ...."304 Further, the regulations for the CCC programmes belie the United States' assertion that "an importer does not necessarily realize any benefit from a CCC export credit guarantee".305 The regulations state that the programmes operate in cases where banks "would be unwilling to provide financing without CCC's guarantee".306 To summarize the differences between the two instruments, the essential function of a CCC guarantee is to make possible an export sale that would otherwise be impossible. A forfait, by contrast, does not make an impossible sale possible, but instead merely allows an exporter to collect its receivable without waiting for that receivable to come due.307 This opportunity, offered by the forfait, only arises if the CCC guarantee has made the sale happen in the first place.
299 US 22 December 2003 Answers to Questions, para. 107. 300 As the party asserting this fact, the United States bears the burden of proving it. See Appellate Body Report, Japan ­ Apples, para. 157 ("It is important to distinguish, on the one hand, the principle that the complainant must establish a prima facie case of inconsistency with a provision of a covered agreement from, on the other hand, the principle that the party that asserts a fact is responsible for providing proof thereof."). 301 Brazil's 22 December 2003 Answers to Questions, paras. 63-64. 302 See Exhibit Bra-190 (Affidavit of Marcelo Franco, Seguradora Brasileira de Crédito à Exportação). 303 Brazil's 22 August 2003 Rebuttal Submission, paras. 103-105; Brazil's 27 August 2003 Comments on US Rebuttal Submission, paras. 68-70; Brazil's 7 October 2003 Oral Statement, para. 72; Brazil's 18 November 2003 Further Rebuttal Submission, paras. 233-241; Brazil's 2 December 2003 Oral Statement, para. 79; Brazil's 22 December 2003 Answers to Questions, paras. 65-66. 304 US 22 December 2003 Answers to Questions, para. 109. 305 US 22 December 2003 Answers to Questions, para. 109. 306 Exhibit Bra-38 (7 CFR 1493.10(a)(2) (GSM 102 and GSM 103 regulations)).

140. Even if the two instruments were similar, the United States has not met its burden to establish (under either Article 10.3 of the Agreement of Agriculture, or as the party asserting the fact) that CCC guarantees are provided on terms no better than those offered for forfaiting instruments on the market. Although the United States curiously repeats its argument that it "does not have access to specific implicit rates available in the marketplace"308, Brazil presented evidence regarding forfaiting fees five months ago, with its 27 August 2003 submission. That evidence demonstrates that forfaiting fees are well above fees for CCC export credit guarantees.309 It also demonstrates that unlike CCC guarantee fees, which vary on the basis of only one factor ­ the length of the underlying credit ­ forfaiting fees additionally vary according to the risks involved in the transaction310, as one would expect of any market-based financial instrument.
141. Similarly, export credit insurance and CCC export credit guarantees are not similar financial instruments, and therefore the terms for export credit insurance cannot serve as benchmarks against which to determine whether CCC export credit guarantees confer "benefits". The United States has acknowledged the differences between CCC guarantees and export credit insurance.311 One critical difference, noted by the WTO Secretariat in the WTO document quoted by the United States in paragraph 108 of its 22 December 2003 response, is that premia for insurance vary according to the credit rating or risk status of both the importer and the importing country.312 In contrast, neither importer risk nor country risk have any impact on the premiums payable for GSM 102, GSM 103 or SCGP guarantees.313 Moreover, Brazil notes that while export credit insurance is indeed available for agricultural commodities, export credit insurance for agricultural commodities is limited to 360 days, or the expected/useful life of the commodity in question.314 In contrast, CCC guarantees are available for terms of up to 10 years.315
142. Even if the two instruments were similar, the United States has not met its burden to establish (under either Article 10.3 of the Agreement of Agriculture, or as the party asserting the fact) that CCC guarantees are provided on terms no better than those offered for export credit insurance obtained on the market. The United States argues that "[p]rivate commercial quotes for export credit insurance are simply not available to the United States".316 Brazil attaches two premium fee schedules: first, a fee schedule published by Export Insurance Services, Inc., a private broker for export credit insurance for small businesses offered by the US Export-Import Bank ("Ex-Im Bank") (Exhibit Bra-410); and second, a fee schedule published by Ex-Im Bank itself for export credit insurance for small businesses (Exhibit Bra-409).
143. The Panel will note that the rates in Ex-Im Bank's own fee schedule, which do not even include administrative fees that would be added by a private broker such as Export Insurance Services, exceed those offered for CCC guarantees by considerable margins.317 When administrative

fees levied by a market-based institution are accounted for, the differences become even more pronounced.318
144. This comparison likely understates the extent to which CCC rates are below-market, for two reasons. First, government support from Ex-Im Bank does not constitute a market benchmark for the purposes of Article 1.1(b) of the SCM Agreement.319 Nonetheless, this comparison demonstrates that the CCC guarantee programmes do not even meet non-market benchmarks.320 Second, the comparison involves export credit insurance for small businesses. As noted by the US International Trade Administration's Foreign Commercial Service, export credit insurance for small businesses is offered at reduced premium rates.321
145. Finally, because the provisions address somewhat different disciplines and could require different means of implementation, Brazil reiterates its earlier request that the Panel find that the CCC programmes constitute export subsidies by virtue of both Articles 1 and 3.1(a) of the SCM Agreement and item (j).322

Under a cash-basis accounting methodology of assessing the CCC programmes under item (j), the United States should be held accountable for write-offs and "debt forgiveness" (as defined in paragraph 113 of the US response) that occurred during the period 1992-2002, even if it relates to guarantees that were issued before 1992. Although this is not clear from the US 22 December 2003 response, to the extent that the write-offs catalogued in paragraph 114 of the US 22 December 2003 response are related to defaults that occurred in the period 1992-2002, Brazil presumes that the defaults themselves would be included in the line item (00.01) for default claims, which are tracked in the chart included at paragraph 165 of Brazil's 11 August 2003 Answers to Questions, and reproduced in Brazil's comments on the US response to question 221(i), supra. Applying a cash-basis accounting methodology, Brazil demonstrated that long-term operating costs and losses outpace premiums collected over the period 1992-2002 for the CCC programmes, by $1.083 billion.
226. If a debt was "written off" more than ten years ago, does it still create a cost to the programme? If so, how is this reflected in the 2002 financial statement of the CCC, in Exhibit BRA 158 (or any other material)? USA
Brazil's Comment:
149. As discussed in Brazil's comment on the US response to question 225, if the Panel uses a net present value accounting methodology to assess the CCC programmes under item (j), the United States would not be held accountable (in these proceedings, at least) for write-offs that occurred more than 10 years ago. The reason is that those write-offs would relate to guarantees issued prior to 1992. Activity on CCC guarantees issued before 1992 is not in any way included in the net present value data provided by the United States in its response to question 221(a), or by Brazil in Exhibit Bra193.327
150. Under a cash-basis accounting methodology of assessing the CCC programmes under item (j), the United States would not be held accountable for write-offs and "debt forgiveness" that occurred more than 10 years ago (at least in this proceeding), assuming that the period of review is 1993-2002. This is because the underlying defaults would also have occurred more than 10 years ago, even before the write-offs or forgiveness.
151. However, Brazil would like to correct the United States' mischaracterization of Brazil's position about the 10-year period of review for an assessment under item (j). Brazil does not agree, as the United States asserts, that an examination beyond 10 years is "inappropriate".328 Rather, Brazil
324 As Brazil notes in its comment on Question 221(g), however, estimates of costs and losses made in the context of the FCRA formula are based, first and foremost, on historical experience with borrowers. Thus, prior defaults would tend to lead to positive subsidy estimates on new guarantees.

considers that a 10-year period is adequate in this case to get a picture of the performance of the CCC programmes' portfolio. If the Panel wishes to look beyond that 10-year period, Brazil does not believe that doing so would be "inappropriate". Brazil has noted that should the Panel wish to corroborate evidence showing that over the period 1992-2002, the long-term operating costs and losses for the CCC programmes outpace premiums collected, it could look to CCC's 2003 financial statements, which state that uncollectible amounts on pre-1992 CCC guarantees outpace premiums collected during the period 1981-1991 by nearly $2 billion.329
227. The United States has indicated that Brazil continues to "mischaracterize" the amount of $411 million in the 2002 financial statement of the CCC, in Exhibit BRA 158, pp. 18 & 19. Can the United States please indicate how it believes this amount ­ referred to on p. 19 of the Exhibit as "Credit Guarantee Liability-End of Fiscal Year" - should be properly characterized? How, if at all, does it represent CCC operating costs or losses? USA
Brazil's Comment:
152. In paragraphs 117-118 of its 22 December 2003 response, the United States again rejects use of the FCRA formula as an appropriate methodology to make an assessment of the CCC programmes under item (j), since it is based on "estimates". As noted above, the United States' view is that it is only appropriate to use a net present value accounting methodology once all cohorts in a period are closed.330 In paragraphs 117 and 121 of its 22 December 2003 response, the United States argues that the "credit guarantee liability" figure included in the CCC financial statements, which is calculated using a net present value accounting methodology, does not reflect "losses", within the meaning of item (j), but instead only estimated losses.
153. This does not stop the United States from appealing to the FCRA formula when it believes it suits its purposes to do so. In paragraph 119, the United States cites with approval the $22 million credit guarantee liability figure used in CCC's 2003 financial statements as evidence of "good performance" by the CCC guarantee programmes. Brazil notes, however, that at page 4 of the notes to its 2003 financial statements, CCC defines the term "credit guarantee liability" as "the estimated net cash outflows (loss) of the guarantees on a net present value basis".331 Thus, the $22 million figure still represents a "loss", as does the $230 million cumulative figure listed in the chart included with the US response to question 221(a). For a complete assessment under item (j), administrative expenses in the amount of approximately $39 million should be added.332
154. Finally, Brazil directs the Panel's attention to the massive increase from 2002 to 2003 in the losses CCC considers it will incur at the time all post-1991 guarantee cohorts are closed. At page 15 of the notes to its 2003 financial statements, CCC estimates that when all post-1991 cohorts close, it

228. What accounting principles should the Panel use in assessing the long-term operating costs and losses of these three programmes?

231. Do you believe that the now-expired Article 6.1 and/or Annex IV of the SCM Agreement are relevant context for the Panel's interpretation of Article 6.3? USA
Brazil's Comment:
155. For the reasons Brazil has previously articulated, Brazil disagrees that Article 6.1 and Annex IV of the SCM Agreement are relevant context for interpreting the present text of Part III of the SCM Agreement.334
156. The US 22 December 2003 response to Question 243 confirms the fundamental role that Annex IV plays in its analysis of actionable subsidies in Part III of the SCM Agreement. The United States treats Annex IV as if the title of the Annex were "Calculation of the Total Ad Valorem Subsidization for Subsidies Subject to Part III of the Agreement". But all participants know and agree that Annex IV is dead. If it were not, then Brazil's submissions would certainly have been far more concise, as the total ad valorem subsidization for the US subsidies is 95 per cent over the four-year period of investigation.
157. The US reference in paragraph 131 of its 22 December 2003 Answer to Question 231 to the Appellate Body report in US ­ CVD's on EC Products is inapposite. That case involved countervailing duty measures, not actionable subsidy measures and claims under Part III of the SCM Agreement. The Appellate Body's citation to Annex IV was in the context of citing to a long list of SCM provisions that refer to the "recipient" of a "benefit" in the SCM Agreement. The Appellate Body did not, as the United States seeks to do in this case, use Article IV as the sole legal basis for the wholesale inclusion of countervailing duty methodologies into Part III of the SCM Agreement.
158. In paragraph 132 of its 22 December 2003 Answer, the United States continues to make the assumption that contract payments are "not tied to the production of upland cotton". As a factual

matter, Brazil has demonstrated that contract payments are tied to the production of upland cotton.335 The evidence of much higher upland cotton per-acre payments, among many other facts, demonstrates that the de jure "flexibility" is, in practice, not exercised by upland cotton producers336, and that the bulk of the upland cotton contract payments are paid to current upland cotton producers.337
159. More importantly, while the United States repeats its calls for Brazil to implement various allocation methodologies in paragraph 132 of its 22 December 2003 Answers to Questions, it refuses to provide the information that would allow Brazil or the Panel to even perform a calculation using the flawed US methodology based on Annex IV. And the United States is just plain wrong to suggest in paragraph 132 of its 22 December 2003 response that Brazil has "refus[ed] to countenance any allocation of the decoupled payments it has challenged ... ". Brazil's 20 January 2004 Answer to Question 258 explained in greater detail in Brazil's methodology for allocating the payments.338 Brazil even demonstrated that applying the US allocation methodology with the flawed and incomplete US 18/19 December 2003 data resulted in levels of support to upland cotton that were consistent with Brazil's 14/16th Methodology.339
232. How, if at all, should the Panel take into account the effects of other factors in its analysis of the effects of US subsidies under Article 6.3? If the Panel should compare the effects of other factors to establish the relative significance of one compared to others, how would this be done? What would be relevant "factors" for this purpose?

234. Does "significant" price suppression under Article 6.3(c) necessarily amount to "serious" prejudice within the meaning of Article 5(c)?

Brazil's Comment:
160. The US 22 December 2003 response again ignores the determination of the panel in Indonesia ­ Automobiles, which found that the term "significant" in Article 6.3(c) required examination of a link between the size of the margins of undercutting and whether those margins could "meaningfully affect suppliers of the imported product".340 Under this "meaningfully affect" standard, the focus, at least for the purposes of Article 6.3(c)341, is on producers of the non-subsidized like product. Have their revenue, investments, or crop choices been "meaningfully affected" by the level of price suppression experienced? These are the types of questions that provide guidance as to whether a particular level of price suppression is significant or not. The notion of "meaningfully affect" and "serious prejudice" are, in essence, equivalent for the purpose of Article 6.3(c).
161. The US 22 December 2003 response to Question 234, at paragraph 136, states that "[t]he use of the term `significant' however, would seem to be intended to prevent insignificant price effects from rising to the level of serious prejudice." But this statement presumes some sort of an objective standard exists by which to judge what are "insignificant price effects". The United States provides no suggestions how this Panel or future panels are to make such an abstract determination. The United States' position implies that the "Panel will know them when they see them". But the Article 6.3(c) test, at least, requires the Panel to make an assessment of the relationship between the price effects and serious prejudice. And this link is to be judged by whether the price effects are "significant".
162. The Panel should firmly reject the two-step process suggested by the US interpretation. The first step would require a finding, using some unknown, non-textual standard, of whether a particular price level of suppression is "significant". Evidence that Brazilian producers would have lost $71.5 million during MY 1999-2002 from only one cent per pound of price suppression342 would be totally irrelevant for the first step.343 Only if a panel makes this "significant" finding, divorced from any impact on producers, would it move to the second step, i.e., whether that level of now-significant price effects caused serious prejudice. But such an interpretation, like many proposed by the United States in this dispute, would leave Members who lost millions of dollars due to the effects of subsidies without a remedy. There is no textual basis for such a result, which would be contrary to the object and purpose of the SCM Agreement. In sum, the Panel should adopt the Indonesia ­ Automobiles standard of judging significance in light of whether the particular level of price suppression "meaningfully affects" non-subsidized suppliers of the like product.344
340 "Although the term "significant" is not defined, the inclusion of this qualifier in Article 6.3(c) presumably was intended to ensure that margins of undercutting so small that they could not meaningfully affect suppliers of the imported product whose price was being undercut are not considered to give rise to serious prejudice..." (emphasis added). Panel Report, Indonesia ­ Automobiles, WT/DS54/R, para. 14.254.
341 Brazil notes that Articles 6.3(a), (b) and (d) do not contain similar qualitative or quantitative qualifiers.
342 Brazil's 9 September 2003 Further Submission, para. 258 (citing a $143 million loss from a 2 cents per pound level of price suppression).
343 A good example of evidence that would be irrelevant under the first part of the US test is found in the testimony of Christopher Ward. He indicated that a 10 percent increase in prices for Mato Grosso producers in MY 2000 and MY 2001 would have permitted them to cover their variable costs for MY 2001 and come close to covering variable costs in MY 2000. However, because of the losses they suffered without such revenue increases, many Mato Grosso producers reduced production or were forced out of cotton production. Mato Grosso production fell by 34 per cent between MY 2000 -2001. Exhibit Bra-283 (Statement of Christopher Ward ­ 7 October 2003, paras. 8-10 and accompanying graph).
344 The US example of a per-unit payment of 0.0001 cents per pound in paragraph 136 is irrelevant, because under its hypothetical, this particular level of price suppression could never "meaningfully affect" any suppliers of the like product.

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-521
163. But even if the Panel decides to adopt some sort of numerical standard not reflected in the text of Article 6.3(c), Brazil has also set forth evidence showing that the levels of price suppression found by a number of different economists are "significant".345 In assessing whether the various levels of price suppression found by USDA and other economists are "significant," the Panel should take into account the fact that upland cotton is a primary commodity traded in huge volumes and produced and consumed in a large number of countries. Under these circumstances, any measurable and identifiable effect on the world price from the subsidies provided by a single Member is important. In this case, the Panel is faced with particularly compelling facts ­ during MY 1999-2002 (and even during MY 1997-1998) the record shows that the absolute numerical levels of price suppression caused by some or all of the US subsidies were significant, ranging from 4 to 26.3 per cent of the world price, and 10 to 33.6 per cent of the US price.346
164. Finally, the United States argues in paragraph 136 that the effect of Brazil's interpretation is that any production subsidy would run afoul of Part III of the SCM Agreement, thus turning it into a prohibited subsidies provision. There is no basis for this argument. First, it is difficult to see how extremely low levels of production subsidies (0.0001 cents per pound price effects in the US example) could "materially affect" any competing producers of the non-subsidized Member. Only production subsidies that generate price suppression significant enough to "materially affect" competitors would be subject to the disciplines of Part III. This is far from an insignificant threshold, and gives meaning to the word "significant".
165. Second, this US argument is similar to other arguments it has made to the effect that any limitations on the amount of subsidies would change "actionable" subsidies to "prohibited" subsidies.347 The United States loses sight of the basic fact that an actionable subsidy that creates adverse effects is a violation of WTO rules. No Member has the right to provide unlimited production subsidies if they cause serious prejudice. Members deciding to impose discretionary or mandatory limits on the amount of production subsidies may significantly diminish the possibility that such subsidies create significant price suppression or an ongoing threat of serious prejudice. But it is wrong for the United States to argue that because the only practical way to impose limitations on production subsidies may be some sort of a cap on such subsidies necessarily an actionable subsidy is turned into a "prohibited subsidy".348
235. Please comment on paragraphs 8, 9 and 10 of the US 2 December oral statement, in particular, why the average Brazilian price is shown as lower than the average US price. BRA

Brazil's Comment:
166. Brazil considers it telling that the United States does not provide the percentage figures underlying the chart at paragraph 138 of its 22 December 2003 response. This is because the percentage figures reveal that the US methodology suffers from a fatal flaw.

167. Indeed, as the Panel can readily see, the "rest of the world" "world market share", as defined by the United States, exceeds 100 per cent ­ a result that defies any logic.
168. For the ease of the Panel's reference, Brazil presents an excerpt from its own figures originally presented in Exhibit Bra-302,354 showing that, under Brazil's and USDA's definition of the "world market share," the total world market share equals 100 per cent.

350 "(Non-US Domestic Mill Use (i.e. consumption) + Non-US Exports) / Total World Consumption. 351 US 22 December 2003 Answers to Question, para. 15 and Exhibit US-120. Since the United States

Brazil's Comment:
170. As noted in its 22 December 2003 response to this question, Brazil agrees that a phenomenon that remains at approximately the same level over a given period cannot be considered a consistent trend.355 However, as detailed in that answer, this is not the situation facing this Panel. The data clearly establishes that, in MY 2001, 2002 and 2003, there is an increase in the US world market share over the previous three-year average, and that this increase follows a consistent trend since MY 1996 (and MY 1986).356 In response to this question, the United States again relies on an utterly wrong interpretation of the term "world market share" in Article 6.3(d) of the SCM Agreement.

These figures (11.9 million bales and 13.2 million bales respectively) would replace Brazil's latest information, as contained in Exhibit Bra-302 (11.3 million bales and 11.2 million bales respectively). These new facts strengthen Brazil's threat of serious prejudice claim under Article 6.3(d) and footnote 13 of the SCM Agreement.

does not mean "world consumption share", but world market share of exports, as detailed by Brazil many times, including in these comments.
238. According to the US interpretation of the term "world market share":
(a) should the domestic consumption of closed markets be added into the denominator?
Brazil's Comment:
171. Brazil understands that the Panel's question referred to the distinction between "competitive markets," where world upland cotton producers/exporters compete for available share of world exports, and "closed markets", where no competition for export market share can take place because of subsidies like the domestic Step 2 programme, tariffs, or non-tariff barriers.357 The US 22 December 2003 response, at paragraph 140, affirms that the United States would greatly increase and distort the Article 6.3(d) denominator by including, inter alia, all sales of US upland cotton in the US market. Yet, there is little "international trade" in the US domestic upland cotton market, because there were only marginal imports during MY 1999-2002.358 The effect of the US argument is to obscure and hide the huge volume and market share increase in US exports in "competitive" markets during MY 1998-2003. As Brazil has argued, the US focus on "consumption" as opposed to "trade" is contrary to the text, context, and object and purpose of Article 6.3(d).359 Article 6.3(d) focuses on "trade", not domestic consumption, and thus involves competitive world markets where exports and trade take place.360
172. It is noteworthy that the US answer ignores un-rebutted evidence that USDA's top economists and analysts repeatedly use the phrase "world market share" to describe and analyze how US agricultural exporters are performing in competitive world markets for exports.361 The United States never provided a single instance in which USDA economists ­ or any other Member's economists ­ included domestic US consumption in their analysis of the US "world market share". This is because the unique US notion of "consumption" (which combines exports, domestic use, and imports as part of "consumption") simply does not exist (in the literature or trade statistics) outside of the US arguments in this case.
(b) if US production and consumption increased by the same percentage, whilst the rest of the world's production and consumption remained steady, would this imply an increase in the US "world market share" by a different percentage?
Brazil's Comment:
173. The US 22 December 2003 response in effect acknowledges, at paragraph 142, that the US subsidies could be subject to a challenge under Article 6.3(d) even though those subsidies did not cause any increase in US exports. Under the US theory, even though none of the non-subsidized producer/exporters of upland cotton would have lost any world export market share, these producers could initiate a claim against the United States under Article 6.3(d), in addition to Article 6.3(a), because the US domestic production and domestic consumption increased. This US response
357 Brazil detailed its arguments concerning the focus of Article 6.3(d) on competitive markets and where "trade" takes place in its 7 October 2003 Oral Statement, paras. 38-41.
358 For example, between MY 1999-2001, US imports represented only 0.2 percent of total US mill use of upland cotton. See Exhibit Bra-4 ("Fact Sheet: Upland Cotton," USDA, January 2003, p. 4-5).

highlights the disconnect between its theory and the reality of what Article 6.3(d) really is about ­ the impact of subsidies on trade in the product in question in competitive international markets.
174. Of course, the Part III of the SCM Agreement discipline addressing the Panel's hypothetical factual situation is Article 6.3(a). The United States argues in paragraph 143 that "Brazil's approach ... would allow a larger or even dominant upland cotton consumer to provide huge per-unit production subsidies that increased the share of its own domestic consumption that its production supplied without any disciplines under Article 6.3(d), regardless of the impact on other Members who could potentially supply that increasing domestic consumption" (emphasis added). But what the USposited hypothetical outlines is a classic "displacement or impedence" case under Article 6.3(a). "But for" the "huge per-unit production subsidies", the non-subsidized Member exporters would have increased or maintained their export market share in the market of the subsidizing Member. Thus, interpreting Article 6.3(d) to mean the "world market share of exports" does not leave non-subsidized Member producers who are squeezed out of the subsidizing Member's market without a remedy. And the fact that Article 6.3(d) does not also discipline the situation covered by Article 6.3(a) is hardly surprising, since negotiators presumably intended different provisions to cover different situations.
175. Indeed, the US argument in paragraph 143 highlights the fallacy of its interpretation. It argues that "the ordinary meaning of `world market share' in Article 6.3(d) ... would capture impacts both on the market of the subsidizing Member (as in Article 6.3(a)) and in third-country markets (Articles 6.3(b) and 6.3(c))".362 But if that were true, then there would be no need for Articles 6.3(a) and 6.3(b).363 The US interpretation would render one of the sets of disciplines a nullity, in violation of the customary rules of treaty interpretation as codified in the Vienna Convention.
176. Finally, rather than capturing all the possible instances where subsidies can cause serious prejudice in world markets, the US "consumption" interpretation of "world market share" leaves a gaping hole in the serious prejudice remedies. The facts of this case show how the US interpretation would completely hide the huge US increase in world market share of exports ­ from 25 per cent in MY 1999 to 41.6 per cent in MY 2002. Where a Member uses subsidies to capture export market share in the competitive world market, it causes serious prejudice by limiting the opportunities for non-subsidized Members to increase their exports.364 The record shows that African upland cotton producers, with among the lowest world production costs, actually lost world market share to the United States between MY 1998-2002.365 Yet, the US interpretation of Article 6.3(d) would deny them, as well as Brazil, any remedy to challenge such an increase in the US world market share of exports.
362 US 22 December 2003 Answers to Questions, para. 143. 363 Article 6.3(a) disciplines the situation described in the Panel's question: a Member using subsidies to increase the share of domestic consumption satisfied by domestic supply (i.e., displacing or impeding imports into the market of the subsidizing Member). Article 6.3(b) disciplines such effects of a Member's subsidies (displacing or impeding exports) in a third country market. Article 6.3(c) disciplines significant price effects of a Member's subsidies in all markets.

(c) does Saudi Arabia have a small world market share for oil? USA
Brazil's Comment:
177. Contrary to the US 22 December 2003 response, Brazil has no difficulty appreciating the relevance of the Panel's question. Even accepting the US figures, which include Saudi Arabian consumption of crude oil to produce refined products that are then exported, the US response highlights the significant (25 per cent) difference between their "consumption" methodology and a world market share of exports methodology.366
239. How does the US respond to Brazil's assertions that, under the US interpretation of the term "world market share":
(a) there would be no WTO disciplines on production-enhancing subsidies that increase a Member's world market share of exports? (see paragraph 64 of Brazil's 2 December oral statement);
Brazil's Comment:
178. The US 22 December 2003 response confirms Brazil's arguments that the US interpretation leaves no direct remedy for a Member who either loses or is not able to increase its world market share of exports as a result of another Member's subsidies.367 The United States asserts in paragraph 147 of its answer, that Article 6.3(b) provides such a remedy. But that provision only addresses a non-subsidizing Member's right to contest the effects of subsidies in, inter alia, increasing a subsidizing Member's export market share in an individual third country market. The EC ­ Sugar Exports I (Australia) and EC- Sugar Exports II (Brazil)368 disputes demonstrated how difficult it can be for a non-subsidizing Member to demonstrate displacement or impedence in an individual third country market. Article 6.3(d) helped to address this legal vacuum by providing clear, objective guidelines for subsidizing Members to know when their increase in world market share of exports would be subject to disciplines, and to provide an objective basis for the injured non-subsidized exporting Member to evaluate and protect its rights.
179. The United States further argues, in paragraph 147 of its response, that Article 5(a) of the SCM Agreement would provide a remedy for a non-subsidized Member who lost world market share in exports. But while that provision relates to "injury to the domestic industry of another Member", footnote 11 of the SCM Agreement qualifies that the "injury" "is used in the same sense as it is used in Part V". "Injury" is defined in Article 15.1 et seq. of the SCM Agreement as that caused by (a) the volume of the subsidized imports and the effect of the subsidized imports on prices in the domestic market for like products, and (b) the consequent impact of these imports on the domestic producers of such products. In the context of this dispute, this remedy would appear to apply only to US subsidized exports to the Brazilian market (i.e., the "domestic" market). Contrary to the US argument, Article 5(a) would not address the situation covered by Article 6.3(d), where Brazilian exporters suffer serious prejudice by an increase in the US world market share of exports.
180. Finally, the United States claims, at paragraph 147 of its response, that Article XVI:1 of GATT 1994 would provide Brazil with the right to challenge the US world market share for exports. Brazil agrees that GATT Article XVI:1, as read in conjunction with GATT Article XVI:3, provides for a very analogous recourse as that provided for in Article 6.3(d), i.e., any subsidies that increase exports and lead to an inequitable share of world export trade. But the United States contradicts itself
366 US 22 December 2003 Answers to Questions, para. 145. 367 See e.g. Brazil's 2 December 2003 Oral Statement, para. 64. 368 GATT Panel Report, EC ­ Sugar Exports I (Australia), L/4833 ­ 26S/290, para. 4.26-4.27; GATT Panel Report, EC ­ Sugar Exports II (Brazil), L/5011-27S/69, para. 414.

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-527
in offering up an Article XVI:1 remedy (which is inexorably linked to Article XVI:3, second sentence) in paragraph 147, while arguing elsewhere that this provision is no longer applicable and has been replaced by Article 6.3.369
181. In sum, the Panel is left with the US interpretations that (a) there is no longer any disciplines for a Member suffering from a decrease in its world market share for exports under Article XVI:3, second sentence on the one hand370, and (b) Article XVI:3's presumed successor, Article 6.3(d), does not apply to the world market share of exports. In effect, Members are left without any explicit protection for their loss of world market share of exports due to massive subsidization. Such a result defies the text, context, and object and purpose of Article 6.3(d), as Brazil has repeatedly argued.
182. In any event, whether there may be ­ outside Article 6.3(d) of the SCM Agreement ­ indirect disciplines that may provide some relief to non-subsidizing Members whose rights have been nullified and impaired by a subsidizing Member's increase in world market share of exports does not free the Panel from its obligation to interpret the term "world market share" in Article 6.3(d) in accordance with its "ordinary meaning, in their context and in light of the treaty's object and purpose". Brazil demonstrated that under a Vienna Convention analysis, the term "world market share" means world market share of exports ­ not consumption.371
(b) a Member's exports would have to be disregarded in calculating their "world market share" in terms of "world consumption"? (see e.g. paragraph 65 of Brazil's 2 December oral statement) USA
Brazil's Comment:
183. In paragraph 148 of its 22 December 2003 response, the United States does not address the substance of the Panel's question or Brazil's earlier arguments. That is, the United States does not respond to the fact that its methodology double counts exports as part of the world market share of the exporting country and the importing country.372 In effect, the United States requires this Panel to ignore this illogical conceptual error in its interpretation of the term "world market share". Instead, the United States insists that it is not incumbent upon the Panel "to interpret the term `domestic consumption'".373 Brazil agrees, but that is because the term "domestic consumption" is nowhere to be found in the text or context of Article 6.3(d) of the SCM Agreement. Nor is it consistent with the object and purpose of Article 6.3(d). But since the United States would read "consumption" into that text, then the Panel must closely examine its meaning, using appropriate context to do so. And it should reject the use of that term if it leads to an interpretation that is illogical, leads to absurd results, and otherwise fails to live up to the standards on the interpretation of international treaties, as set out in the Vienna Convention.
240. Does Article XVI:3 of GATT 1994 provide context in interpreting Article 6.3(d) of the SCM Agreement? Do these provisions apply separately? If not, could it indicate that "world market share" is intended to mean the same as "share of world export trade"? USA

Brazil's Comment:
184. Regarding the first question, Brazil has previously detailed the basis for its arguments that Article XVI:3, second sentence of GATT 1994 provides very important context for interpreting Article 6.3(d).374 In response to the Panel's second question, Brazil has demonstrated that these provisions do apply separately, for the reasons Brazil has earlier stated.375 With respect to the third question, the phrase "world market share" in the text of Article 6.3(d) is intended to mean the same thing as "share of world export trade".376
185. The United States points out several differences between Article XVI:3 and Article 6.3(d), one of which is its faulty interpretation that Article XVI:3, second sentence only deals with "export" subsidies. Brazil has earlier demonstrated that the pool of subsidies that could cause serious prejudice is the same for Article 6.3(d) and Article XVI:3, second sentence.377
186. The United States further argues that Brazil agreed in the Tokyo Round Subsidies Code that GATT 1994 Article XVI:3 is limited to export subsidies.378 This is not correct, as demonstrated by the text of the Tokyo Round Code.379 It uses the language "shall include" and "export subsidy" in connection with the notion of a more than equitable share of world trade.380 Thus, an inequitable share of world trade may result from export subsidies, but it is not limited to that source. Moreover, whatever the interpretation of these terms may have been in the now extinct plurilateral Tokyo Round Subsidies Code, the only text that continues to exist is the ordinary meaning of the words used in Article XVI:3, second sentence, which must be interpreted according to its ordinary meaning in its context, and in light of the object and purpose of the GATT. Yet, the United States argues that even that provision is "incapable of definition or application".381
187. The United States argues in paragraph 151 that the use of the term "market" provides the fundamental key to its interpretation. The US argument would include all markets where upland cotton is produced, consumed, or used when it states that Article 6.3(d) is not limited to "markets in international trade". But this argument ignores the fundamental focus of Article 6.3 (as well as Part III of the SCM Agreement itself) on international trade and the impact of subsidies on competition between subsidized and non-subsidized producers and their products. For example, Article 6.3(a) involves situation, in which exporters are impeded or displaced from the market of the subsidizing Member. Articles 6.3(b) and 6.4 involve the situation, in which the export share of a subsidizing Member squeezes out or limits the export share of the non-subsidizing Member in a third

For purposes of Article XVI:3 of the General Agreement and paragraph 1 above:
(a) "more than an equitable share of world export trade" shall include any case in which the effect of an export subsidy granted by a signatory is to displace the exports of another signatory bearing in mind the developments on world markets;
(b) with regard to new markets traditional patterns of supply of the product concerned to the world market, region or country, in which the new market is situated shall be taken into account in determining `equitable share of world export trade'[.]

country market. And the United States has argued that Article 6.3(c) only involves situations, in which prices are suppressed in markets where competition between the subsidized products and the non-subsidized like products take place.382 In essence, the key to initiating a claim under all three of these provisions is demonstrating that "trade" and "competition" have been affected through the use of subsidies.
188. The Panel must ask how is it possible that Articles 6.3(a) ­ (c) only apply to situations where international trade and competition actually take place (or are impeded from taking place), while Article 6.3(d) is totally different ­ it is to be read without any reference to competition and trade at all? The United States asserts that the "world" in "world market share" means the "entire world," without regard to whether there is trade or competition between subsidizing Member products and those of non-subsidizing Members.383 But this slavishly literal reading goes too far. Brazil submits that read in this context, along with the other contextual provisions such as "trade" in footnote 17 of the SCM Agreement, and Article XVI:3, second sentence, that the US interpretation is simply wrong.
189. The United States further argues, at paragraph 149 of its response, that "Brazil has not offered any objective definition" of "equitable share". This is incorrect.384 Further, the fact that certain GATT and WTO provisions express disciplines in broad terms, such as "equitable" or "reasonable" or "serious" or "significant," does not mean that a treaty interpreter can simply throw up his or her hands and find, as the United States urges, that a provision is incapable of interpretation. Article 31 of the Vienna Convention provides that "the words of a treaty are to be given their ordinary meaning, in their context and in light of the treaty's object and purpose".385 Further, the Appellate Body held in US ­ Gasoline that "an interpreter is not free to adopt a reading that would result in reducing whole clauses or paragraphs of a treaty to redundancy or inutility".386 Thus, the Panel should reject this US attempt to condemn Article XVI:3.
190. However, should the Panel decide that GATT Article XVI:3, second sentence is, indeed, inapplicable, then this certainly strengthens the basis for the Panel to interpret the phrase "world market share" in Article 6.3(d) as meaning the "share of world export trade". It is inconceivable that negotiators ­ who certainly did not expressly terminate the application of Article XVI:3, second sentence ­ would also intend, without making it explicit, that there would be no disciplines for subsidies that allowed Members to seize world market share of exports in competitive markets.
241. How does the US reconcile its data on consumption for 2002 in US Exhibit 40, Table 1 with the "consumption" data it refers to in its 30 September submission, paragraph 34, Exhibit US-47 or US-71? USA
Brazil's Comment:
191. The US 22 December 2003 response appears to have clarified that the graph in paragraph 34 of its 30 September 2003 Further Submission relates to US finished cotton fibre consumption, while the "consumption" referred to in Exhibits US-40, US-47 and US-71 relates to upland cotton lint consumption by US textile mills. Brazil has demonstrated the irrationality of the US world market share of upland cotton consumption data in terms of Article 6.3(d). Brazil has also demonstrated the irrelevance of the US arguments concerning the US consumption of finished textile products.387

242. How much of the benefits of PFC, MLA, CCP and Direct Payments go to land owners? If not all of the benefits go to land owners, what proportion goes to producers? USA
Brazil's Comment:
192. The Panel's question is set out in a section entitled "Serious Prejudice" and uses the word "benefit" relating to contract payments. Brazil will address its comments to the US 22 December 2003 response in two senses of the word "benefit". First, Brazil will address its comment with respect to the definition of the term "benefit" as it is used in Article 1.1(b) of the SCM Agreement. Second, the question also appears to address "benefit" in a more generic sense, as it relates to the effects of contract payments on US production, exports, and the world price of upland cotton. Brazil believes it is this second sense of the term "benefit" to which the Panel's question was directed. However, the United States' answer concludes by asserting that "35 per cent of the value of decoupled payments would benefit upland cotton producers"388, suggesting that it interpreted the Panel's question as directed at the term "benefit" in the sense of Article 1.1(b) of the SCM Agreement. The United States also suggests that the remaining 65 per cent of the US contract payments do not constitute a benefit within the meaning of Article 1.1(b) of the SCM Agreement.
"Benefit" under Article 1.1(b) of the SCM Agreement
193. As set forth below, for the purposes of Article 1 of the SCM Agreement, the record shows that 100 per cent of contract payments are paid to the bank accounts of current upland cotton producers on terms that constitute "benefits".
194. Under the 2002 FSRI Act, direct and counter-cyclical payments are only paid to "producers on farms for which payment yields and base acres are established".389 "Producers" are defined in the Act as "an owner, operator, landlord, tenant, or sharecropper that shares in the risk of producing a crop and is entitled to share in the crop availability for marketing from the farm, or would have shared had the crop been produced". A similar definition of "producer" existed for the 1996 FAIR Act.390 As implemented, USDA acknowledges that contract payments "are paid only to farm operators rather than farmland owners, with payment benefits split between the operator and owners in the case of crop-share rental arrangements".391 Thus, the only "landlords" or "owners" who directly receive contract payments are those who are producers of upland cotton, i.e., those that share in the risk of producing an upland cotton crop.392 The USDA study further states that "[t]he operators' receipt of the PFC payments compensates for higher land costs that may result from the effects of the PFC programme".393
195. Brazil has proved that without the receipt of the PFC, market loss assistance, direct and counter-cyclical payments in their bank accounts, US upland cotton producers could not meet their costs ­ including their lease and land-related costs. Even if these current producers may subsequently write checks to their landlords who do not share in the risk of producing a crop, that does not mean that the subsidies that the producers are legally entitled to receive from USDA do not provide them with a "benefit", within the meaning of Article 1.1(b) of the SCM Agreement, as the United States appears to argue. Rather, the full amount of the payment is made to the current producers.

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-531
196. The Appellate Body has held that a "benefit" exists if a financial contribution is received by a "recipient" or a "producer" of the subsidized good on terms more favourable than those available to the recipient in the market.394 Producers of US crops who have contract base acreage receive these payments from USDA. In Canada ­ Aircraft, the Appellate Body established that "a benefit does not exist in the abstract, but must be received and enjoyed by a beneficiary or a recipient", noting that "the term benefit, therefore, implies that there must be a recipient".395 The Appellate Body in US ­ CVD's on EC Products held that "the focus of any analysis of whether a `benefit' exists should be on `legal or natural persons' instead of on productive operations".396 Contrary to the US arguments, it is legally irrelevant for purposes of determining the existence of a "benefit" under the SCM Agreement whether a benefit received by a "recipient" is subsequently transferred to other non-recipients.
197. The United States' 22 December 2003 response continues its efforts to transform this dispute into a countervailing duty investigation based on now-defunct Annex IV of the SCM Agreement. The United States alleges in paragraph 158 of its 22 December 2003 response that only 35 per cent of PFC, market loss, CCP and direct payments "would benefit upland cotton producers". If the United States is using the word "benefit" in the sense of Article 1.1(b) of the SCM Agreement, then the statement is legally as well as factually wrong. As Brazil has demonstrated above, 100 per cent of the four types of contract payments are paid to the bank accounts of current upland cotton producers. Thus, there is no doubt that each of the four contract payment subsidies confers a "benefit" to upland cotton producers.
198. Finally, even if this case was a countervailing duty investigation, under existing CVD procedures, 100 per cent of the contract payments ­ not 35 per cent ­ would be allocated across the production value of the producers. This is, again, because, first, the total amount of benefits to the company producing the subsidized goods would be calculated. No deductions are made depending on how the subsidy is used by the recipients (i.e., to pay rents). 100 per cent of the subsidy is countervailable. Only in case the subsidy is not de facto tied to the production of the subsidized product, is there in a second step an allocation of the benefit (100 per cent) over the total value of the company's production.
Use of "benefit" to assess the amount of subsidies that could cause serious prejudice
199. The more likely use of the term "benefit" in the Panel's question is the extent to which contract payments contributed to and will contribute to the serious prejudice suffered by Brazil. In other words, to what extent do contract payments enhance and support the production and exports of US upland cotton, and to what extent do they suppress world prices? Brazil has produced evidence, inter alia, through Professor Sumner's analysis, that the contract payments have various effects on production, exports and world prices. The isolated effects of these contract payments are less than those created by the marketing loan programme. Brazil acknowledged that one reason why the serious prejudice effects of PFC payments are relatively small is because a certain percentage of the payments were capitalized into land values and subsequently into land rents.397 Brazil noted that this
394 In Canada ­ Aircraft, the Appellate Body found that: ...the word "benefit", as used in Article 1.1(b), implies some kind of comparison. This must be so, for there can be no "benefit" to the recipient unless the "financial contribution" makes the recipient "better off" than it would otherwise have been, absent that contribution. In our view, the marketplace provides an appropriate basis for comparison in determining whether a "benefit" has been "conferred" because the trade distorting potential of a "financial contribution" can be identified by determining whether the recipient has received a "financial contribution" on terms more favourable than those available to the recipient in the market."(emphasis in original and underlining added) Appellate Body Report, Canada ­ Aircraft, WT/DS70/AB/R, para. 157; The same language is included in Appellate Body Report, US ­ CVD's on EC Products, WT/DS212/AB/R, para. 106. 395 Appellate Body Report, Canada ­ Aircraft, WT/DS70/AB/R, para. 154. 396 Appellate Body Report, US ­ CVD's on EC Products, WT/DS212/AB/R, para. 110. 397 Brazil's 27 October 2003 Answer to Question 179, paras. 164-167.

evidence is supported by Professor Sumner's conclusions because significant amounts of the PFC payments (approximately two thirds) were available to generate production effects.398 Finally, Brazil also demonstrated that the total USDA-estimated increase in land values from PFC payments translated into less than one per cent of an upland cotton producers' total costs.399
200. The United States 22 December 2003 response now claims for the first time that only 35 per cent of the value of decoupled payments benefited upland cotton production during the period of investigation.400 Having asserted this fact, the United States bears the burden of proving it.401 But even a cursory look at the evidence proffered by the United States shows that this assertion is simply not true.
201. The US assumption is that every dollar of every contract payment placed into the bank accounts of producers leasing land (approximately 65 per cent of upland cotton land is "leased" or "rented") is immediately required to be paid to non-producer landlords.402 The United States produced no evidence that 100 per cent of even PFC payments (let alone market loss assistance, direct or counter-cyclical payments) to cash rent cotton producers were consumed by increased rents during the period of investigation or since contract payments began in 1996.403 Further, the United States produces no evidence that 65 per cent of the upland cotton land is cash-rented. In fact, only 25 per cent of the US upland cotton land is cash-rented, whereas 40 per cent is share-rented.404 As established above, share-rent lease agreements mean that the landlord is considered a producer of upland cotton. Therefore, even under the flawed US theory, much more than just 35 per cent, in fact at least 75 per cent, should be considered benefits to upland cotton producers.
202. But do the facts even support the US allegation that rents increased because of the contract payments? Indeed, the most recent USDA cotton cost of production data shows that the opportunity cost of land decreased from $58.33 per acre in MY 1997 to $46.76 per acre in MY 2002.405 This data was reinforced by testimony in 2001 by the NCC President, who disagreed with the suggestion that "the payments that we are receiving are increasing land values or holding them up".406 Instead of PFC payments, the NCC President stated his belief that the "strong economy outside of agriculture ... has supported land values ... ".407 This cotton-specific cost data and testimony by the recipients of PFC payments contradicts the US "35 per cent" assumption.

See e.g. Appellate Body Report, Japan ­ Apples, para. 157 ("It is important to distinguish, on the one hand, the principle that the complainant must establish a prima facie case of inconsistency with a provision of a covered agreement from, on the other hand, the principle that the party that asserts a fact is responsible for providing proof thereof."). 402 US 22 December 2003 Answers to Questions, para. 158. 403 Furthermore, even cash-rent landlords also make decisions that affect production such as land levelling, irrigation installation and related investments. Therefore benefits to landlord have significant effects on yields and acreage planted to cotton. 404 Exhibit Bra-16 (Characteristics and Production Costs of US Cotton Farms, USDA, October 2001, p. 23). 405 Exhibit Bra-323 (Costs and Returns of US Upland Cotton Farmers, MY 1997-2002, USDA). 406 Exhibit Bra-41 (Congressional Hearing, "The Future of the Federal Farm Commodity Programmes (Cotton)," House of Representatives, 15 February 2001, Testimony of Robert McLendon, p. 21).

203. It is also possible to test the US "35 per cent" assumption by examining non-cotton-specific cash rent and land value data. If the US assumption were correct, then cash land rents for cropland in states where upland cotton is produced should have increased significantly since the guaranteed PFC payments started in MY 1996. Further, it would be presumed, if the United States is correct, that 65 per cent of all the PFC upland cotton-related payments (as well as the other three contract payments) were captured by increased cash rents for cropland during MY 1996-2002. But this is simply not the case, as demonstrated below.
204. USDA carefully tracks cropland cash rents in all US states. In almost all of the 16 states where cotton is produced, land rents for cropland increased only slightly between MY 1996 and MY 2003.408 This is in contrast to the value of cropland which increased to a far greater extent.409 The United States seeks to have the Panel assume that both cropland values and cash rents increased significantly by stating, in paragraph 156 of its 22 December 2003 response, that "land rent data ... follows the same trend" as land values. This is a misleading statement because, while cash rents increased, they did so at a much lower rate. For example, in Texas, cash rents for land increased 13.5 per cent ($18.50 to $21.00 per acre) during 1996-2003 while the value of an acre of cropland increased 28 per cent, from $674 in 1997 to $937 in 2003.410 The increase in cash rents in Texas is less than the inflation rate (17 per cent) for the seven-year period.411
205. Cash rents in other US states producing upland cotton increased by similar amounts:412

used for upland cotton production, are shown.

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-534
206. As the figures demonstrate, the increase in cash rents is below the inflation rate of 17 per cent in most of the states. The highest numerical increase between 1996 and 2002 is $9 in Mississippi. Being extremely conservative, Brazil has assumed that this Mississippi increase represents the increase in cash rents for all US upland cotton cropland. It follows that for MY 2002 (with 13.8 million acres planted to upland cotton) and with about 25 per cent of upland cotton land cashrented, these $9 mean that $31 million of the total of $454.5 million414 in direct payments found their way into increased cash rents for upland cotton land.415 Thus, USDA's own data shows that only 6.8 per cent of the MY 2002 direct payments could have been attributable to increased cash rents ­ not 65 per cent as the United States asserts.
207. It should be noted that none of this analysis includes CCP payments. If CCP payments were included with direct payments, the percentage share would be even lower. Generally, the United States agrees that cash rents also reflect long-term expectations about crop prices and programme benefits. While direct payments are paid regardless of prices, CCP payments vary with prices. Therefore, one can expect that the payments will be discounted by a margin reflecting the uncertainty about the availability of CCP payments in future years for which cash rents are fixed.
208. The United States claims that cash rents are "sticky" and do not respond quickly to the increased net revenue from the use of the land.416 The United States further suggests that the estimated 34-41 per cent of PFC payments captured for MY 1997 as set out in an August 2003 ERS study will be higher for later years.417 But the evidence outlined above suggests that cash rents for cropland did not increase significantly between MY 1996-2002, and thus do appear to reflect to any considerable extent the effects of PFC or other contract acreage payments. The US assertion amounts to speculation, as the authors of the August 2003 study properly acknowledge.418 Cash rents may be just as easily, if not more, affected by expected low prices for upland cotton, as suggested by the NCC President419, or other factors such as interest rates. The absence of evidence of significant cash rent increases more than seven years after enactment of the 1996 FAIR Act suggests that whatever production effects from direct payments and CCP payments exist presently will continue to exist in the future ­ supporting Brazil's threat of serious prejudice claims.
209. The above discussion has focused on PFC payments, since that is the only type of contract payment for which the United States presented evidence. However, the United States "35 per cent" assumption also was made regarding CCP payments and market loss assistance payments.420 The Panel will look in vain for any evidence produced by the United States that only 35 per cent of MY 2002 CCP payments benefited upland cotton producers who cash rent upland cotton cropland. Because CCP payments are triggered on a year-by-year basis depending on low prices for upland cotton, a non-producing landlord cannot know in what amount CCP payments will be made. Further, as Brazil has demonstrated repeatedly, given the high non-land-related production costs involved in producing cotton, most US producers simply could not profitably produce cotton without CCP

payments. Therefore, there is little, if any, basis for a non-producing landlord to demand increased rents to capture CCP payments.
210. The evidence that is before the Panel indicates that every eligible upland cotton producer planting on upland cotton base acreage (approximately 75 per cent of such producers), received a CCP check in MY 2002.421 The record shows that the high costs of these producers meant that they had to use this money to cover their production costs, including the costs related to the cash rents they were required to pay. Thus, in an immediate "cover your annual costs" sense, 100 per cent of the payments each year of the period of investigation "benefited" the producers of upland cotton.422
211. Similarly, the United States provides no evidence concerning how much of the market loss assistance payments during MY 1998-2001 did not benefit upland cotton farmers. Brazil demonstrated that all producers (not non-producing landlords) planting on upland cotton or other base acreage were entitled to receive market loss assistance payments. The producers had the legal right to receive these payments. Thus, the United States did not meet its burden of showing that only 35 per cent of the market loss payments "benefited" upland cotton production.
212. Finally, the United States provides no evidence to support its argument that only "35 per cent" of the amount of direct payments under the 2002 FSRI Act "benefit" producers of upland cotton. As Brazil demonstrated, in MY 2002, US cotton producers needed all of the direct payment subsidies to cover their production costs and to re-coup losses from MY 2001.
213. Brazil recalls its showing that even under the US approach, the percentage should be 75 per cent rather than 35 per cent, i.e., including land that is owned or share rented by producers. However, also for producers that cash rent their upland cotton land, not all of their contract payments are capitalized in land values and translated into higher cash rents. Thus, by far the greatest portion of contract payments is available to cause production effects along the lines discussed in the literature and by Professor Sumner423, as well as by Brazil.424
214. In conclusion, 100 per cent of the contract payments paid to, received, and deposited in the accounts of current "producers" of upland cotton (applying Brazil's allocation methodology) in MY 1999-2002 constituted a "benefit" within the meaning of Article 1.1(b) of the SCM Agreement.425 The relevant issue regarding "benefit" to production is not, as the United States argues, the amount of the funds paid; this dispute does not involve a countervailing duty investigation. Rather, the focus of any generic "benefit" analysis is on the effects of the subsidies. The record shows that the various types of contract payments stimulated US production of upland cotton to different extents, ranging from 15 per cent for PFC payments to 40 per cent for CCP payments, as estimated by Professor Sumner.426
243. Can the Panel assume that any support at all, even marketing loan programme payments, benefits upland cotton if an upland cotton producer has other agricultural production besides upland cotton? USA

Brazil's Comment:
215. Contrary to the assumption permeating the US 22 December 2003 response, Brazil reiterates that there is no legal requirement for a claimant under Part III of the SCM Agreement to quantify on an ad valorem basis the amount of the challenged US subsidies.427 Annex IV ­ which the US response shows is the only legal basis for its arguments ­ is dead. Even when alive, it only applied to Article 6.1(a), not Article 6.3 of the SCM Agreement. The Panel's obligation under Part III of the SCM Agreement is to conduct an objective assessment of the evidence regarding the "effects" of the challenged subsidies. This means it must first examine the evidence regarding whether each of the supports is a "financial contribution," confers a "benefit," and is "specific".
216. Detailing the precise amount of the financial contribution ending up in the bank accounts of US upland cotton producers is not a legal pre-requisite to Brazil's actionable subsidy claims. If the Panel finds that Brazil is legally required to examine the exact amount of the subsidies in order to assess their "effects," then it need only ask why the United States has refused to produce the evidence to determine such an amount.428 In the absence of the most accurate evidence, withheld by the United States, Brazil refers the Panel to evidence and the allocation of the amount of "support to upland cotton" it has presented in the peace clause portion of its various submissions.429 This evidence is part of the record pursuant to Brazil's alternative arguments and is offered as evidence of the amount of such subsidy payments.
217. With the above-referenced qualifications, Brazil would answer the Panel's question with a qualified "yes". First, Brazil agrees with the United States' assumption, in paragraph 159 of its 22 December 2003 response, that the full amount of marketing loan payments for upland cotton production "benefits" US producers even if they also produce other crops. The logic of the US assumption means that the full amount of crop insurance and Step 2 payments, which are also de jure linked to production, sale or export of upland cotton, would "benefit" upland cotton production. With respect to contract payments, Brazil's allocation methodology first considers every acre of upland cotton grown on an acre of upland cotton contract base to "benefit" (or constitute "support to") upland cotton.430 In other words, Brazil's allocation methodology does assume that all such cotton to cotton matches do "benefit" upland cotton, regardless of the other agricultural production of the farm.431 Brazil notes that the cotton to cotton matches accounts for most of the contract payments to current upland cotton producers.432 However, for those cotton producers growing cotton on non-upland cotton base acres, Brazil does not ignore other agricultural production of the particular farm. Rather, it allocates the payments attributable to upland cotton based on the overall composition of programme crops for that particular farm.433 Of course, Brazil's methodology could not be fully applied because of the refusal of the United States to produce the necessary farm-specific information.434

218. The US 22 December 2003 response highlights the differences between the parties on how to allocate the "benefit" for payments made under the four types of contract payments. Further, the US response reflects the parties' differences over whether the quantification exercise is relevant for the peace clause "support to cotton," or whether it is instead relevant for assessing Brazil's claims under Part III of the SCM Agreement.
219. Brazil's position is that the allocation435 of contract payments is required in the peace clause portion of the proceeding. Brazil has set forth in considerable detail the factual evidence supporting the de facto link between the contract payments and the production of upland cotton.436 Brazil further provided considerable detail concerning its allocation methodology and the application of that methodology.437 Brazil even attempted to apply the US "across the value of the farm" methodology, based on the incomplete and scrambled US data.438 Brazil presented extensive legal arguments supporting the requirement under Article 13(b)(ii) to collect and tabulate any and all support for a specific commodity such as upland cotton.439 For example, Brazil's 22 August 2003 Rebuttal Submission stated:
[T]he phrase "support to a specific commodity" ... read in its context, requires the Panel to tabulate any non-green box domestic support payments that are linked in some manner to the production of upland cotton. Contrary to the US arguments,440 there is nothing in the text of Article 13(b)(ii) limiting the support to only that provided to a single commodity. Nor does the text limit support to only that requiring a recipient to produce or to produce a specific commodity as the United States alleges.441 Rather, it requires examining whether a specific commodity receives support from a domestic support measure identified in the chapeau of Article 13(b) and whether there is some sort of link between the support at issue and the specific commodity.442 Thus, the question of "support to a specific commodity" is fundamentally a factual question requiring an examination of different types of support set out in the chapeau of Article 13(b).443
435 Brazil's 11 August 2003 Answer to Question 40 provided detailed analysis regarding the application of its 14/16th methodology. Brazil explained in its Rebuttal Submission that: "Necessarily, this process requires allocation of support that may be provided to producers of more than one type of agricultural product, but which is not provided to producers in general." See Brazil's 11 August Answer to Question 40. An allocation process is also required with respect to Annex 3 paragraph 7 support to processors of agricultural products," `to the extent that such measures benefit the producers of the basic agricultural product." Brazil's 22 August 2003 Rebuttal Submission, note 33.
436 The United States has refused to produce the most relevant information ­ the precise amount of contract payments received by current US upland cotton producers. Brazil summarized much of the available evidence, demonstrating that the contract payments are, de facto, tied to the production of upland cotton, in its 9 October 2003 Closing Statement, Annex I.

220. The US 22 December 2003 response reiterates, in paragraphs 161-163, the US peace clause arguments that the absence of any requirement to produce upland cotton in the statutory provisions of the 1996 and 2002 Farm Acts for direct and counter-cyclical payments (as well as PFC and market loss assistance payments) completely insulates these subsidies from any actionable subsidy challenge during the implementation period. Brazil demonstrated how this extremely narrow US "production requirement" test is contrary to the chapeau of Article 13(b)(ii), contrary to the context of Annex 2, paragraph 6(e), contrary to the context of Annex 3, paragraphs 10, 12, and 13, and contrary to the context of the AMS definition in Article 1(a) (referring to "in general"). 444 Brazil also demonstrated that the US "production requirement" test is contrary to the object and purpose of the Agreement on Agriculture, because it carves out huge amounts of amber box subsides from any discipline of the SCM Agreement during the implementation period.445
221. The United States argues, at paragraph 163 of its 22 December 2003 response, that Brazil's allocation methodology "eliminates the concept of non-product specific support for purposes of the peace clause since a non-tied payment may always be allocated according to the recipient's production". Brazil notes again its fundamental disagreement with the US assumption that $935.6 million in CCP payments and $454.5 million in direct payments paid in MY 2002 to current producers of upland cotton are "untied" subsidies.446 The overwhelming evidence in the record shows they are de facto "tied" to upland cotton production.447 Further, the United States incorrectly assumes that "non-product specific support" is the language set out in Article 13(b)(ii). The actual text is "support to a specific commodity", which requires the tabulation ­ and allocation if necessary ­ of any and all support provided to producers, users, or exporters of a particular product. The test is not whether the domestic support requires production, but rather whether the domestic support provides support for the production of a particular commodity.448
222. Further, as Brazil noted in its 11 August 2003 response, all of the domestic support measures challenged by Brazil have an "upland cotton specific link in terms of historic, updated, or present upland cotton acreage, present upland cotton production or prices, or upland cotton groups of insurance policies or other specific upland cotton provisions"449 The ordinary meaning of the terms "non-product specific" support that is provided "in general" is support to producers of all or almost all commodities or agricultural products, such as irrigation, state credit programmes, and other infrastructure subsidies such as farm roads. Thus, even if the peace clause test were "product-specific support," Brazil's interpretation does not read out any meaning to "non-product specific support".
223. In sum, Brazil's methodology for allocating the various subsidy payments that "benefit" or "support" upland cotton is reasonable and based on an extensive factual record demonstrating the link between such payments and current upland cotton production. If the United States disagreed, it was required to do more than simply assert the de jure form of the legal instruments of the contract payments. Rather, it must produce the farm-specific evidence that would permit a detailed assessment of the "other agricultural production" (and the value) of each producer of upland cotton. It has refused to do so. Therefore, the US 22 December 2003 response to Question 243, besides being
444 See, in particular, Brazil's 22 August 2003 Rebuttal Submission, paras. 15-22 (legal arguments), as well as factual evidence regarding each direct payment subsidy, in paras. 24-52. Since August, Brazil has presented considerable additional evidence establishing the de facto link between each type of contract payment and the production of US upland cotton. See Annex 1 of Brazil's 9 October 2003 Closing Statement; Brazil's 27 October 2003 Answers to Questions, paras. 7-26, 37-40; Brazil's 18 November 2003 Further Rebuttal Submission, Section 3.7.5; Brazil's 2 December 2003 Oral Statement, Section 5.3.

largely legally and factually wrong, is an astounding display of hubris in light of the US refusal to produce the very evidence that would permit the application of the methodology it advocates.
244. What proportion of the 2000 cottonseed payments benefited producers of upland cotton, given that payments were made to first handlers, who were only obliged to share them with the producer to the extent that the revenue from sale of the cottonseed was shared with the producer? (see 7 CFR §1427.1104(c) in Exhibit US-15). BRA
245. Can a panel take Green Box subsidies into account in considering the effects of nonGreen Box subsidies in an action based on Articles 5 and 6 of the SCM Agreement? BRA, USA
246. Can a panel take prohibited subsidies into account in considering the effects of subsidies in an action based on Articles 5 and 6 of the SCM Agreement? BRA, USA
Brazil's Comment:
224. The Panel is well aware that Brazil considers Article 5 and its reference to "any" subsidy to require the Panel to take prohibited subsidies into account for a serious prejudice claim.450 There is no contradiction between the implementing obligations of a Member under Articles 4.7 and 7.8 of the SCM Agreement. Thus, the Panel must take prohibited subsidies into account in considering the effects of subsidies in an action based on Articles 5 and 6 of the SCM Agreement.
247. Can the Panel take into account trends and volatility in market and futures prices of upland cotton after the date of establishment of the Panel? If so, how do they affect the analysis of Brazil's claim of a threat of serious prejudice? BRA, USA
Brazil's Comment:
225. Brazil's 22 December 2003 response to this question covers most of the points raised in the US 22 December 2003 response. In response to the US argument at paragraph 149 that the Panel's terms of reference as well as Brazil's threat claims are limited to subsidy payments up to, but not after, 18 March 2003, Brazil refers the Panel to its Comments to Question 194 above, and to its 20 January 2004 Answer to Questions 257(ii), at paragraphs 17-22. Brazil has, further, responded to improper use of futures prices at the time of planting, instead of the adjusted world price, in its Comments to Questions 212 and 213, above.
VI. STEP 2
248. In respect of the level of Step 2 payments in certain time periods, the Panel notes, inter alia, footnote 129 in the US first written submission; footnote 33 in the US 18 November further rebuttal submission; and Exhibit BRA-350. Have Step 2 payments ever been zero since the elimination of the 1.25 cent per pound threshold in the FSRI Act of 2002? In what circumstances could a Step 2 payment be zero? How does the elimination of the 1.25 cent per pound threshold in the FSRI Act of 2002 affect your response? BRA, USA
Brazil's Comment:
226. Brazil notes the US admission that one of the reasons for the elimination of the 1.25 cent threshold is to "correct for some long term changes in the valuation of currencies".451 Thus, the United States effectively admits that Step 2 payments cause US exports to increase despite the

appreciation of the US dollar. In fact, the United States has never rebutted the considerable evidence that one of the main effects of the US upland cotton subsidies is to cause US exports of upland cotton to increase even when the US dollar is appreciating rapidly.452
249. The Panel notes that the definition of eligible "exporter" in 7 CFR 1427.104(a)(2) includes "a producer":
(a) How does this reconcile with Brazil's argument that Step 2 "export payments" do not directly benefit the producer?453 How, if at all, would this be relevant for an analysis of the issue of export contingency under the Agreement on Agriculture or the SCM Agreement? BRA
(b) How does this reconcile with Dr. Glauber's statement in Exhibit US-24, p. 3 (referring to "the 1990 Farm Bill and subsequent legislation") that Step 2 payments do not go directly to the producer? USA
(c) What proportion of Step 2 "export payments" go to producers? Please supply supporting evidence. USA
VII. REMEDIES
250. Does Brazil seek relief under Article XVI of GATT 1994 in respect of expired measures? What type of recommendation would the Panel be authorized to make? (Brazil further submission, paragraph 471 (iii)) BRA
251. In light, inter alia, of Article 7.8 of the SCM Agreement, if the Panel were to find that any subsidies have resulted in adverse effects to the interests of another Member within the meaning of Article 5 of the SCM Agreement, should it make any recommendation other than the one set out in the first sentence of Article 19.1 of the DSU? BRA
252. Without prejudice to any findings by the Panel, if the Panel were to find that any of the challenged measures constitute prohibited subsidies within the meaning of Article 3 of the SCM Agreement, what are the considerations that should guide the Panel in making a recommendation under Article 4.7 of the SCM Agreement relating to the time period "within which the measure must be withdrawn"? What should that time period be? BRA
VIII. MISCELLANEOUS
253. Regarding the adjustment authority related to Uruguay Round compliance in s.1601(e) of the FSRI Act of 2002 (the so-called "circuit-breaker provision"):
(a) Does it relate to export credit guarantees, crop insurance and cottonseed payments?
(b) Does it relate only to compliance with AMS commitments?
(c) Is the authority discretionary? If so, can its exercise be limited by the legislative branch of government?
(d) How would the Secretary exercise her authority to prevent serious prejudice to the interests of another Member? How would she exercise her authority to prevent a threat

of serious prejudice to the interests of another Member? At what time and on the basis of what type of information would she exercise her authority?
(e) What does "to the maximum extent practicable" mean? In what circumstances would it not be practicable for the Secretary to exercise her adjustment authority? USA
Brazil's Comment:
227. In its arguments at paragraphs 176, 178 and 180 of its 22 December 2003 response, the United States speculates about the "thoughts," "anticipations," "contemplations," "understandings", and "belief" of the US Congress. Yet it provides no citation to the extensive Congressional debates on the 2002 FSRI Act. Speculation about legislative (or negotiators') intentions not backed up by reference to the record of the debates is not positive evidence. Further, if any Member could successfully plead compliance with WTO rules by simply inserting language asserting the provision "provides assistance to producers in a way that is consistent with [its] obligations under the Uruguay Round Agreement on Agriculture"454, then there would be little role for any WTO panel. The only "evidence" of US legislators' intent before the Panel is the text of the 2002 FSRI Act.
228. In sum, the record now shows that both Brazil and the United States agree that (1) Section 1601(e) applies only to Total AMS455, (2) Section 1601(e) does not apply to serious prejudice caused to US trading partners by US subsidies to upland cotton covered by the 2002 FSRI Act456, and, (3) the 2002 FSRI Act does not provide any discretion for the USDA Secretary specifically to limit the amount of upland cotton marketing loan, Step 2, direct or counter-cyclical payments.457
254. Would payments made after the date of panel establishment be mandatory under the marketing loan, direct payments, counter-cyclical payments and user marketing certificate (step 2) programmes, but for the circuit-breaker provision? USA
Brazil's Comment:
229. Brazil established that marketing loan, Step 2, direct and counter-cyclical payments are mandatory, within the traditional mandatory/discretionary distinction under GATT/WTO law.458 In its 20 January 2004 Answers to Additional Questions, Brazil has responded to US arguments that conditions attached to the payment of subsidies would make these subsidies non-mandatory.459
230. Brazil notes further that the listed programmes are not only mandatory within the meaning of WTO law, but are also mandatory under US budget law. They create a legal entitlement to the payment.460 While the United States now argues that payments depend on the availability of funds461,
454 US 22 December 2003 Answer to Question 253(a), para. 176. 455 US 22 December 2003 Answer to Question 253(b), para. 178. 456 US 22 December 2003 Answer to Question 253(d), para. 180. 457 US 27 October 2003 Answer to Question 162, para 95 ("The statutory authority for marketing loan payments, step 2 payments, and counter-cyclical payments does not provide the Secretary with the authority to arbitrarily decline to make these payments to qualified recipients."), para. 97 ("there is no present limit on the total amount of payments that can be made under each of these programs although for counter-cyclical payments a maximum total outlay can be calculated using the base acres, base yields, and maximum payment rate for each commodity produced during the historical base period."). 458 See Brazil's 20 January 2004 Answers to Additional Questions, paras. 17 (with further references), 24-30. 459 Brazil's 20 January 2004 Answers to Additional Questions, paras. 27-30. 460 Exhibit Bra-416 ("What Is A Farm Bill," Congressional Research Service, Report for Congress, 5 May 2001) ("Commodity programmes are entitlements. Expenditures are based upon programme rules and commodity market conditions. Eligible farmers are guaranteed legislatively-specified support based on these rules and conditions."). USDA noted with respect to an earlier commodity program ­ the deficiency payment

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-542
the legal entitlement nature of these programmes means that payments must be made ­ if necessary after CCC funds have been replenished.
231. Finally, Brazil recalls that the United States argued in the peace clause portion of this dispute that is has no control over the flow of the upland cotton subsidies.462 In fact, there is no legal mechanism to stem, or otherwise control, the flow of these upland cotton subsidies, which cause a permanent source of uncertainty in the world upland cotton market.463 Thus, the US subsidies cause a threat of serious prejudice, in violation of Articles 5(c), 6.3(c) and 6.3(d) as well as footnote 13 of the SCM Agreement, and GATT Articles XVI:1 and 3.
255. How does Brazil respond to US assertions concerning the circuit-breaker provision? (see US 2 December oral statement, paragraph 82). Does this mean that US subsidies cannot be "mandatory" for the purposes of WTO dispute settlement? BRA
256. The United States submits that the Panel cannot make rulings without allocating precise amounts of payments to upland cotton production. However, to the extent that such precise data is not on the Panel record, to what extent can the Panel rely on less precise data, and on reasonable assumptions, in fulfilling its duty under Article 11 of the DSU in this case? USA
Brazil's Comment:
232. Because the United States has refused to cooperate in producing the most precise data concerning the amounts of contract payments to upland cotton producers, the Panel should (1) first draw adverse inferences from the US refusal to cooperate, and (2) use the best information available in making its determination.464 Brazil presents the factual and legal basis permitting the Panel to make findings based on reasonable assumptions in its separate 28 January Comments and Requests Regarding US Data. These separate comments address most of the points raised in the extensive ­ and largely unresponsive ­ US answer to Question 256.465 Additional points are set out below.
233. First, there is relevant WTO jurisprudence that provides a legal basis for the Panel to draw inferences from the best information available in the record in order to comply with the requirements of Article 11 of the DSU.466 For example, in the US ­ Wheat Gluten case, the panel requested that the United States supply it with certain information that had been redacted from the public version of a USITC Report, but despite several requests, the United States refused to submit the information.467 The panel decided that while having access to all the requested information from the United States would have furnished a more extensive basis for its examination and have facilitated an objective assessment of the facts, there were other facts of record that the panel was required to include in its "objective assessment".468 Ultimately, the panel determined that the United States violated provisions of the Agreement on Safeguards on the basis of the available factual record.469 When the
program ­ that "[d]eficiency payments are entitlements; that is, spending is determined by rules that define eligibility and govern benefit levels rather than by the annual appropriations process. USDA and Congress have no control over deficiency payment outlays." (Exhibit Bra-417 ("Commodity Program Entitlements: Deficiency Payments", USDA, May 1993).
461 US 22 December 2003 Answers to Questions, para. 182. 462 In the context of the peace clause arguments, the United States argued that it could not control the amount of budgetary outlays under the programmes. 463 Brazil's 20 January 2004 Answers to Additional Questions, paras. 18-22 (with further references). 464 Brazil's 28 January 2004 Comments and Requests Regarding US Data, Section 6. 465 See also Brazil's 28 January 2004 Comments and Requests Regarding US Data, Section 11. 466 Brazil's 9 October 2003 Closing Statement, paras. 2, 9 (citing Panel Report, Argentina ­ Textiles and Apparel, WT/DS56/R, para. 6.39). 467 Appellate Body Report, US ­ Wheat Gluten, WT/DS166/AB/R, para. 168. 468 Panel Report, US ­ Wheat Gluten, WT/DS166/R, para. 8.12. 469 Panel Report, US ­ Wheat Gluten, WT/DS166/R, para. 8.12.

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-543
United States appealed this decision, the Appellate Body affirmed the panel, stating that "where a party refuses to provide information requested by a panel, that refusal will be one of the relevant facts of record, and indeed, an important fact, to be taken into account in determining the appropriate inference to be drawn".470 The Appellate Body further indicated that it "deplored the conduct of the United States" in refusing to cooperate and provide information that was within its exclusive control.471
234. Another example of a panel using the best information available when a Member refused to provide documents within its exclusive control is the Argentina ­ Textiles and Apparel case. In that case, the United States requested Argentina to produce complete original customs documents of all footwear imports to demonstrate that Argentina was imposing and requiring payment of specific duties in excess of its bound duty rates of 35 per cent ad valorem.472 Argentina refused to provide the complete (or any) documents.473 The United States then provided examples of customs documents, which Argentina contested on a variety of authenticity and relevance grounds.474 The panel rejected these Argentine arguments and found that "the United States has provided sufficient evidence".475 In so holding, the panel noted that "[i]n situations where direct evidence is not available, relying on inferences drawn from relevant facts of each case facilitates the duty of international tribunals in determining whether or not the burden of proof has been met".476 The panel further held that there is a requirement for collaboration of the parties in the presentation of the facts and evidence to the panel, and emphasized especially the role of the respondent in that process.477
235. Applying these concepts to the allocation issues involved in the peace clause portion of this dispute indicates that the Panel has more than sufficient evidence in the record to support a reasonable estimate of the amount of contract payment support provided to upland cotton in MY 1999-2002.478 Brazil detailed its views concerning the appropriate allocation methodology for purposes of the peace clause.479 Faced with the US refusal to provide the data necessary to calculate the precise amount of support to upland cotton from the US contract payments using Brazil's (and the US) allocation methodology, Brazil offered extensive circumstantial evidence in support of its alternative so-called "14/16th methodology".480 The Panel may properly draw adverse inferences that the United States data would, if produced, have shown that Brazil's 14/16th methodology undercounted the amount of support to upland cotton.481 Such an adverse inference supports the other extensive evidence that the 14/16th methodology provides a reasonable estimate.482

As demonstrated by Brazil, the peace clause is in the nature of an affirmative defense. And even if the Panel were to disagree, Brazil established a prima facie case of inconsistency of the US measures with Article 13(b)(ii) of the Agreement on Agriculture. Neither the claim nor the measures to which it relates are outside the Panel's terms of reference, within the meaning of the Appellate Body decision in Japan ­ Agricultural Products, paras. 129-130. 479 Brazil's 20 January 2004 Answers to Additional Questions, paras. 43-55. 480 These facts are summarized in Annex 1 to Brazil's 9 October 2003 Closing Statement, but are also contained in a number of Brazil's earlier submissions to the Panel, beginning with its 24 June 2003 First Submission. See also Brazil's 18 November 2003 Further Rebuttal Submission, Sections 2.1 and 2.4; Brazil's 2 December 2003 Oral Statement, Sections 5.1 and 5.3. 481 Brazil's 28 January 2004 Comments and Requests Regarding US Data, Section 6. 482 Brazil's 28 January 2004 Comments and Requests Regarding US Data, Section 6.

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-544
236. Turning to its claims of serious prejudice and threat thereof, Brazil remains of the firm view that neither Part III of the SCM Agreement nor GATT Article XVI requires an exact determination of the amount of subsidies involved.483 Rather, Brazil must demonstrate their effects.484 Nevertheless, and as an alternative legal argument, Brazil presented extensive evidence concerning the amounts as well as the effects of each challenged subsidy. This is the same evidence Brazil used to demonstrate the amount of support to upland cotton.
237. The United States asserts that Brazil has to allocate all contract payments received by an upland cotton producing farm over the total value of that farm's sales.485 However, even though the United States alone is in exclusive control of the information that would permit such an allocation, it has refused to produce that information. Even if it would be Brazil's burden to establish this fact, the United States has done everything to frustrate Brazil's ability to do so. In particular, the United States first wrongly asserted that data on plantings of farms was not available to it and ­ after Brazil demonstrated that this was incorrect486 ­ refused to produce the evidence.487
238. Indeed, even if the Panel were of the view that the US allocation methodology would provide the best means of evaluating the amount of support to upland cotton, the refusal of the United States to produce the requested data prevents the Panel from applying that methodology. In the face of this lack of cooperation, the Panel is required to apply some other methodology to estimate the amount of contract payment support, i.e., Brazil's 14/16th methodology, or some variant thereof. To hold otherwise would obviously penalize Brazil, who sought the information, inter alia, for the purpose of demonstrating that the US methodology would reveal amounts of support similar to those estimated by Brazil's own 14/16th methodology.
239. It is ironic that among the evidence that supports Brazil's 14/16th methodology is the incomplete summary data provided by the United States. Brazil attempted to use that data to perform a simplified version of the (improper) US allocation methodology.488 Brazil does not believe, as the Panel's question suggests, that it can make reasonable assumptions using this methodology based on the fragmented summary data provided by the United States. Nevertheless, although Brazil cautions against the use of its results, and although this methodology is not relevant for purposes of the peace clause, Brazil notes that these results are only marginally smaller than the results of Brazil's own 14/16th methodology.489
240. Thus, contrary to the US 22 December 2003 arguments490, there is evidence provided by Brazil in the record on which the Panel can rely in making an objective assessment of the facts and in deciding on Brazil's claims under Part III of the SCM Agreement and GATT Article XVI (as well as under Article 13(b)(ii) of the Agreement on Agriculture). Brazil has also met its burden of proof in establishing a prima facie case concerning its claims of inconsistency of the US measures with these provisions.

IX. ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS POSED ON 23 DECEMBER 2003 AND 12 JANUARY 2004
257. The Panel takes note of the Appellate Body Report in United States ­ Sunset Review of Anti-Dumping Duties on Corrosion-Resistant Carbon Steel Flat Products from Japan (DS244), which was circulated to WTO Members on 15 December 2003. The Panel is aware that this report has yet to be adopted by the Dispute Settlement Body. Nevertheless, the Panel asks the parties to respond to the following related questions.
(a) In tht report, the Appellate Body cautioned against the "mechanistic" application of the so-called "mandatory/discretionary distinction" and stated that the import of this distinction may vary from case to case (para. 93). For the Appellate Body, the question of whether a measure is mandatory or not is relevant "if at all" only as part of the assessment of whether the measure is, as such, inconsistent with particular obligations. How, if at all, are these statements and the related findings concerning the mandatory/discretionary distinction in that Appellate Body Report relevant to:
(i) the legal standard and elements Brazil sets out to establish its export and prohibited subsidy claims under the provisions of the Agreement on Agriculture and Articles 3.1(a) and (b) of the SCM Agreement, concerning: BRA
- Step 2 payments (see, e.g. paras. 244-245 & 250 Brazil's first written submission; Panel Question 109 and parties' responses/comments thereon); and
- export credit guarantee programmes: GSM-102, GSM-103 and SCGP (see, e.g., para. 90 Brazil's oral statement at second Panel meeting).
(ii) the legal standard and elements Brazil sets out to establish its serious prejudice and "threat of serious prejudice" claims, and in particular, its designation of marketing loan; crop insurance; counter-cyclical payments; direct payments and Step 2 as "mandatory"? BRA
(iii) the legal standard and elements Brazil sets out to establish its "per se" "serious prejudice" claims (e.g. Brazil's 9 September further submission, para. 417 ff; US oral statement at second Panel meeting, para. 86 ff.)? BRA
(b) How and to what extent are the legal and regulatory provisions cited in paras. 415 and 423 of Brazil's 9 September further submission "normative" in nature and treated as binding within the US legal system (see, e.g., para. 99 of the Appellate Body Report)? Does your response differ depending on whether the payments are dependent upon market price conditions? BRA
(c) Does Brazil challenge as "mandatory" the "subsidies" themselves, the subsidy programmes or the legal/regulatory provisions for the grant or maintenance of those subsidies, or something else? BRA
(d) Does the "requirement" upon the CCC to make available "not less than" $5.5 billion annually in guarantees have a normative character and operation? (see, e.g. Brazil's response to Panel Question 142; Exhibit BRA-297, 7 USC 5641(b)(1); 7 USC 5622(a) & (b); paragraph 201 of US 18 November further rebuttal submissions). Is this requirement "mandatory"? If so, how does the CCC have "discretion" not to make this amount of guarantees available in a given year? USA

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-546
(e) Does the US agree that, under the Budget Enforcement Act of 1990, the Office of Management and Budget classifies the export credit guarantee programmes as "mandatory" (see Brazil's response to Panel Question 142, para. 89)? Does this exempt the programmes from the requirement to receive new Congressional budget authority before it undertakes new guarantee commitments (e.g. Exhibit BRA-117 (2 USC 661(c)(2))? USA
Brazil's Comment:
241. Brazil makes several observations with respect to the United States' 20 January 2004 responses to Questions 257(d) and 257(e).
242. First, the evidence discussed in the Panel's questions and the US responses is only relevant to a determination whether the United States is in compliance with Article 10.1 of the Agreement on Agriculture with respect to scheduled products. For unscheduled products, the Appellate Body held that it is inconsistent with Article 10.1 to provide any export subsidies.491 Brazil has demonstrated that CCC guarantees were extended for unscheduled products during the period 1992-2003. Having also demonstrated that the CCC programmes constitute export subsidies (under Articles 1.1 and 3.1(a) of the SCM Agreement, and under item (j)), Brazil has therefore established that the United States has circumvented its export subsidy commitments with respect to unscheduled products, in violation of Article 10.1. Brazil has also demonstrated that CCC guarantees continue to be available for unscheduled products.492 Since it is inconsistent with Article 10.1 to provide any export subsidies, the availability of CCC guarantees leads to a threat of circumvention of the US export subsidy commitments.
243. Second, the test to determine whether the United States is threatening to circumvent its export subsidy commitments with respect to scheduled products is not whether the CCC guarantee programmes are "mandatory" as opposed to "discretionary."493 Rather, to determine whether export subsidies result in, or threaten to lead to, circumvention of the United States' export subsidy commitments, the test set out by the Appellate Body in US ­ FSC is whether there is a "mechanism in the measure" for CCC to "stem[], or otherwise control[], the flow of" CCC export credit guarantees.494
244. Under this test, the threat of circumvention is not abated simply because, as the United States notes, the CCC is not actually required to issue the "not less than $5,500,000,000 in credit guarantees" that it must, as a matter of law, make available every year.495 The threat arises because, year-on-year, the CCC announces its plans to extend over $6 billion in guarantees, as it did for fiscal year 2004.496

For 1999-2002, see also Exhibit Bra-73 ("Summary of Export Credit Guarantee Program Activity," USDA, covering GSM 102, GSM 103 and SCGP for US fiscal years 19992003). For 1992-1998, see Exhibit US-41. 493 The Panel will recall that in addition to its threat of circumvention claims with respect to scheduled products, Brazil has also demonstrated that the United States has used the CCC guarantee programs to circumvent its export subsidy commitments with respect to rice (a scheduled product).

It is required to do so by law.497 It is, moreover, altogether exempt from any ceiling on the amount of guarantees it extends, and from the normal requirement that it receive new budget authority before undertaking new guarantee commitments (the programmes' "mandatory" status under US law "does not effectively constrain credit activity").498 The CCC uses that exemption liberally, increasing allocations throughout the fiscal year to meet the needs of US exporters.499
245. Even if the CCC does not reach its goal of issuing over $6 billion in guarantees by year end, the fact that US law tells it that it must make available at least this amount, the fact that it sets its sights on and actually announces this amount, and the fact that nothing in US law sets any upward bound on the amount of guarantees it can issue, communicates a threat that it will circumvent its export subsidy commitments. Even if the CCC does not reach its goal of issuing $6 billion in export credit guarantees, foreign competitors of US farmers see that it has announced its intent to do so, that it has the authority to do that and an unlimited amount more, and that there is no "mechanism in the measure" for CCC to "stem[], or otherwise control[], the flow of" CCC export credit guarantees.500
246. Moreover, foreign competitors of US farmers have seen how, as an historical matter, the United States has applied the CCC guarantee programmes to surpass its quantitative export subsidy reduction commitments ­ even when falling short of its announced intent to issue $6 billion in guarantees. Brazil has demonstrated how this threat materialized for one product ­ rice ­ in fiscal years 2001, 2002 and 2003 (despite the fact that the CCC did not reach its announced intent of handing out $6 billion in guarantees in any of those years).501 Foreign producers' fears that the threat will materialize in other years for other products are legitimate, and the threat is therefore tangible (regardless whether or not the CCC meets its goal of handing out $6 billion in guarantees in any given year).
247. Merely having what the United States claims is the unwritten, administrative discretion to "tamp down the actual issuance of guarantees" would not be enough under this test.502 The reason the Appellate Body in US ­ FSC looked for an affirmative "mechanism in the measure" subject to an Article 10.1 claim that would stem or control the flow of subsidies, rather than merely accepting as sufficient the unwritten administrative discretion to do so, is that only when such a mechanism exists, will foreign competitors of US farmers know with a degree of assurance that the threat of

circumvention is not real. The purpose of the mechanism, in other words, is to diminish the threat. (Had this not been the Appellate Body's intent, it would simply have stuck to the traditional mandatory/discretionary formula it has used elsewhere and that the United States asserts applies in the analysis of an Article 10.1 claim.)
248. In any event, the "discretionary elements" that the United States asserts503 abate the threat posed by its annual announcement that it will issue over $6 billion in CCC export credit guarantees are an illusion, for at least two reasons.504
249. First, the United States has offered no evidence that the CCC may reject "any individual application"505 (much less that there is a "mechanism" to do so in order to avoid circumvention of US export subsidy commitments). As Brazil has previously noted, the CCC guarantee programmes are classified as "mandatory" under US law.506 The Congressional Budget Office ("CBO") and the Congressional Research Service ("CRS") (legislative branch agencies charged with servicing the US Congress) have both noted the inability of executive branch agencies charged with implementing mandatory programmes to deny support to eligible borrowers.507 The United States cites a nonprogramme specific document for a generic principle that mandatory and discretionary classifications under the Budget and Enforcement Act "`do not determine whether a programme provides legal entitlement to a payment or benefit'".508 Speaking specifically with respect to USDA mandatory programmes, however, the CRS states that "`[e]ligibility for mandatory programmes is written into law, and any individual or entity that meets the eligibility requirements is entitled to a payment as authorized by the law'".509
503 US 20 January 2004 Answers to Additional Questions, para. 3. 504 Brazil has elsewhere explained the CCC's authority to undertake an inquiry into whether particular countries are creditworthy, and the possibility that this inquiry could end up reducing the amount of CCC guarantees, does not prevent a conclusion that nothing "stem[s], or otherwise control[s], the flow of" CCC guarantees. Brazil's 27 October 2003 Answers to Questions, para. 92. Under the United States' FSC measure, US authorities were permitted to undertake a factual inquiry into, among other things, whether the foreignsource income of the foreign corporation was "effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the United States." Appellate Body Report, US ­ FSC, WT/DS108/AB/R, para. 16. This authority, and the possibility that the factual inquiry could limit the amount of income that would qualify for the FSC exemption, did not prevent the Appellate Body from concluding that nothing in the FSC measure "stem[ed], or otherwise control[led], the flow of" FSC benefits, leading to a threat of circumvention of the United States' export subsidy reduction commitments. 505 US 20 January 2004 Answers to Additional Questions, para. 3. The United States has not offered any support for its assertion that CCC has the authority "to suspend the issuance of expert credit guarantees under any particular allocation". In any event, Brazil demonstrates infra that the allocation process does not remotely abate the threat that the United States will circumvent its quantitative export subsidy reduction commitments. 506 Exhibit Bra-295 (2004 US Budget, Federal Credit Supplement, Introduction and Table 2 (CCC Export Loan Guarantee Program classified as "Mandatory" in Table 2, and in the "Introduction", the Office of Management and Budget states that Table 2 provides "the programme's BEA classification under the Budget Enforcement Act (BEA) of 1990 as discretionary or mandatory"). 507 See Exhibit Bra-117 (2 U.S.C. § 661(c)(2)); Exhibit Bra-185 (Congressional Budget Office Staff Memorandum, "An Explanation of the Budgetary Changes under Credit Reform," April 1991, p. 7 and Table 2); Exhibit Bra-186 (Congressional Research Service Issue Brief for Congress, "Agriculture and the Budget," IB95031 (16 February 1996), p. 3). 508 US 20 January 2004 Answers to Additional Questions, para. 7. 509 Exhibit Bra-186 (Congressional Research Service Issue Brief for Congress, "Agriculture and the Budget," IB95031 (16 February 1996), p. 3). The United States made a similar error in its 30 September 2003 Further Submission, at paragraph 156, when it cited the very same generic, non-agency-specific document (Circular A-11) for the principle that "the ability of CCC to issue guarantees is constrained by the apportionment process . . ." As Brazil has demonstrated, the CCC programs are exempt from the requirement that to receive new Congressional budget authority before undertaking new guarantee commitments. See Exhibit Bra-117 (2 U.S.C. § 661(c)(2)).

250. Second, the "discretionary elements" cited by the United States do not in any way abate the threat that the United States will circumvent its export subsidy commitments for scheduled products:
· The existence of eligibility criteria does not abate the threat. The focus for deciding whether a measure is discretionary is on whether it provides government officials with the discretion to implement the measure in a WTO-consistent manner.510 Objective conditions, such as objective eligibility criteria, are not appropriately considered in determining whether a measure gives an implementing official "discretion" to act in a WTO-consistent fashion. For example, the FSC measure payments were only available where the income concerned was of foreign origin. Despite the fact that non-foreign sourced income would thus be excluded from FSC benefits, the measure was still found to threaten the circumvention of export subsidy commitments. Similarly, CCC guarantees are only available if an exporter meets the eligibility criteria set out in 7 C.F.R. § 1493.30.511 The fact that a CCC official cannot legally issue a CCC guarantee to a non-eligible exporter does not make the CCC programmes "discretionary".
· The authority to limit guarantees given for exports to particular "destination[s]" and the authority to employ "exposure limits applicable to individual bank obligors"512, like the authority to determine that particular destination countries are uncreditworthy and are ineligible for guarantees513, do not reduce the threat of circumvention. The United States' export subsidy commitments are undertaken on a quantitative basis, and not on a destination or individual bank basis. Removing particular destination countries or banks from the list of those countries or banks eligible for CCC guarantees is utterly irrelevant to the CCC programmes' absolute activity levels ­ CCC can simply shift those guarantees to other countries and banks.
· Nor does the authority to limit the "time within which export must occur"514 reduce the threat of circumvention. A requirement that the export that is the subject of a guarantee occur within a certain period of time following issuance of the guarantee only matters if the guarantee is issued in the first place; the requirement does nothing to control the flow of those guarantees or to abate the threat that they will circumvent the US export subsidy commitments.
· Nor does the allegedly commodity-specific allocation process that the United States cites515 reduce the threat of circumvention. More than 95 per cent of allocations are made on a country-specific basis only, with less than 5 per cent of 2003 allocations made on a scheduled product-specific basis.516 And the press release announcing initial allocations for 2004 contains no product-specific allocations.517 More importantly, the allocations are made on a monetary basis, which provides virtually no assurance that the United States will not surpass

See also US 30 September 2003 Further Submission, para. 155. 516 See Brazil's 27 October Answers to Questions, para. 99, note 136 and Exhibit Bra-299 ("Summary of FY 2003 Export Credit Guarantee Programme Activity," USDA, covering GSM-102, GSM-103 and SCGP (Total GSM 102, GSM 103 and SCGP allocations for fiscal year 2003 are listed as $6.025 billion, with productspecific allocations for scheduled products as follows: $200 million for wheat to Korea; $85 million for wheat to Pakistan; and, $10 million for vegetable oils for Tunisia.). See also Brazil's 18 November 2003 Further Rebuttal Submission, para. 261 (second bullet point). 517 Exhibit Bra-296 ("USDA Announces $2.8 Billion in Export Credit Guarantees," FAS Press Release, 30 September 2003).

its quantitative export subsidy reduction commitments.518 Brazil has demonstrated how this threat materialized for one product (rice)519; the threat that it might happen in some years for other products is therefore tangible.
251. Thus the "discretionary elements" cited by the United States do not abate the threat of circumvention of its export subsidy commitments. The United States erroneously states that "Brazil's own approach would require a showing that the programmes mandate that the premium rates will be insufficient to cover long-term operating costs and losses of the programmes".520 The Panel will recall Brazil's demonstration that the United States has exported quantities of scheduled products in excess of US quantitative reduction commitments.521 Thus, under Article 10.3 of the Agreement on Agriculture, the burden falls on the United States to prove that those excess quantities of scheduled products did not receive "export subsidies," within the meaning of Article 10.1. The burden is on the United States to show, in its own words, that the CCC programmes mandate that premium rates will be sufficient to cover long-term operating costs and losses of the programmes, within the meaning of item (j), and that CCC guarantees do not constitute financial contributions that confer benefits and are contingent on export, with the meaning of Articles 1.1 and 3.1(a) of the SCM Agreement.
252. But whomever bears the burden, Brazil has shown that the CCC does not have the discretion to charge fees that will enable it to meet its long-term operating costs and losses. Both USDA's Inspector General and the US General Accounting Office have noted the CCC's failure to change its premium rates or to reflect credit risk in those rates ­ and in particular the maximum one-per cent premium rate imposed by US law522 ­ as evidence of a failure and inability to cover costs and losses.523 There is no affirmative "mechanism" in place to stop the CCC programmes from constituting export subsidies under item (j), and in fact the fee ceiling imposed by US law is a mechanism that ensures that the programmes will operate as export subsidies.
253. Moreover, Brazil has demonstrated that the CCC export credit guarantee programmes confer "benefits" per se, within the meaning of Article 1.1(b) of the SCM Agreement (as well as that they are financial contributions and are contingent on export), and therefore that they constitute per se export subsidies for the purposes of Article 10.1.524 Among other reasons (e.g., the regulations for the CCC programmes, and a comparison to non-market benchmarks established by the US Export-Import Bank)525, Brazil has made this per se showing by demonstrating that CCC export credit guarantees are unique financing instruments for agricultural commodity transactions that are not available on the commercial market for terms longer than the marketing cycles of the eligible commodities.526 Far from an affirmative "mechanism" to prevent CCC guarantees from constituting export subsidies, guarantees under the CCC programmes constitute export subsidies per se.

254. Everything about the CCC programmes aggravates and legitimizes the fear foreign competitors of US farmers have that the programmes will be used to circumvent the United States' export subsidy commitments. Brazil has demonstrated that under Articles 1.1 and 3.1(a) of the SCM Agreement, and item (j), guarantees under the programmes constitute per se export subsidies. The CCC issues these export subsidies free from the normal budgetary constraints placed on federal spending. The only constraint placed on the programmes is one that in fact encourages fear of circumvention ­ the obligation the US Congress has placed on the CCC to make available a minimum of $6.5 billion of CCC guarantees every year.527 While the United States considers CCC's failure to actually grant $6.5 billion in guarantees in a given year as significant to its defense, it misunderstands the obligation included in Article 10.1. Article 10.1 prohibits the threat of circumvention. Foreign competitors of US farmers see and fear the unchecked authority US farmers and the CCC have to circumvent US export subsidy commitments. Their fear is legitimate, since that unchecked authority has been used in the past to circumvent those commitments.528 255. There is no affirmative "mechanism in the measure" that will stem or control the flow of CCC guarantees in a way that will abate the threat of circumvention of the US export subsidy commitments with respect to scheduled products. To abate the fear that makes the threat real, foreign competitors need to see a mechanism in place that will keep the United States from using the CCC programmes to provide export subsidies that surpass the US reduction commitments. The nature of the obligation in Article 10.1 ­ the prohibition of a threat ­ is such that it cannot be met with a showing that there is mere discretion to avoid surpassing those commitments. That the Appellate Body failed to apply the traditional mandatory/discretionary distinction in interpreting the standard required by Article 10.1 demonstrates its understanding that to prevent a measure from posing a threat of circumvention, there needs to be some affirmative mechanism in place to reduce the legitimate fear of circumvention. 258.
