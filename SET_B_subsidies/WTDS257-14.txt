Status Report Regarding Implementation of the DSB Recommendations and Rulings in the Dispute United States ­ Final Countervailing Duty Determination with Respect to Certain Softwood Lumber from Canada
(WT/DS257)
The United States submits this report in accordance with Article 21.6 of the Understanding on Rules and Procedures Governing the Settlement of Disputes.
On 17 February 2004, the Dispute Settlement Body ("DSB") adopted its recommendations and rulings in United States ­ Final Countervailing Duty Determination with Respect to Certain Softwood Lumber from Canada (WT/DS257). By letter of 5 March 2004, the United States informed the DSB of its intention to implement those recommendations and rulings, and advised the DSB that a "reasonable period of time" would be required to do this. On 28 April 2004, the United States and Canada informed the DSB that they had agreed that the reasonable period of time would be ten months, that is, from 17 February 2004 to 17 December 2004.
Since that time, the US Department of Commerce has been collecting and analysing information relevant to the recommendations and rulings of the DSB in its countervailing duty investigation of softwood lumber products from Canada, and, on the basis of that information, intends to issue a determination in that investigation in the near future.
