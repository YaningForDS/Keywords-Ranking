MEXICO ­ DEFINITIVE ANTI-DUMPING MEASURES ON BEEF AND RICE
Complaint with Respect to Rice
Notification of an Appeal by Mexico under Article 16.4 and Article 17 of the Understanding on Rules and Procedures Governing the Settlement of Disputes (DSU) and Rule 20.1 of the Working Procedures for Appellate Review

The following notification dated 20 July 2005 from the delegation of Mexico is circulated to Members.
_______________

Pursuant to Article 16 of the Understanding on Rules and Procedures Governing the Settlement of Disputes (DSU) and Rule 20 of the Working Procedures for Appellate Review, Mexico wishes to notify its decision to appeal certain points of law covered in the final report of the Panel that examined the case Mexico ­ Definitive Anti-Dumping Measures on Beef and Rice (WT/DS295/R) and the corresponding legal interpretations, as outlined below.
1. Mexico seeks review by the Appellate Body of the Panel's finding that the request for establishment of a panel presented by the United States was not inconsistent with Article 6.2 of the DSU. This finding is based on points of law and erroneous legal interpretations, such as extension of the legal basis of the complaint1 through acceptance that the panel request should include 13 legal provisions that did not appear in the request for consultations.
2. Mexico seeks review by the Appellate Body of the Panel's findings and conclusions that Mexico's Ministry of the Economy acted inconsistently with Article 3.1, 3.2, 3.4 and 3.5 of the Agreement on Implementation of Article VI of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994 (AD Agreement) in issuing its determination of injury in the anti-dumping investigation on imports of long-grain white rice from the United States. Mexico holds that these findings and conclusions, as set forth below, lie outside the context established by the terms of reference applicable to this dispute, are in error and are based on misinterpretations of the cited Articles of the AD Agreement and of various Appellate Body reports (some of which were not considered at all although Mexico cited them in its written submissions):
(a) The findings in paragraphs 7.50 to 7.65 of the final report of the Panel and the conclusion in paragraph 8.1(a) of the report, in which the Panel erred in determining that Mexico acted inconsistently with Article 3.1, 3.2, 3.4 and 3.5 of the AD Agreement by basing its injury determination on a period of investigation which had ended more than 15 months before the initiation of the investigation.

(c) The findings in paragraphs 7.89 and 7.117 of the final report of the Panel and the conclusion in paragraph 8.1(c) of the report, in which the Panel erred in determining that Mexico acted inconsistently with Article 3.1 and 3.2 of the AD Agreement by failing to conduct an objective examination based on positive evidence of the price effects and volume of dumped imports as part of its injury analysis.
