JAPAN ­ COUNTERVAILING DUTIES ON DYNAMIC RANDOM ACCESS MEMORIES FROM KOREA
Appellate Body Report
Corrigendum
On page 39, paragraph 112, insert the word "not" between the words "was" and "inconsistent". Paragraph 112 of the Appellate Body Report, in the Section summarizing the arguments of Third Participants, should therefore read as follows: "The United States argues that the JIA's calculation of the benefit from the debt-to-equity swap was not inconsistent with Article 14(a) of the SCM Agreement."
