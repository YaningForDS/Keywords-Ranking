Request to Join Consultations
Communication from the United States
The following communication, dated 12 March 2007, from the delegation of the United States to the delegation of China, the delegation of Mexico and to the Chairman of the Dispute Settlement Body, is circulated in accordance with Article 4.11 of the DSU.
_______________
This concerns the request for consultations by Mexico on China ­ Certain Measures Granting Refunds, Reductions or Exemptions from Taxes and Other Payments, circulated on 28 February 2007 (WT/DS359/1). My authorities have instructed me to notify the consulting Members and the Dispute Settlement Body of the desire of the United States to be joined in these consultations, pursuant to Article 4.11 of the Understanding on Rules and Procedures Governing the Settlement of Disputes. The United States has a substantial trade interest in these consultations. They concern certain measures of China granting refunds, reductions or exemptions from taxes or other payments otherwise due by enterprises in China, measures on which the United States has also requested consultations (WT/DS358/1). These measures appear to offer import substitution and export subsidies across a broad range of manufacturing sectors affecting the conditions of competition facing US manufactured goods sold in the US and foreign markets.
