BRAZIL - EXPORT FINANCING PROGRAMME FOR AIRCRAFT
Communication from Brazil
The following communication, dated 13 September 1999, from the Permanent Mission of Brazil to the Dispute Settlement Body, is circulated at the request of Brazil.
_______________
I would like to make reference to Article 4.9 of the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures and Article 21.3 of the DSU, and to Brazil's obligation to inform the Dispute Settlement Body of its intentions in respect of implementation of the DSB's recommendations concerning the case "Brazil - Export Financing Programme for Aircraft".
I would also like to make reference to the agreement reached with Canada, during the 20 August 1999 meeting of the DSB in which the Panel and Appellate Body Reports regarding the above-mentioned case were adopted (see documents WT/DS46/AB/R and WT/DS46/R), and which was accepted by the DSB, that the obligation under Article 21.3 would be fulfilled in writing.
My authorities have instructed me to inform you that Brazil intends to comply with the recommendations of the DSB with regard to this matter.
