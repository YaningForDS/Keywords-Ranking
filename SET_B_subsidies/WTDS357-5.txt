UNITED STATES ­ SUBSIDIES AND OTHER DOMESTIC SUPPORT FOR CORN AND OTHER AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS
Request to Join Consultations
Communication from Argentina
The following communication, dated 19 January 2007, from the delegation of Argentina to the delegation of the United States, the delegation of Canada and to the Chairman of the Dispute Settlement Body, is circulated in accordance with Article 4.11 of the DSU.
_______________
I hereby refer to the request for consultations by Canada to the United States of America concerning subsidies and other domestic support for corn and other agricultural products, contained in document WT/DS357/1, G/L/812, G/SCM/D73/1, G/AG/GEN/74, dated 11 January 2007.
My country is the world's second largest exporter of corn and one of the major world producers of agricultural products. In 2005 Argentina exported $1.4 billion worth of corn, and is the only country aside from the United States with a significant share of the world export market accounting for around 15 % of the world trade during the period 2003-2006.
As a major agricultural producer and exporter, Argentina is very concerned about the effects that subsidies and/or any other forms of domestic support provided by the United States to their producers and/or exporters of corn and other agricultural products, have on its own production and/or exports of the subject product.
In view of its substantial trade interest as a producer and exporter of corn and other agricultural products, the Argentine Republic request to be joined in the aforementioned consultations pursuant to the procedures established in Article 4 11 of the Understanding on Rules and Procedures Governing the Settlement of Disputes (DSU)
I would be grateful for receiving a positive answer to the request contained herein, and to be informed of the date and venue of the consultations.
