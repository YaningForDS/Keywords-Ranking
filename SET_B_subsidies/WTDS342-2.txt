CHINA ­ MEASURES AFFECTING IMPORTS OF AUTOMOBILE PARTS
Request to Join Consultations
Communication from the United States
The following communication, dated 25 April 2006, from the delegation of the United States to the delegation of China, the delegation of Canada and to the Chairman of the Dispute Settlement Body, is circulated in accordance with Article 4.11 of the DSU.
_______________
This concerns the request for consultations by Canada on China ­ Measures Affecting Imports of Automobile Parts, circulated on 19 April 2006 (WT/DS342/1). My authorities have instructed me to notify the consulting Members and the Dispute Settlement Body of the desire of the United States to be joined in these consultations, pursuant to Article 4.11 of the Understanding on Rules and Procedures Governing the Settlement of Disputes. The United States has a substantial trade interest in these consultations. They concern China's measures governing the treatment of imported motor vehicle parts, components, and accessories ("auto parts"), on which the United States has also requested consultations (WT/DS340/1). These measures appear to penalize manufacturers for using imported auto parts ­ including those from the United States ­ in the manufacture of vehicles for sale in China.
