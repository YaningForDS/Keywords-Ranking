Request to Join Consultations
Communication from the European Communities
The following communication, dated 29 March 2006, from the delegation of the European Communities to the delegation of Japan, the delegation of Korea and to the Chairman of the Dispute Settlement Body, is circulated in accordance with Article 4.11 of the DSU.
_______________
Pursuant to Article 4.11 of the Understanding on Rules and Procedures Governing the Settlement of Disputes (DSU), the European Communities hereby notifies the Governments of Japan, Korea and the Dispute Settlement Body that, in the light of the substantial trade interest of the European Communities, it desires to be joined in the consultations requested by Korea in a communication circulated to WTO Members on 20 March 2006 (WT/DS336/1, G/L/765, G/SCM/D65/1) entitled Japan ­ Countervailing Duties on Dynamic Random Access Memories from Korea.
A substantial part of imports of DRAMs into the European Communities originates in Korea, and on 23 August 2003, the European Communities also imposed a duty on imports of Dynamic Random Access Memories ("DRAMs") from Korea to countervail the subsidies granted by Korea to its DRAMs producers. This measure was also subject to a dispute between Korea and the European Communities (WT/DS299). The European Communities has therefore a substantial trade interest in the present dispute and in the correct application of the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures.
