The following communication, dated 13 April 2006, from the delegation of Mexico to the delegation of China, the delegation of the European Communities and to the Chairman of the Dispute Settlement Body, is circulated in accordance with Article 4.11 of the DSU.
_______________
My authorities have instructed me to request, pursuant to Article 4.11 of the WTO Understanding on Rules and Procedures Governing the Settlement of Disputes, that Mexico be joined in the consultations requested by the European Communities on 30 March 2006 in a communication circulated to Members on 3 April 2006 which identifies as the subject of the requested consultations "China's imposition of measures that adversely affect exports of automobile parts from the European Communities to China".
As a producer of automobile parts, Mexico has a substantial trade interest in this case, and would be most grateful if its request were given due consideration.
