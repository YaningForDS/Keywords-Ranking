Request to Join Consultations
Communication from Thailand
The following communication, dated 27 July 2007, from the delegation of Thailand to the delegation of the United States, the delegation of Brazil and to the Chairman of the Dispute Settlement Body, is circulated in accordance with Article 4.11 of the DSU.
_______________
Pursuant to paragraph 11 of Article 4 of the Understanding on Rules and Procedures Governing the Settlement of Disputes (DSU), Thailand hereby notifies the consulting parties and the Dispute Settlement Body of its desire to be joined in the consultations requested by Brazil in a communication circulated to WTO Members on 17 July 2007 (WT/DS365/1).
As a developing country exporter of agricultural products, many of which are affected by the measures identified by Brazil in its request for consultations, Thailand has a substantial and systemic interest in the subject of Brazil's request. Hence, Thailand requests to be joined in the consultations requested by Brazil.
I look forward to receiving confirmation of receipt and acceptance of this request as well as advice regarding the timing and venue for these consultations.
