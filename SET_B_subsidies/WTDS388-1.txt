B. The measures listed in Section A above appear to provide enterprises in China with grants, loans, and other incentives contingent upon export performance. Accordingly, the measures appear to be inconsistent with Article 3 of the SCM Agreement. Additionally, to the extent that these measures provide subsidies for agricultural products, they appear to be inconsistent with Articles 3, 9, and 10 of the Agreement on Agriculture. The measures also appear to be inconsistent with the PRC's obligations under paragraph 12.1 of Part I of its Accession Protocol108, as well as paragraph 1.2 of Part I of its Accession Protocol (to the extent that it incorporates paragraph 234 of the Report of the Working Party on the Accession of China)109, which forms part of the terms of accession agreed between the PRC and the WTO and is an integral part of the Marrakesh Agreement Establishing the World Trade Organization. Finally, the grants, loans, and other incentives appear to be inconsistent with Article III:4 of the GATT 1994 to the extent that the measures benefit Chinese-origin products and not imported products.

Mexico reserves the right to raise further factual and legal claims during the course of the consultations. It looks forward to receiving the PRC Government's response in order to set a mutually convenient date for consultations.
