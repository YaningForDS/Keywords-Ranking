Request to Join Consultations
Communication from Thailand
The following communication, dated 21 June 2006, from the delegation of Thailand to the delegation of the United States, the delegation of India and to the Chairman of the Dispute Settlement Body, is circulated in accordance with Article 4.11 of the DSU.
_______________
Pursuant to Article 4.11 of the Understanding on Rules and Procedures Governing the Settlement of Disputes (DSU), the Kingdom of Thailand hereby notifies the consulting parties and the Dispute Settlement Body of its desire to be joined in the consultations requested by India in a communication circulated to WTO Members on 12 June 2006 (WT/DS345/1).
As the Kingdom of Thailand has requested consultations with the United States in the dispute currently titled United States ­ Final Anti-Dumping Measures on Shrimp from Thailand, in a communication dated 24 April 2006 and circulated to WTO Members on 27 April 2006 (WT/DS343/1 and WT/DS343/1/Corr.1), on measures similar to those described in India's consultations request, we have both a substantial trade and systemic interest in these proceedings. Hence, the Kingdom of Thailand requests to be joined in the consultations requested by India in this matter.
I look forward to receiving confirmation of receipt and acceptance of this request, and advice regarding the timing and venue for these consultations.
