UNITED STATES ­ MEASURES AFFECTING TRADE IN LARGE CIVIL AIRCRAFT
Communication from Japan
The following communication, dated 30 September 2005, from the delegation of Japan to the Chairman of the Dispute Settlement Body, is circulated at the request of that delegation.
_______________
With regard to the above-mentioned proceeding, I wish to refer to the request for the establishment of a panel by the European Communities (WT/DS317/2), circulated to Members on 3 June 2005. In that communication, the EC also requested the initiation of the information-gathering process under Annex V of the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures (SCM Agreement), and specified its intention to address questions to third-country Members, including Japan, in accordance with the said Annex. The procedures provided in Annex V of the SCM Agreement have been initiated by the DSB at its meeting on 23 September 2005.
Pursuant to paragraph 1 of Annex V, Japan hereby notifies the Dispute Settlement Body that "the organization responsible for administration of this provision within its territory" is the WTO Dispute Settlement Division at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Japan. Japan asks that any request for information be addressed in writing through the dispute settlement officer at the Permanent Mission of Japan to the International Organizations in Geneva.
