CANADA ­ MEASURES RELATING TO THE FEED-IN TARIFF PROGRAM
Request to Join Consultations
Communication from Japan
The following communication, dated 26 August 2011, from the delegation of Japan to the delegation of Canada, the delegation of the European Union and to the Chairperson of the Dispute Settlement Body, is circulated in accordance with Article 4.11 of the DSU.
_______________
I wish to refer to the consultations requested by the European Union in a communication circulated to WTO Members on 16 August 2011 in document WT/DS426/1, G/L/959, G/TRIMS/D/28, G/SCM/D87/1 titled "Canada ­ Measures Relating to the Feed-in Tariff Program". My authorities instruct me to hereby notify the consulting Members and the Dispute Settlement Body of the desire of Japan to be joined in these consultations pursuant to paragraph 11 of Article 4 of the Understanding on Rules and Procedures Governing the Settlement of Dispute.
Japan has a substantial trade interest in these consultations, because they concern the same measures that relate to domestic content requirements in the feed-in tariff program which Japan challenges in the dispute "Canada ­ Certain Measures Affecting the Renewable Energy Generation Sector" (DS412) on a similar legal basis as those set out in the European Union's request for consultations referred to above.
