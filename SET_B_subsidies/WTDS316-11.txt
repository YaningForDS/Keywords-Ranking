Communication from the Chairman of the Panel
The following communication, dated 3 December 2009, addressed to the Chairman of the Dispute Settlement Body (DSB), is circulated in accordance with Article 12.9 of the Dispute Settlement Understanding (DSU).
_______________
Article 12.8 of the DSU provides that the period in which a panel shall conduct its examination, from the date that the composition and terms of reference of the panel have been agreed upon until the date the final report is issued to the parties to the dispute, shall, as a general rule, not exceed six months.
Article 12.9 of the DSU provides that, when a panel considers that it cannot issue its report within six months, it shall inform the DSB in writing of the reasons for the delay, together with an estimate of the period within which it will issue its report.
The Panel on European Communities and Certain Member States ­ Measures Affecting Trade in Large Civil Aircraft (WT/DS316) was established by the DSB on 20 July 2005 and composed on 17 October 2005.
It has not been possible for the Panel to complete its work within the time provided for in Article 12.9 of the DSU, due to, inter alia, the substantive and procedural complexities and the volume of materials involved in this dispute.
The Panel issued its interim report to the parties in September 2009, and is now in the process of finalizing its report. The Panel expects to complete its work before the end of April 2010.
