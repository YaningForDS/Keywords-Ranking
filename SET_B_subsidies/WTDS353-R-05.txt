23. Unless specifically otherwise provided herein, these procedures do not apply to a Party's or Third Party's treatment of its own BCI and HSBI.

IV. DESIGNATION OF APPROVED PERSONS

24. At the latest on 23 February 2007, each Party shall submit to the other Party and Third Parties, and to the Panel, a list of the names and titles of any Representatives and Outside Advisors who need access to BCI submitted by the other Party and/or Third Parties and whom it wishes to have designated as Approved Persons, along with any clerical or support staff that would have access to the BCI. On that list, each Party shall indicate which Approved Persons need access to HSBI submitted by the other Party and/or Third Parties and whom it wishes to have designated as HSBI Approved Persons.

25. There shall be no Third Party HSBI Approved Persons. The designation of Third Party BCI Approved Persons shall be governed by paragraph 32.

26. Each Party shall keep the number of Approved Persons as limited as possible. Each Party may designate no more than a total of 37 Representatives and 20 Outside Advisors as "HSBI Approved Persons".

27. The Panel Members, any PGE members or experts appointed by the Panel in accordance with paragraph 1(d) shall have access to BCI and HSBI. The Director-General of the WTO, or his designee, shall submit to the Parties and Third Parties, and the Panel, a list of the employees of the Secretariat who need access to BCI and/or HSBI.

28. Unless a Party objects to the designation of an Outside Advisor of the other Party or an Employee of the Secretariat, the Panel shall designate those persons as Approved Persons. A Party also may object within ten days of becoming aware of information that was not available to the Party at the time of the filing of a list under paragraphs 24 or 27 that would suggest that designation of an individual is not appropriate. If a Party objects, the Panel shall decide on the objection within ten working days.

29. An objection may be based on the failure to satisfy the definition of "Outside Advisor" or on any other compelling basis, including conflicts of interest.

30. The Parties or the Director-General of the WTO, or his designee, may submit amendments to their lists at any time, subject to the overall limits set out in paragraph 26 and to objections for the addition of new Approved Persons in accordance with paragraph 29.

V. BCI

Third Party BCI Approved Persons may not have access to Party-BCI other than that included in the body of the submissions.4 Approved Persons and Third Party BCI Approved Persons shall use BCI only for the purposes of this dispute. No Approved Person shall disclose BCI, or allow it to be disclosed, to any person except another Approved Person or Third Party BCI Approved Person. No Third Party BCI Approved Person shall disclose BCI, or allow it to be disclosed, to any person except another Approved Person or Third Party BCI Approved Person.

32. Each Third Party that wants to access Party-BCI contained in the first submission of a Party shall submit to the Parties and the other Third Parties, and to the Panel, a list of the names and titles of any Representatives and Outside Advisors (including clerical or support staff) who need access to such BCI and whom it wishes to have designated as Third Party BCI Approved Persons.

A Party also may object within ten days of becoming aware of information that was not available to the Party at the time of the filing of a list under paragraph 32 above that would suggest that designation of an individual is not appropriate. If a Party objects, the Panel shall decide on the objection within ten working days. An objection may be based on the failure to satisfy the definition of "Outside Advisor" or on any other compelling basis, including conflicts of interest.

33. A Party shall make no more than one copy of any BCI submitted by the other Party or a Third Party for each Secure site provided for that Party in paragraph 17.

34. Parties may incorporate BCI in internal memoranda for the exclusive use of Approved Persons. Any memorandum and the BCI it contains shall be marked in accordance with paragraph 4.

35. BCI submitted pursuant to these procedures shall not be copied, distributed, or removed from the Secure site, except as necessary for submission to the Panel.

36. The treatment in a Party's submissions to the Panel of any BCI shall be governed by the provisions of this paragraph, which shall prevail to the extent of any conflict with the other provisions of the Working Procedures (including these Procedures) relating to BCI.

(a) Parties may incorporate BCI in submissions to the Panel, marked as indicated in paragraph 4. In exceptional cases, parties may include BCI in an appendix to a submission.

(b) Unless the Panel informs the Parties otherwise, a Party submitting a submission or appendix containing BCI shall also submit, within a time period to be set by the Panel, a version redacting any BCI. This shall be referred to as the "Non-BCI Version";

(c) A Non-BCI Version shall be sufficient to permit a reasonable understanding of its substance. In order to prepare such a Non-BCI Version:

(i) A Party may request the Party that originally submitted the BCI, as soon as possible, to indicate with precision portions of documents containing BCI that may be included in the non-BCI Version and, if necessary to permit a reasonable understanding of the substance of the information, produce a NonBCI summary in sufficient detail to achieve this aim.

(ii) Upon receipt of such a request, the Party that originally submitted the BCI shall, as soon as possible, indicate with precision portions of documents containing BCI that may be included in the Non-BCI Version and, if necessary to permit a reasonable understanding of the substance of the information, produce a Non-BCI summary in sufficient detail to achieve this aim.

BCI deleted, as indicated [***]

WT/DS353/R Page D-9

(iii) The Panel shall resolve any disagreement as to whether the Party that originally submitted the BCI failed to indicate with sufficient precision portions of documents containing BCI that may be included in the Non-BCI Version and to produce, if necessary, a Non-BCI summary in sufficient detail to permit a reasonable understanding of the substance of the information, and may take appropriate action to ensure that the provisions of this paragraph are satisfied.

(d) The responding Party may designate the personal offices of up to four of its Approved Persons as additional Secure sites for the sole purpose of storing and permitting review of the BCI versions of the Parties' submissions to the Panel. All of the protections applicable to BCI under these procedures, including the storage rules in paragraph 39, shall apply to such submissions. BCI exhibits may not, however, be stored at these locations. The addresses of these locations (including room number) shall be notified to the Panel and the complaining Party.

37. Any document containing BCI shall not be copied in excess of the number of copies required by the Approved Persons. All copies of such documents shall be consecutively numbered. The making of electronic copies shall be avoided whenever possible. Such documents may be transmitted electronically only by using secure e-mail. If a Party or Third Party submits to the Panel an original document that cannot be transmitted electronically, it shall on the day of submission deliver a copy of that document to the first secure site listed for the Parties/Third Parties in paragraph 17.
37bis. Notwithstanding paragraph 19 of the Working Procedures,5 the following procedures apply to the access by Third Parties to a Party's submission that contains Party-BCI.

(a) A Party's Submission containing Party-BCI shall not be serviced to Third Parties unless both Parties agree otherwise.

(b) Third Party BCI Approved Persons may view Party-BCI contained in a Party's first written submission only in a Designated Reading Room. Third Party BCI Approved Persons may not bring into that room any electronic recording or transmitting devices. Third Party BCI Approved Persons may not remove a Party's first written submission containing Party-BCI from that room, but may take handwritten notes of the Party-BCI contained therein. Such notes shall be used exclusively for this dispute (that is, DS353). Each person viewing a Party's first written submission containing Party-BCI shall complete and sign a log identifying the submission the person reviewed. The WTO Secretariat shall maintain such log until one year after the Conclusion of the Panel Process. Before entering and when leaving the room, Outside Advisors who are Third Party BCI Approved Persons may be subject to appropriate controls.

(c) If a Third Party BCI Approved Person removes from the Designated Reading Room a handwritten memo in accordance with subparagraph (b) above, that Third Party BCI Approved Person shall store the memo only in a locked security container. Such memo shall be appropriately protected against improper inspection and eavesdropping when being consulted and will be transmitted in sealed heavy duty double envelopes only. The content of such memo shall not be incorporated, electronically or in handwritten form, into the Non-BCI Version, as defined in paragraph 36(b).

5 Concerning service of documents.

BCI deleted, as indicated [***]

(d) All Third Parties that have designated Third Party BCI Approved Persons must inform the Panel and both Parties, by a date set by the Panel, the identity of the specific room (including the address and the room number) in which the locked security container, as referred to in subparagraph (c) above, is located.

(e) If a Third Party BCI Approved Person removes from the Designated Reading Room a handwritten memo in accordance with subparagraph (b) above, such memo shall not be copied in excess of the number of copies required by the Third Party BCI Approved Persons. All copies of such documents shall be consecutively numbered. The making of electronic copies of such memo shall be prohibited.

(f) A Third Party may not incorporate into the body of its submission any Party-BCI . If a Third Party wishes to refer to any Party-BCI, the relevant arguments including such BCI should be incorporated into a separate Appendix. Such Appendix shall not be serviced to other Third Parties.

(g) On the date determined by the Panel as the deadline to make the Third Party submission, a Third Party shall service its submission only to the Parties and to the Panel. The submission shall be serviced to the other Third Parties only after the Parties have confirmed that the submission does not contain or disclose Party-BCI. A Party shall make this confirmation or otherwise advise of any necessary change to the relevant Third Party within 2 working days of receiving the submissions of Third Parties.

38. A Party or Third Party that wishes to submit or refer to BCI at a Panel meeting shall so inform the Panel and the other Party, and Third Parties as appropriate. The Panel shall exclude persons who are not Approved Persons or, as appropriate, Third Party BCI Approved Persons from the meeting for the duration of the submission and discussion of BCI.

39. Approved Persons shall store BCI only in locked security containers. BCI shall be appropriately protected against improper inspection and eavesdropping when being consulted and will be transmitted in sealed heavy duty double envelopes only. All work papers (e.g., draft submissions, worksheets, etc.) containing BCI shall, when no longer needed, be shredded or burned consistent with normal government practice for destroying sensitive documents.

40. The Panel shall not disclose BCI in its report, but may make statements or draw conclusions that are based on the information drawn from the BCI.

VI. HSBI

41. Unless otherwise provided below, HSBI shall be subject to all the restrictions in Section V applicable to BCI.

42. HSBI shall be submitted to the WTO in electronic form, using locked CDs or two Sealed laptop computers connectable to 19" - 21" monitors. HSBI shall be stored at the HSBI location indicated in paragraph 10(a) and shall be made available for viewing and use by HSBI Approved Persons pursuant to paragraph 45 below. Each Party shall maintain an additional copy (electronic or hard) of the HSBI it submits to the WTO for access by HSBI Approved Persons acting on behalf of the other Party in the HSBI location listed in paragraph 10 located within the other Party's territory. A Stand-alone printer may be used to make hard copies of any HSBI. Such hard copies shall be made on distinctively colored paper. Such hard copies shall either be stored in a safe at the relevant HSBI location, or destroyed at the end of the relevant working session.

BCI deleted, as indicated [***]

WT/DS353/R Page D-11

43. If a Third Party submits HSBI, it shall notify the Parties of the fact that such submission has been made.

44. Except as otherwise provided in these procedures, HSBI shall not be stored, transmitted or copied either in written or electronic form.

45. HSBI Approved Persons of a Party may view HSBI on the Sealed laptop computer submitted by the other Party /a Third Party or, in the case of HSBI submitted on Locked CDs on a Stand-alone computer, only in a designated room at one of the HSBI locations indicated in paragraph 10, unless otherwise mutually agreed by the Parties. The designated room shall be available to HSBI Approved Persons from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. during official working days at the respective HSBI location, except at the location indicated in paragraph 10(a) where the room will be available at any time, including weekends, to the Panel and the PGE members or experts appointed by the Panel in accordance with paragraph 1(d), and to HSBI Approved Persons designated by the Director-General of the WTO or his designee. HSBI Approved Persons may not bring into that room any electronic recording or transmitting devices. HSBI Approved Persons may not remove HSBI from that room, except in the form of handwritten notes or aggregated information generated on a Stand-alone computer. In either case, such notes or information shall be used exclusively for this dispute in connection with which the HSBI has been submitted. Each person viewing the HSBI in the HSBI location shall complete and sign a log identifying the HSBI that the person reviewed or, alternatively, such a log can be generated automatically. Each Party shall, for the HSBI location within its territory referenced in paragraph 10, maintain such log until one year after the Conclusion of the Panel Process. Before entering and when leaving the room, Outside Advisors who are HSBI Approved Persons may be subject to appropriate controls. Viewing of HSBI at the location indicated in paragraph 10(a) by HSBI Approved Persons designated by the Parties shall be conducted under the observation of a WTO security guard or employee.

46. No Approved Person shall disclose HSBI to any person except another HSBI Approved Person, and then only for the purpose of this dispute.

49. All HSBI shall be stored in a safe at the relevant HSBI location.

50. The treatment in a Party's submissions to the Panel of any HSBI shall be governed by the provisions of this paragraph, which shall prevail to the extent of any conflict with the other provisions of the Working Procedures (including these Procedures) relating to HSBI.

(a) HSBI may be incorporated into a separate appendix to, but not the body of, a Party's submission, which shall be referred to as the "Full HSBI Version Appendix" of the appendix;

BCI deleted, as indicated [***]

(d) A Redacted Version Appendix shall be sufficient to permit a reasonable understanding of its substance. In order to prepare such a Redacted Version Appendix:

(i) A Party may request that the Party that originally submitted the HSBI, as soon as possible, indicate with precision portions of documents containing HSBI that may be included in the Redacted Version Appendix and, if necessary to permit a reasonable understanding of the substance of the information, produce a non-HSBI summary in sufficient detail to achieve this aim.

(ii) Upon receipt of such a request, the Party that originally submitted the HSBI shall, as soon as possible, indicate with precision portions of documents containing HSBI that may be included in the Redacted Version Appendix and, if necessary to permit a reasonable understanding of the substance of the information, produce a nonHSBI summary in sufficient detail to achieve this aim.

(iii) The Panel shall resolve any disagreement as to whether the Party that originally submitted the HSBI failed to indicate with sufficient precision portions of documents containing HSBI that may be included in the Redacted Version Appendix and to produce, if necessary, a non-HSBI summary in sufficient detail to permit a reasonable understanding of the substance of the information, and may take appropriate action to ensure that the provisions of this paragraph are satisfied.

(e) The Full HSBI Version Appendix shall be kept in an HSBI Location in the form of a locked CD. If that is not practical, the Party may keep it in a locked security container in a Secure Site in the form of a locked CD.
