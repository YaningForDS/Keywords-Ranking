The Panel on United States ­ Definitive Anti-Dumping And Countervailing Duties On Certain Products From China (WT/DS379) was established by the DSB on 20 January 2009 and composed on 4 March 2009.

Absent any further delays beyond the control of the Panel, the Panel expects to complete its work by May 2010.
