UNITED STATES ­ SUBSIDIES AND OTHER DOMESTIC SUPPORT FOR CORN AND OTHER AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS
Request for the Establishment of a Panel by Canada
The following communication, dated 8 November 2007, from the delegation of Canada to the Chairman of the Dispute Settlement Body, is circulated pursuant to Article 6.2 of the DSU.
_______________

On 7 February 2007, Canada and the United States held consultations with respect to whether the domestic support the United States provided in favour of its agricultural producers exceeded the commitment levels specified in Section I of Part IV of its Schedule, contrary to Article 3.2 of the Agreement on Agriculture. While the discussions were useful and clarified a number of issues, they did not resolve Canada's serious concerns regarding the Current Total Aggregate Measurement of Support provided by the United States. Accordingly, my authorities have now instructed me to request the establishment of a panel.
Pursuant to Articles 4, 6 and 7.1 of the Understanding on Rules and Procedures Governing the Settlement of Disputes, Article XXIII of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994, and Article 19 of the Agreement on Agriculture, Canada requests that the Dispute Settlement Body ("DSB") establish a panel with the standard terms of reference to consider the following matter:
That the United States' Current Total Aggregate Measurement of Support has exceeded its commitment levels in each of the years1 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2004 and 2005, contrary to Article 3.2 of the Agreement on Agriculture.
Pursuant to Article 3.2 of the Agreement on Agriculture, the United States committed to limit its Current Total Aggregate Measurement of Support to the annual levels specified in section I of Part IV of its Schedule: for the year 1999, USD 19,899.264 million and for each subsequent year, USD 19,103.294 million. Despite this, the United States' Current Total Aggregate Measurement of Support provided by the measures2 at issue, when properly calculated in accordance with the provisions of the Agreement on Agriculture, has exceeded its commitment levels in each of the years 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2004 and 2005, in violation of Article 3.2 of this agreement. These violations nullify or impair the benefits accruing to Canada under the Agreement on Agriculture.
The measures at issue are those identified in the Annex, which forms an integral part of this request. The measures further include any other legislation, regulations and other instruments not identified in the Annex, by which any of the support under the identified measures was provided.
Canada asks that this request for the establishment of a panel be placed on the agenda of the DSB meeting scheduled for 19 November 2007.
1 In this request, "year" has the meaning assigned to it in Article 1(i) of the Agreement on Agriculture. 2 In this request, "measures" refers to support programs as well as support provided pursuant to those programs.

ANNEX

In this Annex, where possible, Canada (a) identifies measures by the name or description used by the United States in its yearly Table DS:1 notifications3 as well as its periodic Table DS:2 notifications of new and modified measures4 (collectively the "Notifications"), and (b) relies upon the Notifications to identify the legal authority for those measures. Canada also identifies additional legal authority where appropriate. The years to which each measure relates are specified in the Notifications. Reference to measures identified in the Notifications is without prejudice to whether the notified amounts of support or categorization of measures are accurate.
This Annex also identifies by name or description measures not notified by the United States and the legal authority for those measures. The years to which each of the non-notified measures relates are specified in this Annex.
Each measure identified in this Annex comprises the support program (i.e., the overall design, structure and/or legal mechanism by which support is determined and/or granted) and the support provided pursuant to the support program. Thus, the use of terms such as "measures", "support", "payments" or "program" in this Annex encompasses both the support program and the support itself.
