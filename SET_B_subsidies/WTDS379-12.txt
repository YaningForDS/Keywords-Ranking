Status Report Regarding Implementation of the DSB Recommendations and Rulings in the Dispute United States ­ Definitive Anti-Dumping and Countervailing Duties
on Certain Products from China (WT/DS379)
The United States submits this report in accordance with Article 21.6 of the Understanding on Rules and Procedures Governing the Settlement of Disputes ("DSU").
On 25 March 2011, the Dispute Settlement Body ("DSB") adopted its recommendations and rulings in United States ­ Definitive Anti-Dumping and Countervailing Duties on Certain Products from China (WT/DS379). At the following DSB meeting, the United States informed the DSB of its intention to implement the recommendations and rulings of the DSB in connection with this matter. The United States and China agreed that the reasonable period of time for the United States to implement the recommendations and rulings of the DSB would end on 25 February 2012, and jointly notified the DSB of this agreement on 5 July 2011.
The United States Trade Representative made a written request to the Secretary of Commerce to issue determinations under section 129(b) of the Uruguay Round Agreements Act that would render US Department of Commerce ("Commerce") determinations in four original antidumping investigations and four original countervailing duty investigations of products from China ­ circular welded pipe, light-walled rectangular pipe and tube, certain new pneumatic off-the-road tires, and laminated woven sacks ­ not inconsistent with the recommendations and rulings of the DSB.
Commerce has been actively working on this matter and has issued questionnaires to Chinese respondents and to the Government of China, seeking additional information related to the issues on which the DSB adopted recommendations and rulings. Respondents have requested and Commerce has granted additional time for the submission of responses to the questionnaires. Commerce is analyzing responses provided to date and awaiting further responses from Chinese respondents and the Government of China.
The United States will continue to consult with interested parties as it works to address the recommendations and rulings of the DSB.
