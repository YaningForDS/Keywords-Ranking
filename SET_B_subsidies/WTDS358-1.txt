These measures appear to provide such refunds, reductions or exemptions to enterprises in China on the condition that those enterprises purchase domestic over imported goods, or on the condition that those enterprises meet certain export performance criteria. Accordingly, the measures appear to be inconsistent with Article 3 of the SCM Agreement. Furthermore, to the extent the measures accord imported products treatment less favorable than that accorded "like" domestic products, they appear inconsistent with Article III:4 of the GATT 1994 and Article 2 of the TRIMs Agreement. The measures also appear not to comply with China's obligations under paragraphs 7.2-7.3 and 10.3 of Part I of its Accession Protocol18, as well as paragraph 1.2 of Part I of its Accession Protocol (to the extent that it incorporates paragraphs 167 and 203 of the Report of the Working Party on the Accession of China19), which forms part of the terms of accession agreed between China and the WTO and is an integral part of the Marrakesh Agreement Establishing the World Trade Organization.
We look forward to receiving your reply to the present request and to fixing a mutually convenient date for consultations.
