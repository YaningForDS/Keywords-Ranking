a. Sections 921-927 of the Internal Revenue Code and related measures establishing special tax treatment for "Foreign Sales Corporations" ("FSCs") including individual applications;

8. Other Subsidies
Any other support not included in paragraphs 1-6 above which involves a financial contribution by US, State, or Local entitles or entities controlled by US government entities pursuant to any laws, regulations, administrative procedures, administrative practices and any other present measures, amendments thereto, or future measures which benefit the US LCA Industry.
The European Communities considers that these measures are inconsistent with the obligations of the United States under the following provisions:
(1) Articles 3.1 (a) and (b) and 3.2 of the SCM Agreement; (2) Article 5 (a) and (c) of the SCM Agreement; (3) Article 6.3(a), (b), and (c) of the SCM Agreement; (4) Article III:4 of the GATT 1994.
The European Communities is of the view that the US, State and Local statutes, regulations, and administrative procedures listed above are inconsistent with these provisions as such and as applied.
The measures listed above are subsidies because in each instance there is a financial contribution by the US, State or Local government, or an income or price support in the sense of Article XVI of GATT 1994, and a benefit is thereby conferred within the meaning of Article 1.1(a) and (b) of the SCM Agreement. Each of the listed subsidies is specific to the US LCA industry within the meaning of Article 2 of the SCM Agreement.
The use of these measures causes adverse effects, i.e. serious prejudice or a threat of serious prejudice to the interests of the European Communities and material injury or threat of material injury to the European Communities LCA industry:
­ The effect of the measures is significant price depression and price suppression in the markets for LCA products in the European Communities and elsewhere or a threat thereof in violation of Articles 5(c) and 6.3(c) of the SCM Agreement.
­ The effect of the measures is significant lost sales in the markets for LCA products or a threat thereof in violation of Articles 5(c) and 6.3(c) of the SCM Agreement.
­ The effect of the measures is to displace or impede exports of European Community LCA products in the US market or a threat thereof in violation of Articles 5(c) and 6.3(a) of the SCM Agreement.

WT/DS317/1 G/L/698 G/SCM/D63/1 Page 4
­ The effect of the measures is to displace or impede exports of European Community LCA products in third country markets or a threat thereof in violation of Articles 5(c) and 6.3(b) of the SCM Agreement.
­ The effect of the measures led or threatens to lead to significantly lower revenues received by the European Communities' LCA industry and is to cause material injury or threat thereof in violation of Article 5(a) of the SCM Agreement.
Articles 4.2 and 7.2 of the SCM Agreement together require that this request for consultations includes a statement of available evidence (1) with regard to the existence and nature of the subsidies in question and (2) the adverse effects to the interests of the European Communities. This letter identifies the existence and nature of the subsidies, and further evidence is provided in the Annex to this letter.
The European Communities reserves the right to request the United States to produce information and documents regarding the measures in question and their effect on the interests of the European Communities, during the consultation process. The European Communities also reserves the right to address additional measures and claims under other WTO provisions during the course of the consultations.
My authorities look forward to receiving in due course a reply from the United States to this request. The European Communities is ready to consider with the United States mutually convenient dates to hold consultations in Geneva.

(b) Serious Prejudice to the Interests of the European Communities
The European Communities has voluminous evidence that the subsidies granted to the US large civil aircraft industry has caused and is continuing to cause adverse effects through significant price suppression or depression of prices of large civil aircraft worldwide, significant price undercutting and significant lost sales by the EC industry in the market for large civil aircraft.
