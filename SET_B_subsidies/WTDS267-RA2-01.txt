A. UPLAND COTTON
1. Please confirm that all information and data that you have provided to the Panel relating to "cotton" in fact relates to upland cotton only. BRA, USA
Brazil's answer:
1. Brazil can confirm that, except as explicitly stated otherwise, all the data and references made by Brazil to "cotton" relate and will relate to "upland cotton" only.
B. PRELIMINARY ISSUES
Note to parties: As indicated in the cover note, the Panel has expressed its views in respect of the three United States requests for preliminary rulings. The Panel's questions reflected in this compilation relating to the requested preliminary rulings on which the Panel has expressed its views are those that were posed in the course of the first session of the first Panel meeting. This is to give an opportunity for the parties to transpose into writing their oral responses.
1. Product scope of Panel's terms of reference relating to Brazil's export credit guarantee claims
2. Is Brazil's claim in relation to export credit guarantees against the measures said to constitute the GSM-102, GSM-103 and SCGP programmes in their entire application, or against the measures said to constitute the GSM-102, GSM-103 and SCGP programmes in their application to upland cotton, or both? BRA
Brazil's answer:
2. Brazil confirms that its claims against GSM 102, GSM 103 and SCGP concern the programmes in their entirety and are not limited to their application to upland cotton.
3. If the request for consultations in this dispute omitted certain products in relation to export credit guarantees, on what basis is it argued that it failed to identify the measures at issue in accordance with Article 4.4 of the DSU? USA
4. Is it argued that the export credit guarantee programmes concerning upland cotton are each a separate or independent measure, in that they operate independently? USA
5. Is there a specification in any legislation or regulation (or any other official government document) which limit or restrict the export credit guarantee programmes at issue exclusively to upland cotton? USA
6. For the purposes of the Panel's examination of Brazil's claims relating to GSM-102, GSM-103 and SCGP under the Agreement on Agriculture and the SCM Agreement, is accurate data and information available with respect to these export credit guarantee programmes concerning upland cotton alone (e.g. with respect to "long-term operating costs and losses")? In this respect, the Panel also directs the parties' attention to the specific questions below relating to the programmes. USA
7. Are commitments with respect to export subsidies under the Agreement on Agriculture commodity-specific? How, if at all, is this relevant? BRA, USA

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-9
Brazil's answer:
3. Under Articles 3.3 and 8 of the Agreement on Agriculture, a Member can only grant export subsidies for agricultural products if that Member has an export subsidy reduction commitment for the agricultural product in question. The commodity specific aspect becomes relevant in Step 2 and ETI export subsidies because the United States scheduled no reduction commitments for upland cotton. In the case of the export credit guarantee programs challenged by Brazil, the commodity specific aspect becomes relevant only after the Panel has found that export credit guarantees are export subsidies within the meaning of the Agreement on Agriculture. At that stage, the Panel needs to examine whether (a) for the group of unscheduled commodities, which includes upland cotton, and (b) for each of scheduled commodities, there is a threat of circumvention of the US export subsidy reduction commitments. Brazil has set forth its arguments that GSM 102, GSM 103 and SCGP violate Article 10.1 of the Agreement on Agriculture for both scheduled and unscheduled commodities in paragraphs 295-305 of its First Submission.
4. The commodity-specific nature of export subsidy reduction commitments is, however, irrelevant for determining whether GSM 102, GSM 103 and SCGP in their application to all eligible products are within the Panel's terms of reference.
8. Does the United States confirm that the questions referred to by Brazil in paragraph 92 of Brazil's oral statement were posed to the United States in the consultations? USA
9. How does the United States respond to paragraph 94 of Brazil's oral statement? USA
10. What actual prejudice, if any, has the United States suffered as a result of the alleged omission of products other than upland cotton from the request for consultations? USA
11. Does the United States agree that Brazil's request for establishment of the Panel can be understood to indicate that Brazil's export credit guarantee claims relatesto products other than upland cotton? How, if at all, is this relevant? USA
12. Please address issues and submit evidence regarding the three export credit guarantee programmes concerned relating to upland cotton and other eligible agricultural commodities in your answers to questions and rebuttal submissions. BRA, USA
Brazil's answer:
5. Brazil has presented its arguments and evidence concerning the three export credit guarantee programmes always with respect to all eligible agricultural commodities1 and will continue to do so in its answers to these questions and in future submissions to the Panel.
13. Please include any argumentation and evidence to support your statement during the Panel meeting that the inclusion of such other eligible agricultural commodities would create additional "work" for the Panel with respect to each of these commodities under Article 13 of the Agreement on Agriculture. USA
1 See paragraphs 252-314 of the First Submission of Brazil and paragraphs 116-133 of the Oral Statement of Brazil.

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-10
2. Expired measures
14. Please submit evidence regarding the programmes under the 1996 FAIR Act, in particular, production flexibility contract payments and market loss assistance payments, to the extent that they would be relevant to the Panel's determination under Article 13 of the Agreement on Agriculture in your answers to questions and rebuttal submission. USA
15. Do the parties agree that it is beyond a Panel's power to recommend a remedy for an expired measure? Could the Panel could be required to examine "expired measures" in order to conduct its assessment of the matter before it? How, if at all, is Article 7.8 of the SCM Agreement relevant to these matters? BRA, USA
Brazil's answer:
6. The Panel must examine any continuing effects of subsidies provided by expired measures, and it can recommend a remedy for any such continuing effects. Brazil has set forth its arguments in that respect in paragraphs 4-7 of its Closing Statement at the First Substantive Meeting of the Panel with the Parties, as well as in paragraphs 141-144 of its Oral Statement at the same meeting. Subsidies provided under expired subsidy measures can be the source of present adverse effects. Preventing a panel from examining expired measures in its assessment of the matter before it would render the adverse effects provisions of the SCM Agreement a nullity, as a Member would be freed from any responsibility for the effects of its subsidies by, for example, simply letting the legislation expire and renewing it every year (or in even shorter periods). The Panel is, thus, required to analyze the effects of subsidies provided by production flexibility contract ("PFC") payments and market loss assistance payments in its assessment of Brazil's adverse effects claims. Disregarding those payments would not enable the Panel to conduct "an objective assessment of the matter before it", as it would disregard a source of present adverse effects.2
7. Article 7.8 of the SCM Agreement offers the Panel the possibility to recommend a remedy for the adverse effects from subsidies provided by expired measures. Under Article 7.8, a Panel can recommend that a Member withdraw the adverse effects of the expired measures. By virtue of DSU Appendix 2, Article 7.8, not DSU Article 19, provides the basis for remedies involving claims under Articles 5 and 6 of the SCM Agreement. In making recommendations under such claims, the Panel is not limited to a recommendation that a Member bring its measures into conformity with a covered agreement. Rather, a Panel finding adverse effects caused by a Member's actionable subsidies must recommend that the Member withdraw the subsidy or remove the adverse effects.
8. In sum, the Panel is required to objectively assess the present effects of PFC and market loss assistance payments on US production, US exports and prices of upland cotton. If it finds that these subsidies cause adverse effects within the meaning of Articles 5 and 6 of the SCM Agreement ­ as Brazil believes the Panel will find based on the arguments and evidence to be presented by Brazil on 9 September 2003 ­ the Panel should recommend that the United States remove the adverse effects pursuant to ASCM Article 7.8.
3. Agricultural Assistance Act of 2003
16. What, if any, prejudice in terms of the presentation of its case does the United States allege, should the Panel proceed to consider the measures constituting the cottonseed payments under the Agricultural Assistance Act of 2003? USA
2 The analysis in this paragraph is relevant to the first paragraph of Brazil's Answer to Panel Question 19.

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-11
17. (a) What is the relationship of the Agricultural Assistance Act of 2003 to other legislation in the request for establishment of the Panel? BRA, USA
(b) Do the legal instruments follow directly one after another, or are there temporal gaps? Are payments authorized under a broad legislative authority or are they specific to each legal instrument? BRA, USA
(c) Please provide any implementing regulations. Do these implementing regulations resemble those relating to previous programmes or payments? Are payments made retrospectively? How if at all is this relevant? BRA, USA
Brazil's answer:
9. Cottonseed payments for MY 2002, as with the previous cottonseed payments in MY 1999 and 2000, were authorized by annual appropriations acts involving a variety of other legislative provisions that do not relate to cottonseed payments.3 Public Law 106-113, inter alia, appropriated funds otherwise unused for assistance to producers or first-handlers of the MY 1999 crop of cottonseed.4 The United States indicated in consultations that $79 million had in fact been used for that purpose. Public Law 106-224, inter alia, appropriates $100 million for assistance to producers and first-handlers of the MY 2000 crop of cottonseed.5 Public Law 107-25, inter alia, added an appropriation of $84.7 million for assistance to producers and first-handlers of the same MY 2000 crop of cottonseed.6 No cottonseed payments were authorized for MY 2001. The Agricultural Assistance Act of 2003, inter alia, appropriated cottonseed payments for the 2002 crop in the amount of $50 million.7
10. None of these statutory provisions contains any guidance on how USDA was to implement the cottonseed payments. Eligibility, administration, application and payment rates and details are all provided for in regulations. Brazil has provided in Exhibit Bra-32 the regulations applicable to the MY 2000 crop of cottonseed. Regulations governing payments for the MY 2002 crop of cottonseed were issued on 25 April 2003 and are set forth in Exhibit Bra-139. Comparing these regulations with the regulations that implement 2002 cottonseed payments8 demonstrates that both regulations are almost identical. In fact, the preamble to the 2002-crop regulations provides that "[p]revious 1999crop and 2000-crop cottonseed programs were codified in 7 CFR part 1427. This rule follows the model set by those preceding programs."9 Additionally the preamble to the regulations states:
Presumably, Congress expected the old programme to serve as the model for the new programme provided for in the new legislation as no dissatisfaction was expressed.10
11. This evidence demonstrates that the Cottonseed Payment Programme in MY 2002 was a continuation of the Cottonseed Payment Programme with respect to MY 1999 and 2000. The Agricultural Assistance Act of 2003 appropriated new funds for the MY 2002 crop to the existing programme (after no such appropriations took place for MY 2001). The 2002 cottonseed payments provided for in the Agricultural Assistance Act of 2003 are "future measures implementing"11 the
3 Exhibit Bra-135 (Agricultural Assistance Act of 2003, in P.L. 108-7), Exhibit Bra-136 (P.L. 106113), Exhibit Bra-137 (P.L. 106-224) and P.L. Exhibit Bra-138 (107-25).
4 Exhibit Bra-136 (Section 104 of P.L. 106-113). 5 Exhibit Bra-137 (Section 204(e) of P.L. 106-224). 6 Exhibit Bra-138 (Section 6 of P.L. 107-25). 7 Exhibit Bra-135 (Section 206 of P.L. 108-7). 8 Exhibit Bra-139 (68 Federal Register 20331). 9 Exhibit Bra-139 (68 Federal Register 20331, p. 20331). 10 Exhibit Bra-139 (68 Federal Register 20331, p. 20332). 11 Brazil's Request For the Establishment of a Panel, WT/DS267/7, p. 2. See Appellate Body Report, Chile ­ Agricultural Products (Price Band), WT/DS207/AB/R, paras. 135-136 and 144.

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-12
existing (but unfunded) Cottonseed Payment Program, which formed part of the request for consultations and which has been consulted upon. The MY 2002 cottonseed payments are therefore within the terms of reference of this Panel and Brazil is entitled to challenge the adverse effects caused by these payments.
12. Finally, the Agricultural Assistance Act of 2003 appropriated $50 million in cottonseed payments expressly for the MY 2002 crop. Payments will be made after the United States has received all applications and has calculated the payment rate.12 Since, payments are made after the 2002 crop has been harvested, payments can be considered to be made retrospectively. Yet, irrespectively of when the payments are made and irrespective of the Panel's decision whether they form part of the Panel's terms of reference, they are made in respect of MY 200213 and, therefore, these payments should be included in the calculation of the MY 2002 support to upland cotton for purposes of the test under Article 13(b)(ii) of the Agreement on Agriculture.
18. If the Panel is correct in understanding that cottonseed payments are divided between processors and producers, how is this reflected in Brazil's calculations? BRA
Brazil's answer:
13. Brazil has included the full amount of cottonseed payments in its peace clause calculations for MY 1999, 2000 and 2002 because cottonseed payments constitute support to upland cotton. This approach is consistent with the United States' notifications of these payments as product-specific support to upland cotton in its notification of domestic support for MY 1999.14
14. Brazil furthermore notes that the full amount of cottonseed payments is available to stimulate production and distort trade. Including the full amount of cottonseed payments is also consistent with basic principles of microeconomics that the incidence of a tax or subsidy does not depend on where in the processing chain the tax or subsidy is applied. The production or consumption effects of a tax or subsidy depends on supply and demand elasticities and market conditions, but these market impacts do not depend on whether government checks are written in the name of farmers or initial processors.15
C. MEASURES AT ISSUE
19. The Panel notes that Brazil's panel request refers, inter alia, to alleged "subsidies" and "domestic support" "provided" in various contexts. Please specify the measures, in particular, the legislative and regulatory provisions, by number and letter, in respect of which Brazil seeks relief and indicate where each is referred to in the panel request. BRA
Brazil's answer:
15. Brazil's Request for Establishment of a Panel ("Panel Request") challenges two types of domestic support "measures" provided to upland cotton and various different types of export subsidy measures. The first type of domestic support "measure" is the payment of subsidies for the production and use of upland cotton. These payments were and continue to be made between MY 1999 to the present (and will be made through MY 2007) through the various statutory and regulatory instruments listed on pages 2-3 of Brazil's Panel Request. Brazil referred to these payments at pages 2-3 of the Panel Request as "subsidies and domestic support provided under" or "mandated to
12 Exhibit Bra-139 (7 CFR 1427.1107-1110 as provided in 68 Federal Register 20331, p. 20333). 13 See Brazil's answer to Question 34. 14 See Exhibit Bra-47 (G/AG/N/USA/43, p. 20). 15 Exhibit Bra-140 (Pindyck, Robert S. and Rubinfeld, Daniel L. , Microeconomics, 5th edition (2002), Prentice Hall, New Jersey, p. 313-317).

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-13
be provided" under the various listed statutory and regulatory instruments. Brazil has tabulated the different types of payments (i.e., the measures) made under these legal instruments in paragraphs 146149 of its First Submission. Brazil's "Further Submission" on 9 September 2003 will provide considerable detail concerning the effects of the subsidies provided and mandated to be provided by the United States. It is these effects in respect of which Brazil seeks relief with respect to the first type of domestic support measures.
16. A second type of domestic support "measure" challenged by Brazil are legal instruments as such. The "legislative and regulatory provisions, by number and letter, in respect of which Brazil seeks relief" are those involving the 2002 FSRI Act and the 2000 Agricultural Risk Protection Act and in particular the following:16
· Marketing loan/loan deficiency payments: Sections 1201(a)-(b), 1202(a)(6), 1202(b)(6), 1204(b), 1205(a)(1), 1205(b), 1205(c)(1), 1608 of the 2002 FSRI Act and 7 U.S.C. 7286 (Section 166 of the 1996 FAIR Act as amended) and 7 CFR 1427.22 to the extent that these provisions require the provision of marketing loan and loan deficiency payments for all production of upland cotton.
· Counter-cyclical payments: Section 1104(a)-(f)(1) of the 2002 FSRI Act and 7 CFR 1412.503.
· Direct payments: Section 1103(a)-(d)(1) of the 2002 FSRI Act and 7 CFR 1412.502.
· Step 2 Domestic Payments: Section 1207(a) of the 2002 FRSI Act and 7 CFR 1427.103, 7 CFR 1427.104(a)(1), 7 CFR 1427.105(a), 7 CFR 1427.108(d) requiring cotton user marketing certificate ("Step 2") payments to be made to domestic users of US upland cotton.
· Crop Insurance payments: Section 508(a)(8), 508(b)(1), 508(b)(2)(A)(ii), 508(b)(3), 508(e) and 508(k) of the 2000 ARP Act17 mandating the provision or crop insurance policies to farmers, premium subsidies to farmers and reinsurance to insurance providers to the extent that these provisions apply to upland cotton. Section 516 providing for unlimited funding of the crop insurance programme to the extent that these funds are available to upland cotton producers
17. Finally, Brazil challenges three types of export subsidies provided by the United States. Regarding Step 2 export subsidies, the measure Brazil challenges is Section 1207(a) of the FSRI Act, and 7 CFR 1427.103, 7 CFR 1427.104(a)(2), 7 CFR 1427.105(a), and 7 CFR 1427.108(d) requiring cotton user marketing certificate ("Step 2") payments to be made to exporters of US upland cotton.18 Brazil also challenges as a "measure" subsidies provided by Step 2 export programme as actionable subsidies.
18. Regarding Brazil's ETI Act claim, the measure challenged by Brazil is the FSC Repeal and Extraterritorial Exclusion Act of 2000, Public Law 106-519, 114 Stat. 2423 (2000), and in particular, Section 3 (entitled "Treatment of Extraterritorial Income"), which amends the US Internal Revenue

Code (IRC) by inserting into it a new Section 114, as well as a new Subpart E, which is in turn composed of new IRC Sections 941, 942 and 943.19
19. With respect to Brazil's export credit guarantee claims, the measures challenged by Brazil are the GSM 102, GSM 103 and SCGP programs as established and maintained by 7 U.S.C. 562220 and 7 CFR 1493.21 Brazil challenges 7 U.S.C. 5622(a)(1) and (b),22 which provide for the extension of export credit guarantees on terms better than those available on the marketplace. Furthermore, Brazil challenges the maintenance of the GSM 102, GSM 103 and SCGP programs at premium rates that are inadequate to cover the long-term operating costs and losses of the programs. Additionally, Brazil challenges the failure of 7 U.S.C. 5622 and 7 CFR 1493 to prevent circumvention (or the threat of circumvention) of the US export subsidy commitments under the Agreement on Agriculture. Brazil also challenges as a "measure" GSM 102, GSM 103 and SCGP export credit guarantees facilitating the production and export of US upland cotton as actionable subsidies and thereby causing adverse effects to the interests of Brazil.
D. ARTICLE 13(B): DOMESTIC SUPPORT MEASURES
1. "exempt from actions"
20. In paragraph 8 of its initial brief (dated 5 June, 2003), the United States argued that the word "actions" as used in the phrase "exempt from actions" in Article 13 of the Agreement on Agriculture includes the "bringing of a case" and consultations. In paragraph 36 of its first written submission (dated 11 July, 2003), the United States stated as follows:
"[P]rior to this point in the process, the DSU rules did not afford the United States any opportunity to prevent the dispute from proceeding through consultations and panel establishment automatically, regardless of the US insistence that its measures conform to the Peace Clause."
Is it the United States' understanding that the drafters used the phrase "exempt from actions" knowing that under the DSU it would not be possible fully to exempt "actions", as the United States interprets that term? USA
21. In US - FSC and US - FSC (21.5) the Appellate Body made findings under the SCM Agreement relating to export subsidies in respect of agricultural products without making a finding in respect of Article 13 of the Agreement on Agriculture. How is this relevant to the United States' interpretation of the phrase "exempt from actions" as used in Article 13? USA
2. "such measures" and Annex 2 of the Agreement on Agriculture
22. Please explain the difference, if any, between the meaning of "defined" and the meaning of "fixed" in the phrase "a defined and fixed base period" in paragraph 6(a) of Annex 2 of the Agreement on Agriculture. BRA, USA

Brazil's answer:
20. The meaning of the term "defined" in relation to "base period" is the period of time used to define the parameters ("indicate the extent"23) of the base period. The word "period" is defined as "a course or extent of time".24 For example, the "defined" "base period" to determine the amount of upland cotton base acreage for the PFC (and market loss assistance) payments was the average planted and considered planted acreage during MY 1993-95.25 The term "fixed" in relation to "base period" means that the "defined" base period cannot change or be updated. This is confirmed by the dictionary meaning of the term "fixed," which is "definitely and permanently placed or assigned; stationary or unchanging in relative position; definite, permanent, lasting."26 In sum, a base period is first "defined" in terms of a period of time, and then that period remains definitely and permanently assigned.
23. Please explain the meaning of "a" in "a defined and fixed base period" in paragraph 6(a) of Annex 2 of the Agreement on Agriculture, the meaning of "the" in "the base period" in paragraphs 6(b), (c) and (d), and the difference between these and the phrase "based on the years 1986-88" in Annex 3. BRA, USA
Brazil's answer:
21. Paragraph 6(a) requires Members to establish clearly defined eligibility criteria for a decoupled direct payment measure. These eligibility criteria must be taken from "a" defined and fixed base period of time. Paragraph 5 of Annex 2 makes it clear that all of the subparagraphs of paragraph 6 apply to the same type of de-coupled income support. Thus, a de-coupled income support measure with "a" "fixed base period" must also comply with Annex 2, paragraphs 6(b), (c) and (d). These subparagraphs use the phrase "after the base period." Because Article 6(a) establishes that there can only be "a" (single) "fixed" base period for a particular de-coupled domestic support measure, the use of the term "the" in 6(b)-(d) refers back to "a" "fixed" base period established in Article 6(a). Thus, a de-coupled income support measure can have only one "fixed" base period.
22. The Panel is faced with the question whether a Member can make minor adjustments to a decoupled support measure, label it a new decoupled support measure and then update the base period. Guidance for this question is provided by the first part of Annex 2, paragraph 6(a), which sets out a transparency requirement that eligibility criteria for decoupled support measures be determined by "clearly-defined criteria". In assessing whether one decoupled income support measure is essentially the same as a replacement decoupled income support measure, the Panel could examine the eligibility criteria for each set of measures. If the structure, design, and eligibility criteria have not significantly changed between the original measure (containing the "fixed base period") and its replacement, then there is no basis for any updating of the "fixed base period".
23. The factual question the Panel must address in this case is whether the "direct payment" programme in the 2002 FSRI Act contains similar design, structure, and eligibility criteria as the "production-flexibility contract payments" for upland cotton in the 1996 FAIR Act. The clearest evidence that the direct payment programme is the direct successor to production flexibility contracts is found in Section 1107(b) of the 2002 FSRI Act. It provides as follows:
If a producer receives all or any portion of the payment authorized for fiscal year 2002 under a production flexibility contract, the Secretary shall reduce the amount of

See also Exhibit Bra-31 (7 CFR 1412.103) in connection with Exhibit US-3 (7 CFR 1413.7(c)). 26 The New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary, 1993 edition, p. 962.

the direct payment otherwise due the producer for the 2002 crop year under section
1103 by the amount of fiscal year 2002 payment received by the producer under the production flexibility contract.27

24. Trading PFC dollars for direct payment dollars makes perfect sense given the very close similarities in the eligibility criteria between PFC and direct payments reflected in the statutes and regulations governing each. This is best illustrated in the following table:

not statutory rates but resulted from the allocation of a fixed amount of budgetary outlays to holders of upland

25. For an upland cotton producer with upland cotton base in MY 2001 and MY 2002, the direct payments available in MY 2002 were based on the following four elements: (1) yield (the average of the farm for MY 1981-85), (2) base acreage for the farm (resulting from either MY 1993-95 or MY 1998-2001 production), (3) only 85 percent of base acres could receive payment, and (4) the payment rate of $0.0677 cents per pound (applied to base acreage x yield x .85). The production flexibility contract payment for that same upland cotton farmer in MY 2001 would have been based on (1) yield (the average for MY 1981-85), (2) base acreage resulting from MY 1993-95 production, (3) only 85 percent of base acres could receive payment, and (4) 5.99 cents per pound.45 Thus, with the exception of the per pound payment rate ­ which increased under the 2002 FSRI Act ­ and the ability in 2002 to update base acreage, the payment formula was the same under both programmes.
26. In addition to these payment formula similarities, the eligibility criteria for an upland cotton producer in MY 2001 and MY 2002 are either identical or very similar under both programmes. For example, eligible recipients under both programmes are "producers," defined in each programme as "an owner, operator, landlord, tenant, or sharecropper that shares in the risk of producing a crop".46 The "producer" under each programme could not plant fruits, vegetables, tree nuts or wild rice without either a forfeiture of all payments or a reduction of payments.47 And each "producer" under both programmes had to maintain the land in agricultural use and adhere to conservation requirements.48
27. In addition to the possibility to update the base acreage, another difference between the PFC and direct payment is the addition of three additional programme crops for purposes of the direct payment programme ­ soybeans, other oilseeds, and peanuts.49 Further, instead of a single seven-year contract, annual contacts are entered into between USDA and "producers" who must demonstrate that they are eligible for payments based, inter alia, on demonstrating that they "share in the risk of producing a crop and are entitled to share in the crop available for marketing from the farm".50 The final difference was to set fixed amounts of payments per pound that did not decrease over the sixyear term of the 2002 FSRI Act. The 1996 FAIR Act based the payment rate on annual budgeted amounts and as the budgeted amounts declined, the payment rate declined.
28. None of these changes to the direct payment programme in any way changed the eligibility criteria, the design, or the structure of the production flexibility programme as it applied to upland cotton producers. For the typical upland cotton producer farming on upland cotton base acreage, the only thing that changed was that the producer received the option to increase payments by updating base acreage and obtained an increased payment rate. Given the identical nature of most aspects of the production flexibility contract payments and direct payments, there was no basis to change the "fixed base period" of marketing years 1993-1995 for the calculation of these direct payments.
29. In light of this evidence, the Panel is not faced in this case with the situation where a Member significantly changes the structure, design, and eligibility criteria of an older measure. For example, if a Member replaces an amber box domestic support measure with a green box measure, the structure
44 Exhibit Bra-35 (7 CFR 1412.203) 45 Exhibit Bra-142 (Agricultural Outlook, May 2002, p. 50). Brazil notes that this payment rate was not a statutory rate but resulted from the allocation of a fixed amount of budgetary outlays to holders of upland cotton base under the PFC programme in MY 2001. 46 Exhibit Bra-29 (7 CFR 1001(1) of the 2002 FSRI Act), Exhibit Bra-28 (Section 102(12) of the 1996 FAIR Act) 47 Exhibit Bra-28 (Section 118 b(1) of the 1996 FAIR Act), Exhibit Bra-29 (Section 1106 b(3) of the 2002 FSRI Act). 48 Exhibit Bra-31 (7 CFR 1410.20) and Exhibit Bra-35 (7 CFR 1412.203) 49 Exhibit Bra-29 (Section 1101-1103 of the 2002 FSRI Act), Exhibit Bra-27 ("Side by Side Comparison of the 1996 and 2002 Farm Act, USDA). 50 Exhibit Bra-29 (Section 1001(1) of the 2002 FSRI Act).

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-18
and eligibility criteria is likely to be sufficiently different to permit the establishment of a new "fixed" base period for the new measure. But replacing an older green box measure with a new alleged green box measure, which basically only updates the base period and thereby results in increased payments, violates the requirement of "a" "fixed" base period in Article 6(a).51
30. Finally, Brazil believes that Annex 3, paragraphs 9 and 11 provide contextual support for the requirement that "a" "fixed" base period for essentially the same measure should not be changed. For the purposes of calculating total AMS, Annex 3 establishes "a" "fixed" base period ­ 1986-1988 ­ for determining the reference price that serves as a basis for the formula approach to calculating AMS for price support measures. This base period could not be changed without eliminating the basis for calculating the total AMS and the required reductions in domestic support. Similarly, paragraphs 6(a) and 6(b) of Annex 2 require a fixed base period and prevent an updating of a base period for "green box" domestic support measures that remain essentially the same programme.
24. How often can a Member define and fix a base period in accordance with paragraph 6 of Annex 2 of the Agreement on Agriculture? BRA, USA
Brazil's answer:
31. As set out in Brazil's Answer to Panel Question 23, the answer is never if the replacement decoupled direct payment measure has a comparable structure, design and eligibility criteria as the older de-coupled direct payment measure.
25. Does the United States consider that there is any ambiguity in the term "type of production" as used in paragraph 6(b) of Annex 2 of the Agreement on Agriculture? USA
26. Can the United States confirm Brazil's assertions in paragraph 174 of its first written submission that the implementing regulations for direct payments prohibit or limit payments if base acreage is used for the production of certain crops? If so, can the United States clarify the statement in paragraph 56 of its first written submission that direct payments are made regardless of what is currently produced on those acres? Can the United States confirm the same point in relation to production flexibility contracts? USA
27. Does Brazil argue that any United States measure that does not comply with the fundamental requirement of paragraph 1 of Annex 2 of the Agreement on Agriculture is actionable independently of any failure of that measure to comply with the basic or policyspecific criteria in Annex 2? BRA
Brazil's Answer:
32. Yes. A domestic support measure that does not meet the "fundamental requirement" of the first sentence of Annex 2, paragraph 1, cannot be considered to be properly in the "green box". In addition to the arguments at paragraphs 163-172 of Brazil's First Submission, Brazil provides additional rationale for this argument below.
33. The use of the words "fundamental requirement" in the first sentence of paragraph 1, Annex 2, demonstrates that the obligation contained in the sentence is separate and distinct from the obligation to meet the basic and policy-specific requirements set forth in Annex 2. The ordinary meaning of those words, in that context and in light of the object and purpose of the Agreement in Agriculture, support this interpretation.
51 See First Submission of Brazil, paras. 177-181.

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-19
34. The ordinary meaning of "requirement" is "a thing required or needed, a want, a need; something called for or demanded; a conditions which must be complied with".52 Interpreted in the context of paragraph 1, Annex 2, it means that having no, or at most minimal, trade-distorting effects or effects on production is a condition for a domestic support measure, which must be complied with, for exempting this domestic support measure from the reduction commitments.
35. The word "fundamental" qualifies the word "requirement". The ordinary meaning of the term "fundamental" is "going to the root of the matter; serving as the base or foundation; essential or indispensable".53 The use of this adjective emphasizes and underscores that the requirement that a measure does not have trade-distorting effects or effects on production is essential and indispensable for a domestic support measure to be exempted from reduction commitments.
36. In sum, the ordinary meaning of a "fundamental requirement" is an "essential and indispensable condition that must be complied with". It follows that the fundamental requirement in the first sentence of Annex 2, paragraph 1 must be read as a stand-alone obligation and that it is untenable to relegate the obligation in the first sentence of Annex 2, paragraph 1 to a policy objective role that merely informs the rest of the Annex. Instead, it is a condition of central importance that all domestic support measures must meet in order to be exempted from reduction commitments. Its importance is such that it serves as the premise on which the basic and policy-specific criteria are predicated.
37. The principle of effective interpretation (l'effet utile), recognized by panels and the Appellate Body, requires that a treaty be interpreted to give meaning and effect to all the terms of the treaty. The first sentence of Annex 2, paragraph 1 of the Agreement on Agriculture, which imposes an obligation in clear and unequivocal terms, has to be accorded full meaning. Nothing suggests that recognizing the fundamental requirement as a stand-alone obligation would undermine or render inutile the obligation to conform to the basic and policy-specific criteria. To interpret the fundamental requirement as a policy objective that merely informs the rest of Annex 2 would detract from the unambiguous obligation that domestic support measures have no, or at most minimal, trade-distorting effects or effects on production.
38. The obligation to meet the fundamental requirement set forth in Annex 2, paragraph 1 is the overriding principle that determines whether a measure can be exempt from reduction commitments. The purpose of the disciplines on domestic support in the Agreement on Agriculture, made effective in part through the reduction commitments, is to eliminate trade and production-distorting effects of domestic support measures or permit these measures to only have at most minimal trade or production-distorting effects. Where a measure does not create trade-distorting effects or effects on production, the rationale for limiting the use of that support measure disappears. Conversely, where a measure does have trade-distorting effects or effects on production, it must be subject to reduction commitments, regardless of whether it complies with certain other basic or policy-specific criteria. To exempt a measure because a Member alleges that it is classified as a green box measure, despite having trade-distorting effects or effects on production, would be to accept a circular reasoning and would undoubtedly undermine the disciplines on domestic support measures.
39. Brazil has set forth the evidence demonstrating that production flexibility contracts and direct payments have more than a minimal effect on production and thus are inconsistent with the fundamental requirement of the first sentence of Annex 2, paragraph 1.54 These production effects are not surprising given the fact that both PFC and direct payments limit payments based on the type of
52 The New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary, 1993 edition, p. 2557. 53 The New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary, 1993 edition, p. 1042. 54 First Submission of Brazil, paras. 163-172; 183-191; First Oral Statement of Brazil, paras 50-54, 5761; Exhibit Bra-105 (Statement of Professor Daniel Sumner at the First Meeting of the Panel 22 July 2003, paras. 20-28).

production. Further, the updating of the base acreage for the direct payment programme (which one third of all eligible US farms took advantage of to increase their base acres eligible to receive direct payments), created further production enhancing effects today (as well as in the future) as detailed by Professor Sumner in paragraphs 20-29 of his Statement at the First Meeting of the Panel on 22 July 2003.55
40. Brazil finally notes that if follows from the first sentence of Annex 2, paragraph 1 that any domestic support measures not complying with one of the basic or policy-specific criteria in Annex 2 is to be presumed to violate the fundamental requirement that it have no, or at most minimal, tradedistorting effects or effects on production. This conclusion holds regardless of the finding of the Panel on the character of the first sentence of Annex 2, paragraph 1 as a stand-alone obligation.56
28. Please explain the meaning of the word "criteria" in Articles 6.1 and 7.1. What effect, if any, does the use of the word "Accordingly" in paragraph 1 of Annex 2 of the Agreement on Agriculture have on the meaning of the preceding sentence? BRA
Brazil's Answer:
41. Articles 6.1 and 7.1 reference "criteria" in general, without a specific mention of "basic criteria", or "policy-specific" criteria. To give meaning to the "fundamental requirement" of Annex 2, paragraph 1, the use of the word "criteria" must encompass all the rules, standards, or requirements established by Annex 2 as conditions for determining whether a domestic support measure can be exempted from reduction commitments. There is no basis, therefore, on which to exclude the fundamental requirement in Annex 2, paragraph 1 from the criteria that a domestic support measure must meet to be exempted from the reduction commitments.
42. Brazil further notes that, while Article 6.1 refers to "criteria set out in this Article", nowhere in the subsequent sub-paragraphs of Article 6 can the word "criteria" be found. This suggests that the term "criteria" as used in the Agreement on Agriculture cannot be interpreted in such a way as to limit its coverage to "basic criteria" or "policy-specific criteria" in Annex 2. The word "criterion" means "a principle, standard or test by which a thing is judged, assessed or identified".57 It follows that the term "criteria" encompasses all standards and tests set up by the provisions in the Agreement on Agriculture and its Annexes to which Article 6.1 and 7.1 refer. This standards and tests include the fundamental requirement in the first sentence of Annex 2, paragraph 1.
43. The word "accordingly" does not (and cannot be read to) emasculate a "fundamental requirement". It introduces the related but distinct obligation to conform to the basic and policyspecific criteria. "Accordingly" is defined as "in accordance with the logical premise". It is also defined as "harmoniously, agreeably," or "in natural sequence,"58 or "appropriate, fitting".59 The word "accordingly" indicates that the "basic criteria" are derivative of the more fundamental obligation in the first sentence of that same paragraph. "Accordingly" simply explains that because it is a fundamental requirement that domestic support measures have no, or at most minimal, tradedistorting effects or effects on production, it is necessary that the measures also meet certain basic criteria. Thus, the "fundamental requirement" is a premise, and the "basic criteria" in the second sentence of Annex 2, paragraph 1 are in accordance ­ i.e., not contrary ­ to that fundamental requirement. Because the first is a premise of the second, it is incorrect, indeed illogical, to say that the second sentence takes precedence, subsumes or subordinates the first more fundamental obligation.

30. Do the parties consider that direct payments and production flexibility contract payments meet or met the basic criteria referred to in paragraph 1 of Annex 2 of the Agreement on Agriculture? BRA, USA
Brazil's Answer:
44. The direct payments and production flexibility contract payments meet the first basic criteria in paragraph 1(a) of Annex 2. With respect to the second basic criteria, Brazil is not alleging that either of these two types of payments "have the effect of providing price support to producers".
31. If the first sentence of paragraph 1 of Annex 2 is not a stand-alone obligation, then must new, non- or minimally trade-distorting measures that do not conform to the criteria listed in Annex 2 be classified as non-Green Box? BRA, USA
Brazil's Answer:
45. Yes. As explained in answer to Question 27 above, any domestic support measures that do not comply with the basic or policy-specific criteria in Annex 2 shall be presumed to violate the fundamental requirement in the first sentence of paragraph 1 of Annex 2 and must, therefore, be considered non green-box domestic support measures. This is true regardless whether the Panel concludes that the first sentence of paragraph 1 of Annex 2 is a stand-alone obligation.

33. According to the United States' interpretation of the word "grant", when can a Member claim that a measure is not exempt from action under Article 13(b)? What if the measure is enacted annually? Can the Member obtain a remedy in respect of that measure under the DSU? USA
(34) Does Brazil interpret the word "grant" as used in Article 13(b)(ii) of the Agreement on Agriculture to mean payment made in a specific year or payment made in respect of a specific year? BRA
Brazil's Answer:
46. Brazil interprets the word "grant" to mean "payment made in respect of a specific year".60
35. Does a failure by a Member to comply in a given year with either the chapeau of Article 13(b) or the proviso in subparagraph (ii) of Article 13(b) impact its entitlement to benefit in an earlier or a later year from the exemption from action provided by Article 13(b)? BRA, USA
60 See First Oral Statement of Brazil, para. 31 ("Thus, the neutral term `decision' must be read consistently with `grant.' In sum, a harmonious interpretation of 'decided' exists where the `decision' is to fund marketing year 1992 non-`green-box' expenditures for a specific commodity.").

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-22
Brazil's Answer:
47. Yes. A failure of a Member's measures to meet in any given year the conditions of the peace clause lifts the entitlement to peace clause protection for the whole implementation period for all measures found to fail meeting the conditions of the peace clause. This conclusion applies to domestic support measures as well as export subsidies.
48. At the outset, Brazil would like to recall that the peace clause provides Members only limited protection from actionable and prohibited subsidy claims under the SCM Agreement and GATT Article XVI. Domestic support measures are only exempt from action under Articles 5 and 6 of the SCM Agreement and under GATT Article XVI:1, if the domestic support measures do not violate the Total AMS reduction commitments of a Member and if they do not grant support to a specific commodity in excess of that decided during the 1992 marketing year. Export subsidies are only exempt from actions under Articles 3, 5 and 6 of the SCM Agreement and GATT Article XVI, if they conform fully to the provisions of Part V of the Agreement on Agriculture.
49. The peace clause does not impose any positive obligations and can, thus, not be violated. It constitutes a right and defence of a Member that this Member may or may invoke. The US ­ FSC and US ­ FSC (21.5) dispute are examples of disputes, in which a Member has chosen not to invoke the peace clause defence. Brazil has demonstrated before, that the peace clause is in the nature of an affirmative defence.61 Accordingly, a complaining party does not bear the burden of proof that the measures at issue do not meet the conditions of the peace clause.
50. Nothing in the text of Article 13 suggests that a Member, which foregoes its peace clause exemption for particular measures in one year during the implementations period, shall be entitled to claim peace clause exemption for those measures for other ­ earlier or later ­ years. Article 13 offers peace clause exemption for measures that "fully conform" to Article 6 and that do not "grant support" "in excess of" that decided during the 1992 marketing year, as well as for measures that "fully conform" to Part V of the Agreement on Agriculture. If measures fail to meet one of the relevant conditions in any year ­ be it the current year or an earlier year during the implementation period ­ those measures can no longer be considered to "fully conform" or to not "grant support" "in excess of". Consequently, those measures are not exempt from action.
51. Finally, Brazil notes that the Panel need not decide this issue due to the circumstances of the present case. Brazil has demonstrated that the United States' domestic support measures at issue in this dispute do not meet the conditions of the peace clause in any marketing year from MY 1999 to the present and that the US export subsidies also do not conform fully to Part V of the Agreement on Agriculture. Thus, none of the subsidies at issue in this dispute is entitled to exemption from actions pursuant to the peace clause.
36. Does a failure by a Member to comply with Article 13(b) in respect of a specific commodity impact its entitlement to benefit in respect of other agricultural products from the exemption from action provided by Article 13(b)? BRA, USA
Brazil's Answer:
52. No. In fact, this is one of the purposes of the word "specific" in Article 13(b)(ii) ­ to differentiate a specific commodity whose amount of support was greater than the amount of support in marketing year 1992 from other specific commodities whose support may not have exceeded the 1992 marketing year level.
61 See First Submission of Brazil, para. 110-121, and First Oral Statement of Brazil, para. 5-11.

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-23
37. In the United States' view, why did the drafters not use the exact term "productspecific" in Article 13(b)(ii)? USA
38. Given the fact that subsidies available for more than one product could have various effects on production, how does the United States demarcate between product-specific support and non-product specific support ? USA
39. If "such measures" in Article 13(b)(ii) refers to all those in the chapeau of Article 13(b), why are they not all included in the potential comparisons with 1992? In what circumstances can measures which grant non-product specific support lose exemption from action under Articles 5 and 6 of the SCM Agreement and Article XVI of GATT 1994? USA
40. In relation to which other provisions in the Agreement on Agriculture is it relevant to disaggregate non-product specific support in terms of specific commodities? BRA
Brazil's Answer:
53. The Panel's question uses the phrase "non-product specific support", which is not defined explicitly in the Agreement on Agriculture. Therefore, before responding to this question, Brazil will set forth its understanding of what this term means and which measures at issue in this dispute fall within that definition.
54. "Aggregate Measurement of Support" and "AMS" are defined in Article 1(a) as the "annual level of support, expressed in monetary terms" (a) "in favour of the producers of the basic agricultural product" or (b) "non-product-specific support provided in favour of agricultural producers in general . . ." (emphasis added). Brazil notes that the ordinary meaning of the word "general" is "including, involving, or affecting all or nearly all the parts of a (specified or implied) whole."62 The "whole" in the case of Article 1(a) of the Agriculture Agreement refers to agricultural producers of all or nearly all basic agricultural products covered by the Agreement on Agriculture. Because the universe of domestic support measures includes either "product-specific" or "non-product-specific" domestic support measures, it follows that any domestic support that is not provided "in favour of agricultural producers in general" is deemed to be "in favour of the producers of the basic agricultural product". Accordingly, the test for determining whether a domestic support measure is "non-product specific" for the purpose of calculating AMS is whether, as a factual matter, the measure provides support to "agricultural producers in general".
55. The United States has argued that Article 1(a) is useful context for interpreting the meaning of "support to a specific commodity".63 However, the United States latches on to only the first part of Article 1(a), and ignores the "in general" qualification in the second part, which provides the essential meaning as to the scope of what is and is not "product-specific". Brazil notes that none of the measures it used to calculate the levels of support for purposes of Article 13(b)(ii) for MY 1992 or MY 1999-2002 could properly be deemed to be "non-product-specific" support as defined in Article 1(a) of the Agreement on Agriculture. And, as Brazil has previously argued, all of these measures are "support to" upland cotton within the meaning of Article 13(b)(ii).
56. With that introduction, the answer to the Panel's question is that Brazil is not aware of any provision of the Agreement on Agriculture requiring the dis-aggregation of support that is "provided in favour of agricultural producers in general", as discussed above. However, Brazil notes that Article 13(b)(ii) is a sui generis provision of the Agreement on Agriculture that does not use the phrases "AMS", "non-product specific" or "product-specific" support. Contrary to all of the other
62 The New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary, 1993 edition, p. 1073. 63 First Submission of the United States, para. 78; See also Closing Statement of the United States, para. 18 (ignoring "in general" language).

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-24
provisions of the Agreement on Agriculture, Article 13(b)(ii) alone addresses the process for disciplining domestic support provided to a specific commodity under Articles 5 and 6 of the SCM Agreement and Article XVI:1 of GATT 1994.
41. What is the position of Brazil with regard to certain other domestic support measures not cited by Brazil that were notified by the United States as non-product-specific (e.g. G/AG/N/USA/43), some of which presumably deliver support to upland cotton (e.g. state credit programmes, irrigation subsidies etc). Why have budgetary outlays for such measures related to upland cotton not been included in the comparison of support with 1992? BRA
Brazil's Answer:
57. Brazil did not include any other types of domestic support measures for MY 1992 or MY 1999-2002 in calculating peace clause amounts because no other measures appeared to meet the test of being non-green box "support to" upland cotton in Article 13(b)(ii). Similarly, these measures appear to meet the test of being provided "in favour of agricultural producers in general". None, of these other measures notified by the United States as non-product specific had any upland cotton specific link in terms of historic, updated, or present upland cotton acreage, present upland cotton production or prices, or upland cotton groups of insurance policies or any other specific upland cotton provisions. Further, the United States has not indicated in any documents that these state credit programmes, irrigation subsidies, etc. were not made available "in favour of agricultural producers in general". If the United States is able to provide such information, then it would be appropriate for the Panel to allocate such support to, inter alia, upland cotton. As detailed in Brazil's answer to Question 40, the United States was obligated to notify to the Committee on Agriculture and to allocate as "product-specific support" to upland cotton any domestic measure that did not provide support "in favour of agricultural producers in general. . .".
58. The only US domestic support measures that Brazil is aware of that would meet the test of being "support to upland cotton" are those that it listed for purposes of calculating the level of peace clause support in its First Written Submission.64 In the view of Brazil, these non-green box domestic support measures are the measures that constitute "support to" upland cotton for the purpose of Article 13(b).
42. If the word "specific" were deleted from Article 13(b)(ii), would this change the meaning of the subparagraph? BRA
Brazil's Answer:
59. Brazil believes that the meaning would change. The deletion of the word "specific" would create some ambiguity. The ordinary meaning of the phrase "a commodity" is "a thing that is an object of trade, esp. a raw material or agricultural crop". Therefore, the meaning of a commodity is rather broad and could for instance refer to "grains".65 While the term "grains" may refer to "a commodity," it cannot connate "a specific commodity". Specific commodities that make up the commodity "grains" would be wheat, barley, oats, rice etc. Thus, the use of the term "specific commodity" clarifies that the subject of Article 13(b)(ii) is support to specific, i.e., individual, commodities and that this provisions does not deal with groups of individual commodities such as grains.
64 First Submission of Brazil , paras. 144, 148, 149. 65 Also Annex 1 of the Agreement on Agriculture refers to some broad commodity categories such as "animal hair" and "essential oils." These would cover several specific commodities such as specific types of animal hair, or specific essential oils like jasmin oil or peppermint oil.

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-25
60. Further, the phrase "a specific commodity" also makes it clearer that the "commodity" at issue is equivalent to the "like product" as defined, inter alia, in the SCM Agreement. This parallel construction of the term "specific commodity" and "like product" is consistent with the fact that the peace clause provides a conditional exemption from Articles 5 and 6 of the SCM Agreement and Article XVI:1 of GATT 1994 ­ which require the examination of effects of subsidies on products "like" those receiving the subsidies.
43. What are the precise differences between deficiency payments and counter-cyclical payments that lead you to classify the former as product-specific and the latter as non-product specific? How do you classify market loss assistance payments? USA
44. Do you allege that counter-cyclical payments could be considered product-specific? BRA
Brazil's Answer:
61. Brazil notes its discussion of "non-product specific" and "product-specific" support in its Answers to Questions 40-41. For the purpose of calculating AMS, counter-cyclical payments (CCP) are "product-specific" support for two main reasons: (i) they are not "support provided in favour of agricultural producers in general", and (ii) they are directly linked to upland cotton-specific parameters (current prices and historical acreage and yield). Indeed, when the US 2002 FSRI Act was examined by the WTO Committee on Agriculture, the European Communities agreed with Brazil that CCP payments could not be considered "non-product-specific" support.66 New Zealand has taken a similar view in its Third Party Submission in this dispute.67
62. Brazil has provided extensive facts that upland cotton producers receive CCP payments as support to upland cotton and that such payments are support to upland cotton for the purposes of Article 13(b)(ii). These facts also support a finding that CCP payments are "product-specific" support. Further, Brazil notes the following facts demonstrating that counter-cyclical payments (and direct payments) are not provided "in favour of agricultural producers in general", but are instead provided to only a fraction of US agricultural production:
· CCP payments are made to holders of upland cotton base acreage when US upland cotton prices fall below 65.73 cents per pound. Producers/holders of all other farm acreage in the United States do not receive CCP payments when US upland cotton prices received by US producers fall. In MY 2001, (non-updated) upland cotton base acreage represented 1.7 percent of total US farmland.68
· CCP payments for upland cotton (and direct payments) are received by holders of upland cotton base acreage, i.e. for land that grew upland cotton between 1998-2001 or between
66 Exhibit Bra-144 (G/AG/R/31, para. 30) ("Brazil would not accept [CCP] classification as `nonproduct-specific payment'."); para 31 ("The EC also shared Brazil's analysis on how the counter-cyclical payments should be classified and pointed to US insurance programmes as not being properly classified at present").
67 Third Party Submission of New Zealand, para. 2.24 ("Accordingly, New Zealand considers that the United States incorrectly categorizes CCP payments as non-product specific support.").
68 In MY 2001, total US farmland was 959.163 million acres (See Exhibit Bra-143 (Agricultural Statistics 2003, USDA, Table 9.6). Average US upland cotton base acreage for MY 1997-2001 was 16.3 million acres (See Exhibit Bra-142 (Agricultural Outlook, USDA, May 2002, Table 19). Brazil has requested the United States to provide information on updated base acreage for the CCP and direct payment programme in questions during consultations and in the Annex V proceedings. Brazil has not received that information and, therefore, uses 16.3 million acreage as a proxy for the direct payment base acreage noting that USDA reports that more than 99 percent of eligible acreage signed up for the CCP and direct payment programme (Exhibit Bra-44 ("Direct Payment and CCP Enrollment Report," USDA, 19 June 2003).

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-26
1993-1995. USDA reported in 2001 that the 1997 census showed there were 31,500 upland cotton farms. Assuming no increase in the number of US upland cotton farms since 1997, this represents 1.46 percent of all farms in the United States.69
· Upland cotton cash receipts as a percentage of total cash receipts from all agricultural commodities was 2.5 percent in MY 1999, 2.35 percent in MY 2000, and 3.05 percent in MY 2001.70
· The 10 "programme" crops in the CCP (and direct payment) programme represented only 23.49 per cent of total farm cash receipts from all agricultural commodities on average between MY 1997-2001.71
· The base acreage of the 10 "programme" crops in the CCP (and direct payment) programme represented only 30 percent of total US farm acreage in MY 2001.72
· In MY 2002, CCP payments to holders of upland cotton base acreage represented approximately 80 percent ­ or $1.143 billion ­ of total CCP payments ($1.420 billion) for the ten eligible programme crops.73
· In MY 2002, no CCP payments were made to holders of 8 of the 10 eligible crops. In particular, holders of base acreage for barley, corn, grain sorghum, oats, soybeans, other oilseeds, and wheat received no CCP payments.74
· CCP base acreage receiving CCP payments in MY 2002 (upland cotton and rice base acreage) represented only 2.2 percent of total US farmland.75
· 90 percent of US acreage eligible to receive upland cotton CCP payments for upland cotton is located in only 10 out of 50 US states, with the top 5 US States accounting for 66 percent of US upland cotton production.76 Thus, upland cotton CCP payments are focused on farms in a limited number of US States (i.e., the "cotton belt").
69 Exhibit Bra-143 (Agricultural Statistics 2003, USDA, Table 9-9). There were 2.155 million farms in the United States in 2001. USDA reported that in 1997, there were 31,500 farms that grew cotton. Exhibit Bra46 ("Cotton: Background and Issues for Farm Legislation," USDA, July 2001, p. 2).
70 Exhibit Bra-142 (Agricultural Outlook, USDA, May 2002, p. 59). The calculations cited above were derived from comparing upland cotton cash receipts compared to total commodity cash receipts net of government payments.
71 Exhibit Bra-145 (US and State Farm Income Data (United States and States 1997-2001), USDA, Table 5).
72 Brazil does not have access to actual CCP base acreage figures. Therefore, Brazil has used MY 2001 figures as a proxy and relies on MY 2001 PFC base acreage for the 7 crops covered by PFC payments (Exhibit Bra-142 (Agricultural Outlook, USDA, May 2002, p. 50) and has added MY 2001 soybean, peanut and other oilseed acreage (Exhibit Bra-146 (Acreage, NASS, 28 June 2002, p. 14, 15 and 17) (286.8 million acres). Total US farmland in 2001 was 959,163,331 million acres (Exhibit Bra-143 (Agricultural Statistics 2003, USDA, Table 9.6).
73 Exhibit Bra-147 ("Estimate of Support Granted by Commodity via Counter-Cyclical Payments"). 74 Exhibit Bra-147 ("Estimate of Support Granted by Commodity via Counter-Cyclical Payments"). 75 Upland cotton and rice PFC base acreage represented 16.2 and 4.1 million acres (Exhibit Bra-142 (Agricultural Outlook, USDA, May 2002, p. 50)). Brazil does not have any information on the effects of the base acreage update and, therefore, uses the PFC base acreage as a proxy for CCP base acreage. Total US farmland in 2001 was 959,163,331 million acres (Exhibit Bra-143 (Agricultural Statistics 2003, USDA, Table 9.6). 76 Exhibit Bra-107 ("US and State Farm Income Data, Farm Cash Receipts," ERS, USDA, June 2003).

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-27
63. This evidence demonstrates that CCP (and direct payments) are provided to only a fraction of the producers of agricultural commodities in the United States and that payments are focused to producers of a limited number agricultural products. In view of these facts ­ particularly that upland cotton has its own "target price" of 72.4 cents per pound and accounted for 80 percent of all CCP payments in MY 2002 ­ it is appropriate for the Panel to consider only upland cotton statistics to conclude that these payments are "support to cotton" and are also "product-specific".
64. But even if the Panel relies on data regarding all 10 CCP programme crops, the evidence still demonstrates that CCP and direct payments are "support to cotton" and "product-specific" support because they are not provided to producers of US agricultural commodities "in general". Only around 30 percent of the farm acreage in the United States is farmed by producers with the possibility of receiving CCP payments.77 In MY 2002, only 2.2 percent of total US farmland was eligible to receive CCP payments.78 In light of these facts, it is not surprising that the EC correctly recognized in June 2002 that the US CCP programme does not represent a domestic support programme "provided in favour of agricultural producers in general".79
45. If the Panel considered that Step 2 payments paid to exporters were an export subsidy, would the United States count them as domestic support measures for the purposes of Article 13(b)? Please verify Brazil's separate data for Step 2 export payments and Step 2 domestic payments in Exhibit BRA-69 or provide separate data. BRA, USA
Brazil's Answer:
65. Brazil can verify that the Step 2 information its representatives received and that is tabulated in Exhibit Bra-69 was obtained from Wayne Bjorlie (wayne_bjorlie@wdc.usda.gov) in the Kansas City Commodity Office (KCCO) upon request for such data in December 2002.
46. What is the relevance, if any, of the concept of "specificity" in Article 2 of the SCM Agreement and references to "a product" or "subsidized product" in certain provisions of the SCM Agreement to the meaning of "support to a specific commodity" in Article 13(b)(ii) Agreement on Agriculture? BRA, USA
Brazil's Answer:
66. The concept of "specificity" in Article 2 of the SCM Agreement is useful context in interpreting the meaning of "support to a specific commodity" in Article 13(b)(ii). As the United States recognized at the First Meeting of the Panel with the parties, the word "support" as used in the Agreement on Agriculture is a synonym for "subsidy".80 The term "support to a specific commodity" has a similar meaning as "subsidized product," as used in, inter alia, Article 6.3(c) of the
77 Brazil does not have access to actual CCP base acreage figures. Therefore, Brazil has used MY 2001 figures as a proxy and relies on MY 2001 PFC base acreage for the 7 crops covered by PFC payments (Exhibit Bra-142 (Agricultural Outlook, USDA, May 2002, p. 50) and has added MY 2001 soybean, peanut and other oilseed acreage (Exhibit Bra-146 (Acreage, NASS, 28 June 2002, p. 14, 15 and 17) (286.8 million acres). Total US farmland in 2001 was 959,163,331 million acres (Exhibit Bra-143 (Agricultural Statistics 2003, USDA, Table 9.6).
78 Upland cotton and rice PFC base acreage represented 16.2 and 4.1 million acres (Exhibit Bra-142 (Agricultural Outlook, USDA, May 2002, p. 50)). Brazil does not have any information on the effects of the base acreage update and, therefore, uses the PFC base acreage as a proxy for CCP base acreage. Total US farmland in 2001 was 959,163,331 million acres (Exhibit Bra-143 (Agricultural Statistics 2003, USDA, Table 9.6).
79 Exhibit Bra-144 (G/AG/R/31, paras. 30-31). 80 Brazil does not mean to imply that in the second phase of this proceeding it will not have the burden of demonstrating that each of the domestic support programs are "subsidies" within the meaning of the SCM Agreement.

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-28
SCM Agreement. Given the textual similarities between "subsidized product" and "support to a specific commodity", assessment of whether "support to a specific product" exists could be examined with at least some reference to the specificity criteria of Article 2 of the SCM Agreement. Article 2 of the SCM Agreement provides, in relevant part:
2.1 In order to determine whether a subsidy, as defined in paragraph 1 of Article 1, is specific to an enterprise or industry or group of enterprises or industries (referred to in this Agreement as "certain enterprises") within the jurisdiction of the granting authority, the following principles shall apply:
(a) Where the granting authority, or the legislation pursuant to which the granting authority operates, explicitly limits access to a subsidy to certain enterprises, such subsidy shall be specific.. . .
(c) If, notwithstanding any appearances of non-specificity resulting from the application of the principles laid down in subparagraphs (a) and (b), there are reasons to believe that the subsidy may in fact be specific, other factors may be considered. Such factors are: use of the subsidy programme by a limited number of certain enterprises, predominant use by certain enterprises, the granting of disproportionally large amounts of subsidy to certain enterprises . . .
2.2 A subsidy which is limited to certain enterprises within a designated geographical region within the jurisdiction of the granting authority shall be specific.
67. The US Statement of Administrative Action ("SAA") describes in some detail how the United States intends to administer the specificity provisions, suggesting that the US Department of Commerce applies a low threshold for finding both "de jure" and "de facto" specificity:
The Administration intends to apply the specificity test in light of its original purpose, which is to function as an initial screening mechanism to winnow out only those foreign subsidies which truly are broadly available and widely used throughout an economy.81
Brazil agrees with this statement that the "original purpose" of the specificity criterion is to make subsidies non-specific only when they are broadly available and widely used throughout an economy.
68. The ordinary meaning of the plural term "certain enterprises," as set out in the chapeau to ASCM Article 2.1, underscores that a subsidy can be specific even if it applies to a "group of . . . industries." The term "industry" is defined as "a particular form or branch of productive labour; a trade, a manufacture".82 Thus, the text of the chapeau supports the notion that for a subsidy to be specific under the SCM Agreement it must be limited to a certain number of industries that may be involved in different trades or manufacturing processes.
69. The object and purpose of the specificity requirement in Article 2.1(a) of the SCM Agreement is consistent with a broad scope for specificity. One key purpose for the specificity requirement is to avoid the countervailability of those subsidies widely available in an economy, while at the same time ensuring that those subsidies that benefit some groups of industries or enterprises more than others are covered. As the United States noted in the SAA:
The specificity test was intended to function as a rule of reason and to avoid the imposition of countervailing duties in situations where, because of the widespread
81See Exhibit Bra-148 ("Statement of Administrative Action," p. 929) (emphasis added). 82 The New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary, 1993 edition, p. 1356.

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-29
availability and use of a subsidy, the benefit of the subsidy is spread throughout an economy. Conversely, the specificity test was not intended to function as a loophole through which narrowly focused subsidies provided to or used by discrete segments of an economy could escape the purview of the CVD law.83
70. Therefore, the ordinary meaning, context and object and purpose of Article 2.1(a) of the SCM Agreement confirm that subsidies that are available to discrete segments of an economy or to only particular industries are specific. Under these standards, each of the subsidies challenged by Brazil in this dispute (and listed as support for the purposes of the peace clause analysis) are provided to "discrete segments" of the US economy. Indeed, they are provided to discrete segments of the subsection of the US economy known as "agriculture". Thus, if the Panel were to apply the specificity standard set out in Article 2 of the SCM Agreement to Article 13(b)(ii) of the Agreement on Agriculture, the identified domestic support subsidies would be considered "specific".
71. Brazil notes that further support for the use of specificity concepts from the SCM Agreement in interpreting Article 13(b)(ii) of the Agriculture Agreement is found in the definition of "AMS" in Article 1(a) of the Agriculture Agreement. The definition of "non-product specific" support ("support provided in favour of agricultural producers in general") illustrates that the concept of specificity in the context of the SCM Agreement and of AMS in the Agreement on Agriculture are similar. Both would require a finding of specificity unless support is provided to an economy generally, in the case of the SCM Agreement, or to "producers" of agricultural commodities "in general," in the case of AMS under the Agriculture Agreement.
72. In contrast, the United States seeks to apply an extremely restricted concept of specificity to the peace clause that begins and ends with the question whether production of a specific commodity is required to receive the payment. This is one of the "policy-specific" criteria of a "green box" test in Annex 2, paragraph 6, but not the test of "support to a specific commodity" required by Article 13(b)(ii). Further, as demonstrated above, this narrow US interpretation finds no support in the provisions of the SCM Agreement and the Agreement on Agriculture that speak to specificity.
4. "in excess of that decided during the 1992 marketing year"
47. Where does Article 13(b)(ii) require a year-on-year comparison? BRA, USA
Brazil's Answer:
73. The text of Article 13(b)(ii) sets up a comparison between the "support" "grant[ed]" during the implementation period with support "decided" during the 1992 marketing year. Brazil cannot conceive of a methodology in which all support granted during the entire implementation period could be compared with the support decided during marketing year 1992. In order to generate an "apples to apples" ("support to support") comparison, it is necessary to compare the support granted in any marketing year during the implementation period with the support decided during marketing year 1992. No other reading of Article 13(b)(ii) would permit the required comparison.
74. Additionally, Brazil notes that the second condition for domestic support measures to be exempted from actions under the SCM Agreement is that a Member's domestic support measures conform fully to Article 6, and, thus, grant support within the limits of that Member's Total AMS reduction commitments. These Total AMS reduction commitments are made on a yearly basis. The nature of the reduction commitment and the manner, in which compliance with Article 6 is determined, demonstrates that Article 13(b)(ii) ­ read in accordance with its chapeau and the reference to Article 6 therein ­ requires a year-by-year comparison. The context of the chapeau provides support for Brazil's argument made above that the relevant comparison for Article 13(b)(ii)
83 Exhibit Bra-148 (Statement of Administrative Action, p. 930).

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-30
involves a comparison of support granted in any of the marketing years during the implementation period with support decided in MY 1992.
75. Similarly, Article 13(c) provides further context to support the conclusion that Article 13(b)(ii) requires a year-by-year comparison. Brazil notes in its answer to Question 7, that export subsidy reduction commitments under the Agreement on Agriculture are made on a commodity-specific basis. Brazil has also pointed out in its answer to Question 79 that a violation of Part V of the Agreement on Agriculture, and the resulting loss of peace clause exemption, must also be assessed on a yearly basis.
48. Does Article 13(b)(ii) require a comparison of support granted with support decided? How could such a comparison be made? BRA, USA
Brazil's Answer:
76. The answer to the first question is yes, the text of Article 13(b)(ii) requires a comparison between the "support granted" for marketing years between 1995-2003 with the "support decided" in marketing year 1992. Brazil has explained in detail in its First Oral Statement the basis for this legal conclusion.84
77. The second question asks how the comparison must be made. Brazil is of the view that a harmonious interpretation of "support decided" with "support granted" requires an examination of the expenditures incurred for all of the support related to the 1992 marketing year and each of the marketing years during the implementation period ending 1 January 2004. This expenditure approach permits an objective, easily verifiable approach to compare the support for each of the two time periods. That is particularly important when, as in this case, there are a wide variety of programmes that do not provide support on a "cents per pound" basis to all production. Brazil does not consider that a comparison based on a "rate of support" approach as suggested by the United States allows the same objective and easily verifiable comparison. Professor Sumner explained the difficulty of comparing, on a "cents per pound" basis, deficiency payments, Step 2, marketing loans, and crop insurance provided in marketing year 1992 with the marketing year 1999-2002 measures that replaced or changed the 1992 measures.85 Nevertheless, Professor Sumner was able, through a relatively complex methodology, to calculate and compare a level of support on a per pound basis between marketing year 1992 and marketing years 1999-2002.
78. Another methodology is the rate of support taking into account expenditures, as detailed in Brazil's answer to Question 60 infra. Brazil would note that a last methodology that would have been possible, had the text of Article 13(b)(ii) included the term "AMS," would be to calculate support based on the criteria set forth in Annex 3 of the Agriculture Agreement. The results of this calculation are set forth in Brazil's answer to Question 67 infra.
49. Brazil claims that the terms "grant" and "decided" in Article 13(b)(ii) have broadly the same meaning. If so, why did the drafters not use the same term? BRA

Brazil's Answer:
79. Brazil set forth its interpretation of the terms "grant" and "decided" in its First Oral Statement.86 Brazil concluded that the text, context, and object and purpose of Article 13(b)(ii) meant that the MY 1992 "decision" must be related to "support granted" in order to make possible the comparison between MY 1992 and marketing years during the implementation period. Yet, Brazil does not believe that the "decision" in marketing year 1992 means that all of the support had to be "granted" (i.e., paid) during the 12-month period of that single marketing year. Rather, the decision had to authorize payment in respect of a specific marketing year, including MY 1992.87 However, a Member could have decided during the 1992 marketing year to budget a certain amount of support to specific commodities for the next several marketing years, including MY 1995 et seq. In that case, the relevant peace clause comparison would involve comparing the support granted to a specific commodity in any marketing year during the implementation period to what was decided during the 1992 marketing year to be provided for that later marketing year.
80. Brazil has cited the negotiating history of Article 13(b)(ii), which indicates that the EC insisted on the use of the word "decided" to obtain a safe harbour for the total quantity of its domestic support subsidies that it had already budgeted in marketing year 1992 for marketing year 1995 and thereafter.88 Brazil will comment further, as required, on the intentions of the "drafters" following receipt of the answers of the European Communities and the United States.
50. Please provide any written drafting history which could shed light on why the proviso was added to what is now Article 13(b)(ii) and, in particular, why both words "grant" and "decided" were used. USA
51. Could the United States please comment on the interpretation advanced by the EC, in paragraphs 16 and 18 of its oral statement, of the words "decided during the 1992 marketing year"? USA
52. Please comment on an interpretation of the words "decided during" in Article 13(b)(ii) that would read them as synonymous with the words "authorized during". BRA, USA
Brazil's Answer:
81. Brazil agrees that in its proper context, the term "decided during" in Article 13(b)(ii) is synonymous with the words "authorized during". Brazil has set forth the reasoning and citations supporting this conclusion in its Answers to Question 49 supra and Question 58 infra, as well as in its First Oral Statement at paragraph 31.
53. Assume, for arguments sake, that the only "decision" made in the United States in 1992 was the target price. How would Brazil make the comparison vis-à-vis, for example, the year 2001? BRA
Brazil's Answer:
82. Brazil maintains that the relevant comparison under Article 13(b)(ii) is to compare expenditures incurred relating to MY 1992 with expenditures incurred relating to marketing years during the implementation period. Only this methodology allows for a comparison irrespective of the nature and characteristics of the domestic support measures provided and does not suffer from the
86 First Oral Statement of Brazil, paras. 27-34 87 Brazil and the United States appear to agree that MY 1992 is the relevant marketing year for purposes of this dispute. 88 First Submission of Brazil, para. 140.

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-32
shortcomings of other approaches, on which Brazil will comment below. In particular only an expenditure incurred approach allows for an effective comparison in the following situation: Assume, a Member introduces a payment that is made at a fixed rate per pound and is paid for each pound of actual upland cotton production. In this situation, it would be difficult to compare this domestic support measure, which is completely unrelated to market prices to a domestic support measure decided by a Member in MY 1992 and which sets a target price and provides price support.
83. With this qualification in mind, Brazil's understanding of this question is that the assumed single "decision" was the establishment of a target price of 72.9 cents per pound for eligible US upland cotton production during MY 1992. The assumed single "decision" on a target price of 72.9 cents per pound comprised of many other sub-decisions on the mandatory acreage reduction programme, on the operation of the 50/92-programme option, and on optional flex acres, among others.89 Professor Sumner has analyzed in detail the process through which such a target price of support could be compared to the support provided in MY 1999-2002.90 For MY 1992, he found that the estimated per unit support rates for all programs was 60.41 cents per pound. For MY 2001, he found the per unit support rates for all programmes was 66.51 cents per pound. Brazil refers to Professor Sumner's detailed description of the methodology he used to make these calculations.91
84. The irrationality of the simplistic "72.9 is greater than 51.92" approach by the United States is revealed by comparing it with the results of Professor Sumner taking into account in the calculation of the "rate of support" eligibility criteria and the costs imposed by participation in the US upland cotton support programs. It is also demonstrated by comparing the expenditures in MY 1992 ($1.9 billion) with the expenditures in MY 2001 ($4 billion).
54. Please identify all United States legal and regulatory and administrative instruments decided during the marketing year 1992, with the respective dates of decision, that decided support for upland cotton. BRA, USA
Brazil's Answer:
85. Brazil will comment further upon receipt of the answer provided by the United States to this question. The United States obviously has access to records related to all the decisions taken by the United States concerning its support programs for MY 1992. However, Brazil notes that given its understanding of the operation of the US support programmes, the United States took a number of decisions with respect to the upland cotton support programmes for MY 1992.
86. Many of the US support programmes for MY 1992 were decided by Title V of the Food, Agriculture, Conservation and Trade (FACT) Act of 1990 (P.L. 101-624), which established US farm policy for the 5 crop years 1991/92-1995/96, and by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (OBRA) of 1990 (P.L. 101-508), which established several programme provisions in order to reduce programme costs. Brazil considers that among the decisions taken by the United States in relation to MY 1992 upland cotton support programmes were the following:
· Continuation of the upland cotton target price under the deficiency payment programme at the 1990 level of 72.9 cents per pound set by the 1990 FACT Act. The OBRA limited the maximum payment acreage at 85 percent of the crop acreage minus the acreage reduction programme requirement, which was set annually. Therefore, the United States had to take a decision with respect to the MY 1992 percentage of deficiency programme
89 For a more thorough discussion of the decisions Brazil understands the United States has taken with respect to MY 1992, see Brazil's answer to Question 54.
90 See Exhibit Bra-105 (Statement of Professor Daniel Sumner at the First Meeting of the Panel). 91 Annex 2 to Exhibit Bra-105 (Statement of Professor Daniel Sumner at the First Meeting of the Panel).

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-33
base acreage that would be required to be set aside under the acreage reduction programme.
· In connection with the former, the United States also took a decision allowing producers to plant up to 25 percent of upland cotton acreage base, the so-called "flex acreage," to any commodity except fruits and vegetables and mung beans.
· Furthermore, the United States had to decide on how to implement the 50/92-programme option under the deficiency payment program.
· The United States also needed to determine the upland cotton acreage base for purposes of the deficiency payment programme, which for MY 1992 represents the previous threeyear average of planted and considered planted upland cotton acreage.
· Concerning the deficiency payment program, the United States finally had to decide on the payment rate for upland cotton.
· Concerning the marketing loan programme, the United States had to take a decision setting the marketing loan rate for upland cotton.
· Furthermore, the United States had to establish a weekly "adjusted world price" and, thus, the repayment rate for marketing loans determining the rate of marketing loan gains or loan deficiency payments.
· Furthermore, the United States took a weekly decision in MY 1992 with respect to the Step 2 payment rate applicable for that week.
· Regarding crop insurance, the Federal Crop Insurance Act of 1980 was the authorizing legislation, but it was necessary to adopt decisions concerning individual insurance policies that would apply to upland cotton and to set the respective rates of premium subsidies.
87. While Brazil does not consider this list to be exhaustive, it gives the Panel an overview on the variety of decisions the United States had to take to make the support programme to upland cotton operational. Brazil looks forward to the answer provided by the United States and reserves its right to comment as appropriate.
55. Please provide a copy of the instrument in which the rate of support for upland cotton during the marketing year 1992 was decided, indicating the date of the decision. USA
56. Could the United States please explain how support granted under legislation that dates back to 1990 can have been support "decided during the marketing year 1992"? USA
57. If the United States decided on a rate of support for MY1992, does that not mean that it decided on whatever budgetary outlay was required to meet that rate of support, even if the exact amount was not known at that time? USA
58. Please comment on the argument advanced by the EC, in paragraph 17 of its oral statement that: "Had WTO Members intended a limitation to the support provided or granted in 1992 the word 'for' would have been used in place of 'during'." BRA

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-34
Brazil's Answer:
88. Brazil agrees with the EC that the word "during" does not mean that all of the support need be provided or granted within the 12-month period of marketing year 1992. Rather, the decision must have been related to the amount of support to be granted in respect of marketing year 1992. This interpretation is consistent with an expenditure methodology that compares expenditures for upland cotton in respect of MY 1992 with expenditures for upland cotton in MY 1995-2003, and thereby permits a comparison of 1992 levels of support with levels of support in marketing years 1995-2003.
89. The negotiating history cited by Brazil in its First Submission indicates that the EC is in a special situation vis-à-vis the peace clause.92 It apparently made the decision in marketing year 1992 to budget an amount of support for commodities for marketing years 1995-2000 in its CAP reform. Brazil agrees with the EC that Article 13(b)(ii) was "intended to set up as a benchmark an amount of support adopted by some form of decision (be it political, legislative or administrative) in which support for a specific product is decided . . ." But the EC qualifies this assertion with the notion that that decision can only be "allocated for future years."93 This qualification would appear to be compelled by the EC's particular situation. But that situation does not justify the EC's conclusion that its "future years" concept means that Article 13(b)(ii) "clearly is not intended to set up a comparison between domestic support granted in 1992 and domestic support granted in a more recent period."
90. The notion of a "decision" suggests that individual Members each made some sort of a decision with respect to the peace clause. The United States and Brazil agree that the decision made by the United States ­ whatever it may have been ­ related to the level of support provided to upland cotton in MY 1992. Brazil's argument with the United States concerns the type of decision and the methodology that can be used to account for the level of support decided during MY 1992.
59. Should the rate of support as indicated in Article 13(b)(ii) include the market price? If so, why is it appropriate to include it in the comparison under Article 13(b)(ii)? BRA, USA
Brazil's Answer:
91. The most natural measure of support is budgetary expenditures, and these implicitly include market price in the sense that, for several US upland cotton programs, higher market prices lead to lower budgetary outlays. The US Government payments under the marketing loan, deficiency and counter-cyclical programs all decline with increasing market prices, as they cover the difference between the loan rate or the target price and the market price. Step 2 payments are also related to market prices in that they cover the difference between the A-Index and the lowest-priced US quote for upland cotton and, therefore, vary with market prices.94 Incorporating the different degrees to which the market price influences the support provided by the US Government to its upland cotton farmers is best achieved by looking at the results in terms of budgetary outlays for the programs. This measure of support is straightforward to apply and allows a ready and accurate comparison between 1992 and subsequent marketing years.
92. Under the US approach and Professor Sumner's adaptation of the US approach, market prices enter the calculation of the "rate of support" in the sense that the expected rate of support from the loan rate and the target price per eligible unit of production includes revenue expected to be received from the market (expected market price) and revenue expected from the US Government (subsidies). The market price enters inversely in the sense that the outlay is inversely related to the market price, as for instance the loan rate benefits make up the difference between the loan rate and the adjusted
92 First Submission of Brazil, para. 140. 93 Oral Statement of the European Communities, 24 July, para. 18. 94 Brazil notes, however, that the relationship between market price and level of Step 2 payments by the US Government is not as straightforward and positively correlated as for the other price-based programmes.

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-35
world price for the eligible share of production.95 The higher the market price, the higher the resulting budgetary outlays.
93. Additionally, there is one further important reason why the notion of support in Article 13(b)(ii) should include the market price. Without reference to the market price, it is impossible to say what the rate of support means to farmers. It may be that the support is completely irrelevant, because market prices are much higher than the loan rate or the target prices set by the US Government. For instance, the loan rate was irrelevant for US upland cotton producers in MY 19941996,96 because market prices were so high that no payments occurred. However, under essentially the same program, market loan benefits amounted to 26.6 cents per pound in MY 2001.97 Thus, without taking market prices into account, it is impossible to translate a "rate of support" into actual support provided and to give meaning to the term "support."
60. Can you provide information on support decided in 1992 and the years with which you believe it should be compared, on a per support programme / per unit of production / per annum basis? If possible, please specify how, if at all, budget outlays may be transposed into units of production, and which units of production are best to use. BRA, USA
Brazil's Answer:
94. Brazil maintains that the appropriate measure of support decided during MY 1992 is total actual expenditures resulting from any decisions regarding support to upland cotton. This must then be compared to total actual expenditures for support to upland cotton for MY 1999, 2000, 2001 and 2002. Presenting expenditures as a "rate of support" per pound of upland cotton disguises the fact that US expenditures for upland cotton have increased considerably since MY 1992. This is due to the fact that the increased US expenditures are now spread over an also increased US production. Therefore, a "rate of support" based on budgetary outlays or expenditure understates the real increase in US support to upland cotton. However, even disregarding the underestimation of the amount spent for upland cotton by presenting the budgetary outlays in the form of support per pound of actual upland cotton production, the data presented below show that also this measurement demonstrates that the US support in MY 1999-2002 is higher in each year than it was in MY 1992.
95. In answering this question, and responding to the Panel's requests, Brazil presents the support provided by the various US support programmes for a given marketing year on a per pound of actual upland cotton production basis. This approach takes into account market prices. Thus, the "support level" from deficiency payments, from the marketing loan programme and from counter-cyclical and Step 2 payments no longer reflects the "target price" approach favoured by the United States, but reflects actual payments made per unit of actual production.
96. Brazil believes that the unit of production that should be used is a pound of upland cotton actually produced in the United States for that marketing year in question. US support programmes provide support based on actual production (marketing loan programme, Step 2 and cottonseed payments), actual acres planted (crop insurance), updated historical production and current prices (deficiency payments and counter-cyclical payments), historical production (PFC, market loss assistance), and finally, updated historical production (direct payments). The most natural comparison on a per unit basis is to use actual production. The US National Cotton Council also calculates the support provided by all of these programmes to its upland cotton producer members in "cents per pound" of actual production.98 This reflects the reality that an upland cotton farmer

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-36

seeking to remain in business must calculate whether the amount of government support plus market revenue compensates for the cost of production incurred by producing a pound of upland cotton.

97. Brazil arrives at the figures presented in the following table by dividing the total annual amount of budgetary outlays to upland cotton from a US support programme by the total amount of production of upland cotton in the relevant marketing year.

_______________________
1 Deficiency payment per pound of actual production = deficiency payment expenditure / (total production [bales] * 480

[pounds/per bale]). Total deficiency payments in MY 1992 were $1.0174 billion, while total production was 15,71 million

bales (Exhibit Bra-4 ("Fact Sheet: Upland Cotton", USDA, January 2003, p. 4-6)). One bale equals 480 pound of upland

cotton. 2 PFC payment per pound of actual production = PFC payment expenditure for upland cotton base * (actual upland cotton

acreage / PFC upland cotton base acreage) / (total production [bales] * 480 [pounds/per bale]). Total PFC payments to

upland cotton are taken from Exhibit Bra-4 ("Fact Sheet: Upland Cotton," USDA, January 2003, p. 6). This amount has

been adjusted by the ratio of upland cotton acres actually planted (Exhibit Bra-4 ("Fact Sheet: Upland Cotton," USDA,

January 2003, p. 4)) to upland cotton base acres in the PFC programme (Exhibit Bra-142 (Agricultural Outlook, May 2002,

p. 50)). This adjustment is necessary because only the portion of upland cotton PFC payments that actually benefits acres

planted to upland cotton can be considered support to upland cotton. Because the latter figure is higher than the former, this

leads to a reduction in the payment rate reflecting actual production in each year. Total production is taken from Exhibit Bra-

4 ("Fact Sheet: Upland Cotton," USDA, January 2003, p. 4). 3 Market loss assistance payment per pound of actual production = Market loss assistance expenditure for upland cotton base

* (actual upland cotton acreage / PFC upland cotton base acreage) / (total production [bales] * 480 [pounds/per bale]). Total

market loss assistance payments to upland cotton are taken from Exhibit Bra-4 ("Fact Sheet: Upland Cotton", USDA,

January 2003, p. 6). This amount has been adjusted by the ratio of upland cotton acres actually planted (Exhibit Bra-4 ("Fact Sheet: Upland Cotton," USDA, January 2003, p. 4)) to upland cotton base acres in the PFC programme (Exhibit Bra-142

(Agricultural Outlook, May 2002, p. 50)). This adjustment is necessary because only the portion of upland cotton market loss assistance payments that actually benefits acres planted to upland cotton can be considered support to upland cotton.

Because the latter figure is higher than the former, this leads to a reduction in the payment rate. Total production is taken from Exhibit Bra-4 ("Fact Sheet: Upland Cotton", USDA, January 2003, p. 4).

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-37
4 Direct payments per pound actually produced = total direct payment expenditure for upland cotton base * (actual upland cotton acreage/direct payment upland cotton base acreage) / (total production [bales] * 480 [pounds/per bale]). Total direct payments for MY 2002 have been re-estimated from the figure presented by Brazil in its First Submission, para. 59. The new figure is based on the statutory payment rate of 6.67 cents per pound of upland cotton base multiplied by the direct payment upland cotton base acreage of 16.3 million acres (Brazil has assumed it to be the previous 5-year average as reported by USDA in Exhibit Bra-142 (Agricultural Outlook, May 2002, p. 50)) multiplied by the direct payment yield of 604 pounds per acre (Brazil has assumed it to be the previous 5-year average as reported by USDA in Exhibit Bra-142 (Agricultural Outlook, May 2002, p. 50)). Payments are made on 85 percent of base acres. This translates into a total of $558.17 million. This amount has been adjusted by the ratio of upland cotton acres actually planted Exhibit Bra-4 ("Fact Sheet: Upland Cotton," USDA, January 2003, p. 4) to upland cotton base acres in the direct payment program. Because the latter figure is higher than the former, this leads to a reduction in the direct payment rate. This adjustment is necessary because only the portion of upland cotton market loss assistance payments that actually benefits acres planted to upland cotton can be considered support to upland cotton. Total production is taken from Exhibit Bra-4 ("Fact Sheet: Upland Cotton", USDA, January 2003, p. 4). 5 Counter-cyclical payments per pound actually produced = total counter-cyclical payment expenditure for upland cotton base * (actual upland cotton acreage / counter-cyclical payment upland cotton base acreage) / (total production [bales] * 480 [pounds/per bale]). Total counter-cyclical payments for MY 2002 have been re-estimated from the figure presented by Brazil in its First Submission, para. 69. The new figure is based on the MY 2002 payment rate of 13.73 cents per pound of upland cotton base multiplied by the counter-cyclical payment upland cotton base acreage of 16.3 million acres (Brazil has assumed it to be the previous 5-year average as reported by USDA in Exhibit Bra-142 (Agricultural Outlook, May 2002, p. 50)) multiplied by the counter-cyclical payment yield of 604 pounds per acre (Brazil has assumed it to be the previous 5year average as reported by USDA in Exhibit Bra-142 (Agricultural Outlook, May 2002, p. 50) Brazil notes that this underestimates the payments, as it disregards the yield update for purposes of the counter-cyclical payments). Payments are made on 85 percent of base acres. This translates into a total of $1,148.98 million. This amount has been adjusted by the ratio of upland cotton acres actually planted Exhibit Bra-4 ("Fact Sheet: Upland Cotton," USDA, January 2003, p. 4) to upland cotton base acres in the counter-cyclical payment programme. Because the latter figure is higher than the former, this leads to a reduction in the direct payment rate. This adjustment is necessary because only the portion of upland cotton market loss assistance payments that actually benefits acres planted to upland cotton can be considered support to upland cotton. Total production is taken from Exhibit Bra-4 ("Fact Sheet: Upland Cotton", USDA, January 2003, p. 4). 6 Marketing loan benefit per pound of actual production = total marketing loan expenditures / (total production [bales] * 480 [pounds/per bale]). Total marketing loan payments (marketing loan gains plus loan deficiency payments) are taken para. 144, 148-149 of the First Submission of Brazil. Total production is taken from Exhibit Bra-4 ("Fact Sheet: Upland Cotton", USDA, January 2003, p. 4). 7 Step 2 payments per pound of actual production = total Step 2 expenditures/(total production [bales] * 480 [pounds/per bale]). Total Step 2 payments are contained in Exhibit Bra-4 ("Fact Sheet: Upland Cotton", USDA, January 2003, p. 6). Brazil has estimated the MY 2002 amount at note 335 in its First Submission to be $317 million. The amount of production has been taken from Exhibit Bra-4 ("Fact Sheet: Upland Cotton", USDA, January 2003, p. 4). Brazil notes that the difference between 3.95 cents per pound resulting from this calculation and 4 cents per pound ­ which was the basis for Brazil to calculate the total Step 2 payment for MY 2002 ­ is due to rounding effects. 8 Crop insurance payments per pound of actual production = total crop insurance expenditures / (total production [bales] * 480 [pounds/per bale]). Total crop insurance payments are taken from Exhibit Bra-57 ("Crop Year Statistics", Federal Crop Insurance Corporation). Total production is taken from Exhibit Bra-4 ("Fact Sheet: Upland Cotton," USDA, January 2003, p. 4). 9 Cottonseed payment per pound of actual upland cotton production = total cottonseed expenditures/(total production [bales] * 480 [pounds/per bale]). Total cottonseed payments are listed in Brazil's answer to question 17 (see para. 9). Total production is taken from Exhibit Bra-4 ("Fact Sheet: Upland Cotton", USDA, January 2003, p. 4).
98. Brazil notes that also under this approach, the total US support to upland cotton in MY 19992002 surpasses the support decided by the United States in MY 1992. Brazil furthermore notes that even considering the support programs (and their respective replacements)99 individually, nearly all of them provide higher support in MY 1999-2002 than they (or their predecessors) did in MY 1992 (with the exception of Step 2 and PFC / market loss assistance in MY 2001).
61. Does the United States consider that Article 13(b)(ii) permits a comparison on any basis other than a per pound basis? USA
62. According to Prof. Sumner's calculation, the per pound support increased by approximately 24 % from 1992 to 2002. On the other hand, the Panel understands that the
99 The deficiency payments were replaced by PFC and market loss assistance payments in MY 19992001 and by direct and counter-cyclical payments in MY 2002.

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-38
total budget outlay, according to Brazil, increased more than that. What, in Brazil's view, is the reason for this difference in the rate of increase? BRA
Brazil's Answer:
99. US budgetary outlays for upland cotton are a function of the level of price, income and other support provided by the US support programmes. Everything being equal, an increase in the "rate of support" as interpreted by the United States would translate one-to-one into an increase of expenditure. However, the "rate of support" is not the only determinant of budgetary outlays, as two important qualifications apply. First, the most important US subsidy programmes for upland cotton are price-based.100 For instance the marketing loan payment in MY 2002 guarantees a return of 52 cents per pound. With lower market prices, the gap between the adjusted world price and the loan rate, i.e., the basis for the calculation of the marketing loan benefit, widens and payments per pound increase. During the period MY 1992-2001, prices for upland cotton fell drastically.101 For example, average upland cotton prices received by farmers in the United States were 53.7 cents per pound in MY 1992 and dropped to a low of 29.8 cents per pound in MY 2001.102 Therefore, even for an identical set of programs providing an identical "rate of support," budgetary outlays would have vastly increased due to the drop in prices.
100. Second, the United States increased the production of upland cotton between MY 1992 and MY 1999-2002 from 15.7 million bales in MY 1992 to 16.3 million bales in MY 1999, 16.8 million bales in MY 2000, 19.6 million bales in MY 2001 and 16.7 million bales in MY 2002.103 Thus, the increased "rate of support" was applicable to an increased production of upland cotton.
101. In sum, budgetary outlays for upland cotton increased between MY 1992 and MY 2002 for three main reasons: first, the United States increased its "rate of support", second, lower upland cotton prices led to higher budgetary outlays per pound of upland cotton produced; and third, at times of falling market prices, the United States expanded its upland cotton production so that more upland cotton was eligible to receive the increased rate of support. All of this resulted in an increase of budgetary outlays for upland cotton that is relatively bigger than the increase in the US "rate of support".
102. Lastly, Brazil notes that none of the figures presented by Professor Sumner104 represent actual payments or actual rates of support. Rather, those figures represent average or expected rates of support in any given marketing year. They are not based on actual production or prices,105 but solely on expected production and prices. Therefore, they cannot easily be compared to actual payments made by the United States in support of upland cotton. Professor Sumner chose the expected support approach in order to match the approach suggested by the United States as closely as possible, while correcting for its simplistic reliance on the target price that disregarded the eligibility criteria and other features of the programmes.
63. In relation to Prof. Sumner's presentation at the first session of the first substantive meeting, please elaborate on the reasons behind the increase in the figures (from 1992 to 2002) concerning Loan Support and Step 2 payments. BRA
100 These include the marketing loan program, the deficiency payment program, the counter-cyclical payment programme and the Step 2 programs.
101 See First Submission of Brazil, para. 28. 102 Exhibit Bra-4 ("Fact Sheet: Upland Cotton," USDA, January 2003, p. 5). 103 Exhibit Bra-4 ("Fact Sheet: Upland Cotton," USDA, January 2003, p. 4). 104 See Exhibit Bra-105 (Statement of Professor Daniel Sumner at the First Meeting of the Panel). 105 Which would only be important for the rate of Step 2 payments, as only this programme depends on actual prices for purposes of a rate of support. The other programs reduce Government payments with increasing prices, so that the total rate of support remains basically the same, or are not price-related.

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-39
Brazil's Answer:
103. The support rate from the marketing loan programme calculated by Professor Sumner represents the expected support rate from the marketing loan programme. Concerning the marketing loan programme, Brazil notes that the statutory loan rate, indeed, fell from 52.35 cents per pound in MY 1992 to 51.92 cents per pound in MY 1999-2001106 before being slightly increased in MY 2002 to 52 cents per pound.107 However, the somewhat higher loan rate in MY 1992 was accompanied by strict eligibility criteria.108 In MY 1992, only production on farmland that participated in the upland cotton deficiency payment programme was eligible for marketing loan benefits, which restricted eligibility to 84.7 percent of production.109 In MY 1999-2001, only upland cotton produced on farmland that participated in the PFC programme was eligible. Professor Sumner has conservatively used 97 percent of upland cotton production in MY 1999-2001 as the participation rate of upland cotton.110 Finally, in MY 2002, all US production of upland cotton was eligible to receive marketing loan benefits.111 Thus, taking into account the eligibility criteria for benefiting from the marketing loan programme, the slightly higher loan rate in MY 1992 provided less support to total expected US upland cotton production than the slightly lower loan rates in later years.
104. Concerning the difference between the expected Step 2 rate of support in MY 1992-2001 and MY 2002, this difference stems from the fact that the United States eliminated the 1.25 cents per pound threshold for Step 2 payments in the 2002 FSRI Act. Before MY 2002, Step 2 payments were made in the amount of the difference between the A-Index and the lowest priced US quote for upland cotton minus a 1.25 cents per pound threshold. Section 1207(a)(4) of the 2002 FSRI Act postpones the application of this threshold until 1 August 2006.112 Thus, expected Step 2 payments for MY 2002 (and through MY 2005) will be 1.25 cents per pound higher than under the 1990 and 1996 Farm Acts, which both applied the threshold.113
64. Do the figures cited in Prof. Sumner's presentation at the first session of the first substantive meeting indicate amount available or amount spent? Can the Panel derive amount spent from these figures? If Article 13(b)(ii) requires a rate of support comparison, is the rate of support the "rate" of support available or the "rate" at which the support was spent? BRA
Brazil's Answer:
105. The figures in Professor Sumner's calculation do not indicate amounts spent, but were an attempt to approximate the expected rate of support for an expected pound of upland cotton production under the specific rules in place for each support programme in that year. The figures attempt to represent the normal result that would have been expected by policy makers and farmers as a result of the programme decisions taken by the United States. They do not represent actual expenditures per unit for any programme in any year because, in every year, the actual programme payments per pound of actual production deviates from the expected or normal payments, because the actual production will not exactly equal the expected production.
106 Exhibit Bra-4 ("Fact Sheet: Upland Cotton", USDA, January 2003, p. 5). 107 Exhibit Bra-29 (Section 1202(a)(6) and 1202(b)(6) of the 2002 FSRI Act). 108 See Exhibit US-3 (7 CFR 1427.4(a)(3) and 7 CFR 1413 (1992 edition)). 109 Annex 2 to Exhibit Bra-105 (Statement of Professor Daniel Sumner at the First Meeting of the Panel, p. 3). 110 Annex 2 to Exhibit Bra-105 (Statement of Professor Daniel Sumner at the First Meeting of the Panel, p. 4). 111 Exhibit Bra-29 (Section 1201(b) of the 2002 FSRI Act). 112 Exhibit Bra-29 (Section 1207(a)(4) of the 2002 FSRI Act). 113 See Exhibit Bra-12 ("Cotton: Background for 1995 Farm Legislation", USDA, April 1995, p. 16) and Exhibit Bra-46 ("Cotton: Background and Issues for Farm Legislation," USDA, July 2001, p. 9).

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-40
106. For some of the US support programs, the support indicated can be considered ­ within certain limits ­ as support available per pound. However, there is not a complete identity between the "expected rate of support" and the "support available to a pound of actual upland cotton production," because ­ as noted above ­ expected and actual production will vary from each other.
107. For marketing loan benefits, the loan rate can be considered the maximum support available to eligible production in case the market price would fall to zero. Similarly, for deficiency and counter-cyclical payments, the difference between the loan rate and the target price can be considered the maximum support available, albeit again only for the eligible production. The expected support differs from that, as it takes into account that not all of the expected production will benefit from those subsidies. The actual support differs again, as expected and actual production may not be identical. Finally, actual US Government payments depend on market prices.
108. For PFC, market loss assistance, direct and cottonseed payments and crop insurance subsidies, the "expected rates of support" represent expected expenditures per unit of expected production. This has been calculated by using average budget expenditures over an appropriate period as expected support, and by using average production as the expected production. Thus, these payments are not maximum available "rates of support". For example, under the crop insurance programme the US Government pays premium subsidies. Higher per unit support would have been available had all farms joined the programme at the maximum subsidized rates. However, this was not an expected or normal occurrence. Especially in MY 1992, when subsidy rates were relatively low, many upland cotton farms were expected to forgo participation in the programme. Both maximum available crop insurance subsidies as well as expected or normal crop insurance subsidies increased for MY 1999 through 2002, as premium subsidies rose and more cotton acreage found the programme attractive. For crop insurance, but also for PFC and direct payments as well as market loss assistance, the actual support per pound of upland cotton production will vary with the actual production undertaken and actual yields achieved.
109. The actual "rate of support" from the Step 2 payments depends on the actual price differential between the A-Index and the lowest-prices US quote. While it varies from the expected "rate of support" with the actual realization of the price gap, it is not expected to be systematically correlated to the actual level of prices.
110. In sum, it is not possible to derive the amount spent from the "expected rate of support" calculated by Professor Sumner without adding additional information on the level of market prices and the actual US upland cotton acreage, yield and production, among other variables. Following the US approach, Professor Sumner has calculated an expected rate of support that could be characterized as an expected guaranteed revenue. This approach is distinct from an approach looking into actual expenditures, as favoured and advocated by Brazil. In fact, Professor Sumner applied the US approach to a rate of support that would abstract in as far as possible from actual expenditures.
111. Brazil refers the Panel to its answers to questions 60 and 67 for actual expenditures by year, by programme ­ both per pounds of upland cotton production and as total expenditures for upland cotton.
112. Should the Panel decide that the required test under Article 13(b)(ii) is a "rate of support", Brazil submits that the relevant rate of support is "expenditures per pound of production", and thus the "'rate' at which support was spent", as discussed in Brazil's answer to Question 60.
65. Does Brazil consider that adjustment for inflation is relevant in the context of the comparison under Article 13 (b)(ii) ? BRA

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-41

Brazil's Answer:

113. Brazil does not believe that an adjustment for inflation is relevant in the context of the comparison under Article 13(b)(ii). First, there is nothing in the text of Article 13(b)(ii) that provides for such an adjustment. Second, the only provision of the Agreement on Agriculture addressing inflation is Article 18.4, which provides: "In the review process Members should give due consideration to the influence of excessive rates of inflation on the ability of any Member to abide by its domestic support commitments." The "review process" is the review by the Committee on Agriculture of the progress of implementation of commitments as set out in Article 18 of the Agreement on Agriculture. The fact that negotiators explicitly opened the possibility of "giving due consideration to the influence of excessive rates of inflation" in the review process, but not for purposes of Article 13(b)(ii), is evidence that this omission was intentional.

114. Furthermore, at no time during the review process has the United States ever stated or made any notifications that "excessive rates of inflation" in the US economy have negatively impacted "the ability of [the United States] to abide by its domestic support commitments". Even, if it had, Article 18.4 has no relevance for the purposes of the comparison required by Article 13(b)(ii), as it refers to the review process only, and not to the peace clause. Accordingly, there is no basis for the Panel to apply any adjustment to the US level of support to upland cotton in marketing year 1992.

115. Nevertheless, if the Panel should decide to use such an adjustment, Brazil submits that the appropriate index to be used is the applicable US agricultural price index. Three alternative indexes could be used. The first and most direct is the index of prices received for cotton. Other indexes that may be considered are the index of prices received for crops and the index of prices received for all farm products.

2000 2001 2002

Index of prices received for cotton Index of prices received for all crops Index of prices received for all farm products
1990 to 1992 average = 100114

82 65 49 96 99 103 96 102 99

116. Thus, under none of the applicable indices is there any significant inflation to be taken into account. To the contrary, the cotton price index fell by 51 percent, while price indices for crops and all farm products have been stable if compared to the 1990-1992 base used by USDA.

66. Could you please comment on the relative merits of each of the following calculation methods for the purposes of the comparison of support to upland cotton with 1992, irrespective of whether a particular measure should be included or excluded:

(a) Total budgetary outlays (Brazil's approach). USA

(b) Budgetary outlays per unit of upland cotton: Could you please calculate and provide an estimate for the marketing years 1992 and 1999-2002, respectively, and draw attention to any factors/qualifications that the Panel would need to be aware of. BRA, USA

114 Exhibit Bra-149 (Agricultural Outlook, August 2002, p. 38)

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-42
Brazil's Answer:
117. Brazil has presented figures for budgetary outlays by unit of actual production in its answer to Question 60. However, Brazil would like to add some further considerations on the shortcomings of this approach.
118. A significant issue in using these per unit figures to represent support rather than total budgetary outlays is that a per-unit approach discounts the fact that some of the change in production is itself caused by changes in the rate of support or subsidy. If support is calculated by dividing budgetary outlays by total production, the result neglects this effect. As support rises in the numerator, production rises in the denominator and the ratio or per unit of an increased support rate rises by less than total support (and may even decline).
119. The perverse effect is that the more production is stimulated by the US domestic support programmes and, thus, the more those programmes distort trade, the smaller the per unit measure effect of the increased subsidy. For this reason, a subsidy rate per unit of actual production should be avoided or used with extreme caution.
(c) Per unit rate of support (United States approach): How should changes in acreage, eligibility and payment limitations per farm(s) (commodity certificate programmes) be factored into this approach? BRA
Brazil's Answer:
120. The approach of the United States was simply to assert that the target price represented the rate of support per unit in MY 1992 and the loan rate alone represented the rate of support per unit in MY 2002. This approach rests on several fundamental errors.
121. First, the approach left out major support programs in each year. For 1992, the approach left out the Step 2 programme and crop insurance, both of which provided support to upland cotton in that year. For 2002, the approach of the United States left out support provided by the direct payment programme, the counter-cyclical payment programme and the cottonseed payment programme as well as the Step 2 and crop insurance programmes.
122. Second, the United States did not account for any factors that limited eligibility for support or imposed costs of participation as a mandatory condition of receiving support from the US support programmes. The failure to account for these factors in each year completely ignores the true nature of the US support programmes for upland cotton and seriously distorts the rate of support.
123. Lastly, these two per pound numbers cannot simply be added together because the eligibility criteria differ between them and, in particular, the support from the upland cotton deficiency payment programme was expected to apply to an even smaller share of actual production than the support from the marketing loan programme.
124. Professor Sumner's calculation attempted to correct the US presentation for these serious flaws in the implementation of the US approach. Professor Sumner added back the programmes that provide support to upland cotton, but that have been left out by the United States. He also corrected the rate of support for eligibility restrictions and the cost of participation, and presented the rate of support on the basis of expected production in order to be able to sum up the various "rates of support." At the same time, Professor Sumner has attempted to remain true to the approach of the United States by avoiding the use of actual production or actual payments, and instead relying on expected programme support per unit and expected or normal production to arrive at per unit support. Professor Sumner's approach also deals in detail with the question of how to account for eligibility

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-43
restrictions and costs of participation. Brazil refers the Panel to Annex 2 to Exhibit Bra-105 for the details of Professor Sumner's methodology.
125. In addition to eligibility, the Panel's question refers specifically to payment limits. Payment limits are applied on the basis of persons, including corporations, partnerships, producers and other persons actively engaged in agriculture.115 Typically, for larger farms, there is more than one person actively engaged in agriculture, including spouses, and landlords on a share rental basis. In addition, there is typically more than one legal entity per farm and under the three entity rule, a person may receive programme payments from three entities and up to double the payment limit for that person for one entity.116
126. Payment limits for deficiency payments in MY 1992 were $50,000.117 Payment limits for PFC (in MY 1999-2001)118 were $40,000,119 as is the case for direct payments (in MY 2002).120 Payment limits for counter-cyclical payments are $65,000 (in MY 2002).121 For the marketing loan programme, a payment limitation of $75,000 per person applied in MY 1992. In the 1996 FAIR Act, the payment limits for the marketing loan programme was also $75,000, but was increased to $150,000 for MY 1999-2001 by supplemental legislation.122 The 2002 FSRI Act limits the amount of marketing loan gains and loan deficiency payments to a total of $75,000 for each producer.123 However, the key change between MY 1992 and MY 1999-2002 was the establishment of the certificate programme in MY 1999,124 which effectively eliminated any payment limit for the marketing loan programme.125
127. Brazil has no data that would allow it to factor payment limitations into the calculation of an expected rate of support. However, Brazil notes that with the inception of the commodity certificate programme in MY 1999, the limitations imposed by payment limits have ­ if anything ­ been relaxed. Additionally, Brazil notes that its approach to Article 13(b)(ii), by comparing total budgetary outlays, takes the budgetary effects of payment limitations into account. For farmers that have reached their payment limit, the US Government incurs no further expenditures, and consequently, the amount of expenditures is lower than it would be absent the payment limit. In that sense, actual expenditures reflect the effects of payment limits.
128. Finally, Brazil notes that Professor Sumner's calculations also do not account for the increase in production or acreage devoted to upland cotton between MY 1992 and MY 2002. Taking this into account by indexing the "expected rate of support" to the level of MY 1992 production ­ as one
115 Exhibit Bra-33 (7 CFR 1400.1 et seq.). 116 Exhibit Bra-33 (7 CFR 1400.1 et seq.). 117 Exhibit Bra-12 ("Cotton: Background for 1995 Farm Legislation," USDA, April 1995, p. 14). 118 Additional market loss assistance payments were made that did not count towards the PFC payment limit. 119 Professor Sumner has stated in his statement at the first meeting of the Panel that a typical cotton farm with 3000 acres received about $300,000 in PFC payments per year (see Exhibit Bra-105 (Statement of Professor Daniel Sumner at the First Meeting of the Panel, p. 22). This amount results both from the fact that several persons on a farm may be eligible for payment and from the fact that the three-entity rule doubled the payment limit amount a single person could legally receive (for an explanation on the three-entity rule see paragraphs 74-76 of the First Submission of Brazil). 120 Exhibit Bra-27 (Side by Side Comparison of the 1996 and 2002 Farm Act, USDA, p. 12). 121 Exhibit Bra-27 (Side by Side Comparison of the 1996 and 2002 Farm Act, USDA, p. 12). 122 Exhibit Bra-27 (Side by Side Comparison of the 1996 and 2002 Farm Act, USDA, p. 12). 123 Exhibit Bra-42 (The 2002 Farm Act, Provisions and Implications for Commodity Markets," USDA, November 2002, p. 7). 124 Exhibit Bra-42 (The 2002 Farm Act, Provisions and Implications for Commodity Markets," USDA, November 2002, p. 8); Exhibit Bra-29 (Section 1603 of the 2002 FSRI Act). 125 The certificate programme is described in detail in paragraphs 75-76 of the First Submission of Brazil.

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-44
possible approach to account for the increase in production ­ would increase the "expected rate of support" for later marketing years, as the amount of US production of upland cotton increased.126 The result of the comparison of MY 1992 and MY 1999-2002 support will, however, be the same: The United States' support to upland cotton in MY 1999-2002 exceeded the support to upland cotton decided in MY 1992 and the US domestic support measures fail to meet the condition in Article 13(b)(ii) for exemption from actions under Articles 5 and 6 of the SCM Agreement and GATT Article XVI:1.
(d) Per unit rate of support for upland cotton (Prof. Sumner's approach at the first session of the first substantive meeting ). USA
(67) The Panel requests the parties to calculate and submit estimates of the AMS for upland cotton for marketing years 1992, 1999, 2000, 2001 and 2002. For this purpose the parties are each requested to submit AMS calculations for upland cotton (using the budgetary-outlay/nonprice gap methodology employed by the United States in respect of cotton in its DS Notifications (e.g., G/AG/N/USA/43) and using the formats and supporting tables in document G/AG/2) on the same basis as would be the case in calculating a product specific AMS for the purposes of the calculation of the "Total Current AMS" in any year in accordance with the relevant provisions, including as appropriate Article 1(a), (b) and (h), Article 6 and Annex 3 to the Agreement. BRA, USA
Brazil's Answer:
129. Brazil sets forth the following table that summarizes the AMS calculation for upland cotton for marketing years 1992 and 1999-2002. Using the definition of non-product specific support detailed in Brazil's answer to the Panel's Question 40, all of the programmes listed constitute nonexempt direct payments, within the meaning of G/AG/2, providing product-specific support to upland cotton. The table includes all support programs that should have been included in "Supporting Table DS:6", within the meaning of G/AG/2. To the best of Brazil's knowledge, no other "productspecific" support to upland cotton has been provided by the US Government.
130. Brazil notes that the United States has notified the deficiency payments using the price gap methodology provided for in Annex 3.127 Brazil considers it appropriate to follow the US decision and will, therefore, calculate the amount of support to upland cotton provided by the deficiency payment programme by using the "price gap" approach detailed in Annex 3, paragraph 10 and 11. Brazil notes that US budgetary expenditures for MY 1992 for the deficiency programme were $1,017.4 million.128

_______________________
1 This calculation is based on the price gap formula set forth in para. 10 and 11 of AoA Annex 3. In its notification of
marketing year 1995 support (Exhibit Bra-150 (G/AG/N/USA/10, p. 18), the United States that the applied administered

price for upland cotton under the deficiency payment programme is $1,607.169 per ton. The applied administered price (or

target price) has been the same in MY 1992 and MY 1995 (Exhibit Bra-4 ("Fact Sheet: Upland Cotton", USDA,

January 2003, p. 5). Therefore, Brazil uses that figure. The external reference price has been notified by the United States to

be $1,275.741 per ton. Paragraph 11 of AoA Annex 3 specifies that the external reference price is based on 1986-1988

averages that have not changed between MY 1992 and MY 1995. Thus, Brazil bases the price-related direct payments from

the deficiency payment programme in MY 1992 on the difference between $1,607.169 per ton and $1,275.741 per ton

($331.428 per ton) multiplied by the eligible production, which results from multiplying the eligible upland cotton base

acreage and the payment yield. Professor Sumner has calculated the eligible upland cotton base acreage for MY 1992 to be

10.17 million acres, while the payment yield is 531 pounds per acres (Exhibit Bra-105 (Annex 2 to Statement of Professor

Daniel Sumner at the First Meeting of the Panel, p. 5-6). Thus, the eligible production is 5,400,270,000 pounds or 2,450,213

metric tons (2204 pounds equal one metric ton). Thus, the amount of deficiency payments in that enters the calculation of

total AMS for MY 1992 is 2,450,213 metric tons * $331.428 per ton = $812.069 million. 2 PFC payment expenditure for upland cotton = total PFC payment expenditure for upland cotton base * (actual upland

cotton acreage / PFC upland cotton base acreage). Total PFC payment expenditure for upland cotton is taken from Exhibit

Bra-4 ("Fact Sheet: Upland Cotton," USDA, January 2003, p. 6). This amount has been adjusted by the ratio of upland

cotton acres actually planted (Exhibit Bra-4 ("Fact Sheet: Upland Cotton," USDA, January 2003, p. 4)) to upland cotton base

acres in the PFC programme (Exhibit Bra-142 (Agricultural Outlook, May 2002, p. 50)). This adjustment is necessary

because only the portion of upland cotton PFC payments that actually benefits acres planted to upland cotton can be

considered support to upland cotton. 3 Market loss assistance expenditure for upland cotton = total market loss assistance expenditure for upland cotton base *

(actual upland cotton acreage / market loss assistance (i.e., PFC) upland cotton base acreage). Total market loss assistance

expenditures for upland cotton is taken from Exhibit Bra-4 ("Fact Sheet: Upland Cotton," USDA, January 2003, p. 6). This

amount has been adjusted by the ratio of upland cotton acres actually planted (Exhibit Bra-4 ("Fact Sheet: Upland Cotton,"

USDA, January 2003, p. 4)) to upland cotton base acres in the market loss assistance (i.e., PFC) programme (Exhibit Bra-

142 (Agricultural Outlook, May 2002, p. 50)). This adjustment is necessary because only the portion of upland cotton

market loss assistance payments that actually benefits acres planted to upland cotton can be considered support to upland

cotton. 4 Direct payments = total direct payment expenditure for upland cotton base * (actual upland cotton acreage / direct payment

upland cotton base acreage). Total direct payments for MY 2002 have been re-estimated from the figure presented by Brazil

in its First Submission, para. 59. The new figure is based on the statutory payment rate of 6.67 cents per pound of upland

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-46
cotton base multiplied by the direct payment upland cotton base acreage of 16.3 million acres (Brazil has assumed it to be the previous 5-year average as reported by USDA in Exhibit Bra-142 (Agricultural Outlook, May 2002, p. 50)) multiplied by the direct payment yield of 604 pounds per acre (Brazil has assumed it to be the previous 5-year average as reported by USDA in Exhibit Bra-142 (Agricultural Outlook, May 2002, p. 50)). Payments are made on 85 percent of base acres. This translates into a total of $558.17 million. This amount has been adjusted by the ratio of upland cotton acres actually planted Exhibit Bra-4 ("Fact Sheet: Upland Cotton," USDA, January 2003, p. 4) to upland cotton base acres in the direct payment program. This adjustment is necessary because only the portion of upland cotton market loss assistance payments that actually benefits acres planted to upland cotton can be considered support to upland cotton. 5 Counter-cyclical payments = total counter-cyclical payment expenditure for upland cotton base * (actual upland cotton acreage / counter-cyclical payment upland cotton base acreage). Total counter-cyclical payments for MY 2002 have been reestimated from the figure presented by Brazil in its First Submission, para. 69. The new figure is based on the MY 2002 payment rate of 13.73 cents per pound of upland cotton base multiplied by the counter-cyclical payment upland cotton base acreage of 16.3 million acres (Brazil has assumed it to be the previous 5-year average as reported by USDA in Exhibit Bra142 (Agricultural Outlook, May 2002, p. 50)) multiplied by the counter-cyclical payment yield of 604 pounds per acre (Brazil has assumed it to be the previous 5-year average as reported by USDA in Exhibit Bra-142 (Agricultural Outlook, May 2002, p. 50) Brazil notes that this underestimates the payments, as it disregards the yield update for purposes of the counter-cyclical payments). Payments are made on 85 percent of base acres. This translates into a total of $1148.98 million. This amount has been adjusted by the ratio of upland cotton acres actually planted Exhibit Bra-4 ("Fact Sheet: Upland Cotton," USDA, January 2003, p. 4) to upland cotton base acres in the counter-cyclical payment program. This adjustment is necessary because only the portion of upland cotton market loss assistance payments that actually benefits acres planted to upland cotton can be considered support to upland cotton. 6 Total marketing loan payments (marketing loan gains plus loan deficiency payments) are taken para. 144, 148-149 of the First Submission of Brazil. 7 Total Step 2 payments are contained in Exhibit Bra-4 ("Fact Sheet: Upland Cotton," USDA, January 2003, p. 6). Brazil has estimated the MY 2002 amount at note 335 in its First Submission to be $317 million. 8 Total crop insurance payments are taken from Exhibit Bra-57 ("Crop Year Statistics," Federal Crop Insurance Corporation). 9 Total cottonseed payments are listed in Brazil's answer to question 17 (see para. 9).
131. The figures presented above indicate that, using the AMS approach, the US level of support for MY 1992 is lower than in each of the marketing years between 1999 and 2002.
132. Brazil also notes that ­ as explained in the notes on the sources and methodology for arriving at the reported figures ­ the AMS figures for MY 1999-2002 reflect revised amounts of budgetary expenditures that should replace those listed in Brazil's First Submission at paragraphs 148-149.129 These revised (and somewhat smaller) expenditures reflect new information collected by Brazil and more accurately tabulate support to upland cotton in MY 1999-2002. Brazil notes that none of these revisions results in any significant change to the total support to upland cotton, and that expenditures decided in MY 1992 are still well below expenditures related to MY 1999-2002.
68. Could you please clarify the result of the calculations of, and the meaning of the title, in Appendix Table 1 "Estimated per unit Subsidy Rates by Programme and Year" in Annex 2 to Exhibit BRA-105, page 12. Why are the numbers calculated for marketing loans considered to be subsidies? Could the Panel, for example, read the "total level of support" (bottom line of the table) as the effective support price for upland cotton or the maximum rate of support for upland cotton? BRA, USA
Brazil's Answer:
133. The Appendix Table 1 in Annex 2 to Exhibit Bra-105 should have been titled, "Estimated per unit Support Rates by Programme and Year". Brazil apologizes for any confusion caused by mistitling this table.
134. The marketing loan programme support listed in Table 1 of Annex 2 to Exhibit Bra-105 is a "support rate" and not an actual loan deficiency payment or marketing loan gain. It does not represent a subsidy amount. The loan deficiency payment or marketing loan gain is calculated as the difference between the loan rate and the adjusted world price (AWP). When the AWP falls, the loan benefit per
129 No such revision is necessary for MY 1992.

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-47
unit of eligible production rises to offset the fall in the AWP. In the US "rate of support" methodology, because the AWP is expected to be positively related to the price received by individual farmers in the United States, the loan rate of 52.35 cents per pound in MY 1992 can be considered an approximate rate of support per unit of eligible production.
135. The deficiency payment rate of support is similar to the marketing loan rate of support and represents the maximum rate of support per eligible unit, where eligibility is measured by the rules applicable in 1992. By contrast, actual support payments under Brazil's expenditure methodology are calculated as the difference between the higher of the average price received by farmers and the loan rate.
136. The other programmes listed in Table 1 provide support per unit of eligible production to upland cotton in addition to the loan rate and deficiency payment target price. These other programmes are calculated as the estimated expected support rates. These rates are not maximum rates of support but rather normal or expected rates of support. The other domestic support measures are not equivalent in overall effect to a price support, but they are calculated on a per unit basis and are added across programmes to give a total support rate.
137. The production and trade distorting effects of these subsidies are each different and are also different from a support price.130 Brazil will discuss the adverse effects caused by each of those subsidies in its Further Submission, scheduled for 9 September 2003. The variety of the support programmes employed by the United States precludes interpreting the sum of the various support contributions as a "support price." However, their sum can be read as an expected guaranteed income that results from market revenue and US Government payments. Marketing loan benefits, deficiency payments and counter-cyclical payments will increase with falling market prices. Other support programs are relatively decoupled from market prices, and provide an expected rate of support, that can be added to the loan rate and target price established by the marketing loan, the deficiency and counter-cyclical payments.
69. Can the United States confirm that the "marketing year" for upland cotton is 1 August to 31 July ? Can the United States confirm the Panel's understanding that USDA data for the "crop year" corresponds to the "marketing year"? USA
E. EXPORT CREDIT GUARANTEE PROGRAMMES
70. How does Brazil respond to the United States' assertion that Brazil is trying to realize through litigation what it could not achieve in past negotiations? BRA
Brazil's Answer:
138. In WTO dispute settlement, there is only one way to determine what was achieved in past negotiations ­ to interpret those provisions actually concluded according to the customary rules of interpretation included in the Vienna Convention. In paragraphs 100-115 of Brazil's Statement at the First Panel Meeting, Brazil demonstrated that it is not in fact attempting "to realize through litigation what it could not achieve in past negotiations." In those paragraphs, Brazil demonstrated that under the ordinary meaning of Article 10.2 of the Agreement on Agriculture, in its context and according to the object and purpose of Article 10 and the Agreement on Agriculture overall, export credit guarantees are subject to the general export subsidy disciplines in the Agreement on Agriculture. Brazil will not repeat those arguments here, but simply notes that by ignoring an interpretation of Article 10.2 according to the Vienna Convention rules, it is the United States that is trying to escape what was in fact achieved in the Uruguay Round negotiations. Other participants in those
130 See Exhibit Bra-105 (Statement by Professor Daniel Sumner at the First Meeting of the Panel, paras 20-39) for a summary of the economic impacts of these various support programs.

negotiations who are third parties in this dispute and who in fact use export credits ­ Canada, the European Communities and New Zealand ­ agree with Brazil.
71. (a) Is an export credit guarantee a financial contribution in the form of a "potential direct transfer of funds or liabilities (e.g. loan guarantee)" within the meaning of Article 1.1(a)(1)(i) of the SCM Agreement? Why or why not? Does it confer a benefit within the meaning of Article 1.1(b)? Why or why not? If so, to whom? USA
Brazil's Comment:
139. In paragraphs 287-289 of its First Submission, and again at paragraph 116 of its Statement at the First Panel Meeting, Brazil demonstrated that CCC export credit guarantees are expressly included as "financial contributions" within the meaning of Article 1.1(a)(1)(i) of the SCM Agreement. Although export credit guarantees do not automatically confer benefits, CCC export credit guarantees confer "benefits" within the meaning of Article 1.1(b) because they are extended at premium rates and on repayment terms that are not available and in fact do not exist on the market. In its comments and answers to Questions 75 and 82 below, Brazil discusses passages from the GSM 102, GSM 103 and SCGP regulations and materials from USDA's Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS) concerning the programmes, which demonstrate that GSM 102, GSM 103 and SCGP confer "benefits".
140. Brazil notes that a number of agents benefit from the subsidy provided by the guarantees. The US financial institutions and the foreign bank enter into lucrative contracts they would not otherwise have, the importer also gets financing that would not otherwise have be available in the market, but the US Government ultimately designed the programs to provide a benefit to US farmers and exporters. On the FAS website "What Every Exporter Should Know About The GSM-102 and GSM-103 Programmes" it stated that the "USDA will consider announcing, for a specific country or region, the availability of guarantees for any US commercial commodity, if the market for US exports will be expanded or maintained as a result" (emphasis added).131 Brazil also notes that it is the US exporter who applies for the guarantee and who triggers the process of obtaining coverage for each particular transaction.
(b) How, if at all, would these elements be relevant to the claims of Brazil, and the United States response thereto? BRA, USA
Brazil's Answer:
141. Brazil notes that because CCC export credit guarantees constitute subsidies per se, and because they are, further, de jure contingent on export, the GSM 102, GSM 103 and SCGP programmes constitute export subsidies within the meaning of Article 3.1(a) of the SCM Agreement. According to the reasoning of the Appellate Body in US ­ FSC,132 this means that those programs are also export subsidies within the meaning of the Agreement on Agriculture. In paragraphs 295-304 of its First Submission, Brazil then demonstrated that those programs threaten to lead to circumvention of the United States' export subsidy commitments (both with respect to scheduled and unscheduled commodities), in violation of Article 10.1 of the Agreement on Agriculture and, as a consequence, of Article 8 of that Agreement. Having established a violation of Part V of the Agriculture Agreement, Brazil's claims under Article 3.1(a) of the SCM Agreement against the CCC export credit guarantee programmes are not exempt from action by Article 13(c)(ii) of the Agreement on Agriculture.

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-49
142. Articles 1.1(a)(1)(i) and 1.1(b) of the SCM Agreement are relevant for a number of reasons, including for the purposes of Article 10.3 of the Agreement on Agriculture. As demonstrated in paragraphs 263-268 of Brazil's First Submission, the United States has surpassed its export quantity commitment levels for commodities eligible for GSM 102, GSM 103 and SCGP support. Under Article 10.3, the burden now lies with the United States to prove that its exports in excess of these commitments did not benefit from export subsidies, including export credit guarantees. United States will, inter alia, have to prove that those programs do not grant "benefits" within the meaning of Article 1.1(b) of the SCM Agreement.133
72. Could Brazil expand on why, as indicated in paragraph 118 of its oral statement, it does "not agree" with the United States arguments relating to the viability of an a contrario interpretation of item (j) of the Illustrative List of Export Subsidies in Annex 1 of the SCM Agreement? BRA
Brazil's Answer:
143. As the Panel is aware, Brazil was earlier involved in a dispute (Brazil ­ Aircraft) that addressed the question whether certain items in the Illustrative List of Export Subsidies admit of an a contrario defense. Although, as the United States notes, Brazil argued in that dispute that a contrario interpretations of certain items included in the Illustrative List (in particular the first paragraph of item (k)) are enabled by footnote 5 to the SCM Agreement, the panel disagreed.
144. Footnote 5 provides that "Measures referred to in Annex I as not constituting export subsidies shall not be prohibited under this or any other provision of this Agreement." The first Article 21.5 panel in Brazil ­ Aircraft concluded as follows with respect to footnote 5:134
6.36 In its ordinary meaning, footnote 5 relates to situations where a measure is referred to as not constituting an export subsidy. Thus, one example of a measure that clearly falls within the scope of footnote 5 involves export credit practices that are in conformity with the interest rate provisions of the Arrangement on Guidelines for Officially Supported Export Credits ("Arrangement"). The second paragraph of item (k) provides that such measures "shall not be considered an export subsidy prohibited by this Agreement". Arguably, footnote 5 in its ordinary meaning could extend more broadly to cover cases where the Illustrative List contains some other form of affirmative statement that a measure is not subject to the Article 3.1(a) prohibition, that it is not prohibited, or that it is allowed, such as, for example, the first and last sentences of footnote 5934 and the proviso clauses of items (h)35 and (i)36 of the Illustrative List.37
6.37 The first paragraph of item (k), however, does not contain any affirmative statement that a measure is not an export subsidy nor that measures not satisfying the conditions of that item are not prohibited. To the contrary, the first paragraph of item (k) on its face simply identifies measures that are prohibited export subsidies. Thus, the first paragraph of item (k) on its face does not in our view fall within the scope of footnote 5 read in conformity with its ordinary meaning.
______________
34 The first sentence of footnote 59 provides that "Members recognize that deferral need not amount to an export subsidy where, for example, appropriate interest charges are collected." The last sentence states that "[p]aragraph (e) is not intended to limit a Member from taking measures to avoid the double taxation of foreign-source income earned by its enterprises or the enterprises of another Member."
133 The United States will also have to prove that the programmes are not inconsistent with item (j) of the Illustrative List of export subsidies.
134 Panel Report, Brazil ­ Aircraft (21.5), WT/DS46/RW, paras. 6.36-6.37.

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-50
35 ". . . provided, however, that prior-stage cumulative indirect taxes may be exempted, remitted or deferred on exported products even when not exempted, remitted or deferred on like products sold for domestic consumption, if the prior stage cumulative indirect taxes are levied on inputs that are consumed in the production of the exported product . . . ." (emphasis added). 36 ". . . provided, however, that in particular cases a firm may use a quantity of home market inputs equal to, and having the same quality and characteristics as, the imported inputs as a substitute for them . . . ." 37 In any event, such measures may well fall within the scope of footnote 1, and thus not represent subsidies at all, whether prohibited or otherwise.
145. Reflecting on footnote 5, the panel recalled and rejected the US argument that "`[t]he Illustrative List does not deal with all possible financial contributions, but for those it does deal with, it establishes, by virtue of footnote 5, a dispositive legal standard insofar as prohibited subsidies are concerned'".135 While the panel agreed that "an illustrative list could in principle operate in such a manner", it concluded that because of footnote 5, the Illustrative List of Export Subsidies annexed to the SCM Agreement did not operate in that manner.136 According to the panel, "if the drafters had intended the meaning which the United States attributes to footnote 5, they could certainly have found appropriate language to do so".137
146. The panel noted that the first paragraph of item (k) has effect even if it does not admit of an a contrario interpretation. The panel likened the Illustrative List to "a list of per se violations".138 According to the panel, even if a measure does not fulfill the elements of one of the items in the Illustrative List and therefore does not constitute a per se violation, it could still be deemed prohibited if the complaining party demonstrates that it fulfills the elements of Articles 1 and 3 of the SCM Agreement.139
147. In dicta, the Appellate Body suggested that the first paragraph of item (k) may indeed admit of an a contrario interpretation.140 In Brazil's view, however, this suggestion is limited to the first paragraph of item (k), and at least does not extend to item (j). Although the Appellate Body emphasized in the initial appeal in Brazil ­ Aircraft that the term "material advantage" in item (k) had to be given meaning independent of the term "benefit" in Article 1.1(b)141, it found that the difference between the two terms is the qualification in item (k) that the advantage conferred relative to the market must additionally be "material".142 In other words, proving "material advantage" includes a showing that a "benefit" is conferred, but also requires something more. While disproving the existence of a "material advantage" may mean that, in some narrow circumstances, a benefit may nevertheless still exist, the first paragraph of item (k) at least still relies on an analysis whether a "material advantage" is conferred to the recipient, as compared to some market benchmark. This "to the recipient" standard does not undercut and in fact complements the market benchmark "to the recipient" standard included in Article 1.1(b). An a contrario reading of item (k), therefore, does not read out the market benchmark "to the recipient" standard from the test applicable to export credits, but simply gives it a particular meaning in the context of export credits.

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-51
148. In contrast, the evidence required to meet the elements of item (j) are completely unrelated to the evidence necessary to establish that a guarantee programme confers a benefit "to the recipient" of a loan guarantee. Whether the premia collected under an export credit guarantee programme meet the long-term operating costs and losses of the programme is completely irrelevant to the question whether a benefit "to the recipient" of the export credit guarantee is conferred. Consequently, allowing an a contrario reading of item (j) that provides, as the United States argues, "a dispositive legal standard"143 for determining whether guarantees are prohibited, would suggest that the "to the recipient" market benchmark standard does not apply to guarantees. This cannot be true, since guarantees are expressly included in Article 1.1 (and Article 14(c)) as "financial contributions" that can confer "benefits" to a recipient relative to a market benchmark.
149. The conclusion that item (j) does not admit of an a contrario defense is relevant for a number of reasons, including for the purposes of Article 10.3 of the Agreement on Agriculture. As demonstrated in paragraphs 263-268 of Brazil's First Submission, the United States has surpassed its export quantity commitment levels for commodities eligible for GSM 102, GSM 103 and SCGP support. Under Article 10.3, the burden now lies with the United States to prove that its exports in excess of these commitments did not benefit from export subsidies, including export credit guarantees. Even if the United States is able to demonstrate that premia for the GSM 102, GSM 103 and SCGP programs meet long-term operating costs and losses, it will also have to prove that those programs do not grant "benefits" within the meaning of Article 1.1(b) of the SCM Agreement. Since item (j) does not admit of an a contrario interpretation, disproving the elements of item (j) will not be sufficient to remove the programs from the definition of "export subsidy."
73. The Panel could arguably take the view that Articles 1 and 3 of the SCM Agreement were relevant in assessing the WTO-consistency of United States export credit guarantees. The United States has yet to submit any evidence or argumentation on this point, either as potential context for interpretation of the terms in Article 10 of the Agreement on Agriculture or in relation to Brazil's claims under the SCM Agreement. The Panel would therefore appreciate United States views in respect of this situation, and invites the United States to submit relevant argumentation and evidence. USA
74. If the Panel decides to refer to provisions of the SCM Agreement for contextual guidance in the interpretation of the terms in Article 10 of the Agreement on Agriculture, should the Panel refer to item (j) or Articles 1 and 3 of the SCM Agreement or both? BRA, USA
Brazil's Answer:
150. In determining what constitutes an export subsidy within the meaning of Article 10.1 of the Agreement on Agriculture, Brazil considers that the Panel should refer to contextual guidance included in Articles 1 and 3 of the SCM Agreement, and in item (j) of the Illustrative List of Export Subsidies annexed to the SCM Agreement. As discussed in paragraphs 258-261 of Brazil's First Submission, this is consistent with the Appellate Body's decisions in US ­ FSC144 and Canada ­ Dairy.145 As a factual matter, Brazil has demonstrated that the GSM 102, GSM 103 and SCGP programmes constitute export subsidies under Articles 1.1 and 3.1(a) of the SCM Agreement, and under item (j) of the Illustrative List (as well as under Articles 1(e) and 10.1 of the Agreement on Agriculture.
75. The Panel's attention has been drawn to Article 14(c) of the SCM Agreement (see e.g. written third party submission of Canada) and to the panel report in DS 222 Canada- Export Credits and Loan Guarantees. How and to what extent are Article 14(c) of the SCM

Agreement, and the cited panel report, relevant to the issue of whether or not the United States export credit guarantee programmes confer a "benefit"? What would be the appropriate market benchmark to use for any comparison? Please cite any other relevant material. BRA, USA
Brazil's Answer:
151. As one way of demonstrating that the GSM 102, GSM 103 and SCGP programs constitute export subsidies within the meaning of Article 10.1 of the Agreement on Agriculture, Brazil has demonstrated that those programmes constitute financial contributions that confer benefits and that are contingent on export, within the meaning of Articles 1.1 and 3.1(a) of the SCM Agreement. Brazil recalls that as discussed above in response to Question 72, Article 10.3 of the Agreement on Agriculture in fact places the burden on the United States to prove that export quantities in excess of its export commitments have not benefited from export subsidies.
152. In any event, Brazil has demonstrated that the CCC guarantee programs confer "benefits" within the meaning of Article 1.1(b) because they are extended at premium rates and on repayment terms that are not available on the market. In fact, the CCC programmes are unique financing vehicles for agricultural commodity transactions that are not available on the commercial market.
153. Brazil notes that the United States has argued in Canada ­ Aircraft II that where there is no comparable financial product on the market, a programme confers benefits per se. It stated:
If the commercial market does not offer a particular borrower the exact terms offered by a government, then the government is providing a benefit to the recipient whenever those terms are more favorable than the terms that are available in the market. A government entity "operating on commercial principles" is still a government entity. It is not the commercial market.146
154. Brazil agrees with the United States. This interpretation is, in fact, consistent with the benchmark established by Article 14(c) of the SCM Agreement. In relevant part, Article 14 provides as follows:
For the purposes of Part V, any method used by the investigating authority to calculate the benefit to the recipient ... shall be transparent and adequately explained. Furthermore, any such method shall be consistent with the following guidelines:
...
(c) a loan guarantee by a government shall not be considered as conferring a benefit, unless there is a difference between the amount that the firm receiving the guarantee pays on a loan guaranteed by the government and the amount that the firm would pay on a comparable commercial loan absent the government guarantee. In this case the benefit shall be the difference between these two amounts adjusted for any differences in fees.
155. Brazil first draws the Panel's attention to the fact that Article 14 was specifically conceived for the purposes of Part V of the SCM Agreement only. It should be referred to exclusively as context to determine whether a benefit exists when a particular transaction is backed by a government export credit guarantee. Secondly, Brazil observes that subparagraph (c) of Article 14 is simply a
146 Panel Report, Canada ­ Aircraft II, WT/DS222/R, Annex C-2 (para. 7).

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-53
"guideline", not the sole method of calculating the benefit to the recipient. Other methods may be applied as long as they are "consistent" with the guideline set out in subparagraph (c).
156. There is no market benchmark in the case of the GSM 102, GSM 103 and SCGP programmes, since there are no financial products available on the market on the terms provided by the programmes. As discussed in response to Question 82, the regulations regarding the GSM 102 and GSM 103 programmes, as well as regarding the SCGP programme note that "[t]he programs operate in cases where credit is necessary to increase or maintain US exports to a foreign market and where US financial institutions would be unwilling to provide financing without CCC's guarantee".147 Moreover, the regulations state that "[t]he programs are targeted towards those countries where the guarantee is necessary to secure financing of the export but which have sufficient financial strength so that foreign exchange will be available for scheduled payments."148 These passages prove that without a CCC guarantee, a borrower would not be able to secure financing at all ­ not just financing on less attractive terms than could be secured with the CCC guarantee (or on terms that would constitute a benefit under Article 14(c) of the SCM Agreement) ­ but no financing at all. The regulations also emphasize that the CCC guarantee is necessary ­ a commercial guarantee would not be sufficient.
157. Moreover, as the FAS website explains, "[t]he reduction of risk to financial institutions in the United States ... may make possible financing that would otherwise be unavailable".149 The FAS further clarifies that "a CCC guarantee can encourage extension of credit in cases where financial institutions might otherwise be unwilling to finance export on credit terms".150 In addition, the FAS points out that such guarantees would "facilitate credit to foreign banks in larger amounts and on more favorable commercial terms than would otherwise be available".151 Whatever the meaning of Article 14(c), the provision by CCC of guarantees that do not exist on the market entails the provision of a benefit per se. The benefit to the recipient, under the benchmark established by Article 14(c), would be the total amount of the loan backed by the guarantee, since there would be no "comparable commercial loan absent the government guarantee".
76. How does the United States respond to Brazil's statement that : "...export credit guarantees for exports of agricultural exports [sic] are not available on the marketplace by commercial lenders"? USA
77. How does the United States interpretation of "long term operating costs and losses" in item (j) as claims paid give meaning to both "costs" and "losses"? Do claims paid represent "losses" or "costs" or both? If claims paid is represented by "losses", what would go into the "cost" element of item (j)? Could the United States expand on why it disagrees with the items which Brazil identifies for inclusion in the examination to be conducted under item (j)? USA
Brazil's Comment:
158. Brazil may wish to comment in its rebuttal submission on the response the United States ultimately provides to this question. In the meantime, however, Brazil would like to comment on US criticisms of the initial formula Brazil constructed to determine whether the GSM 102, GSM 103 and SCGP programmes fail to meet their long-term operating costs and losses, within the meaning of
147 Exhibit Bra-38 (7 CFR 1493.10(a)(2)) and Exhibit Bra-38 (7 CFR 1493.400(a)(2)). 148 Exhibit Bra-38 (7 CFR 1493.10(a)(2)) and Exhibit Bra-38 (7 CFR 1493.400(a)(2)). 149 Exhibit Bra-151 ("US Export Credit Guarantee Programs: What Every Exporter Should Know About The GSM-102 and GSM-103 Programs," USDA, November 1996). 150 Exhibit Bra-151 ("US Export Credit Guarantee Programs: What Every Exporter Should Know About The GSM-102 and GSM-103 Programs," USDA, November 1996). 151 Exhibit Bra-151 ("US Export Credit Guarantee Programs: What Every Exporter Should Know About The GSM-102 and GSM-103 Programs," USDA, November 1996).

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-54
item (j). The Panel will recall that Brazil's initial formula, which was included in paragraph 281 and Figure 20 of its First Submission, can be stated as follows:
Premiums collected ­ (Administrative expenses + Default claims + Interest expenses)
159. Where this formula yields a negative number over a period constituting the "long term", Brazil argued that loan guarantees are provided "at premium rates which are inadequate to cover the long-term operating costs and losses of the programme", within the meaning of item (j).152 Applying this formula to data for the period 1994-2003, Brazil demonstrated that premiums collected for the CCC guarantee programmes were indeed inadequate to cover operating costs and losses for the programmes.
160. To correct for alleged errors in Brazil's initial constructed formula, which was included in paragraph 281 and Figure 20 of its First Submission, the United States adopted its own alternative formula, in paragraph 173 of its First Submission, which can be stated as follows:
(Fees + Claims recovered + Claims rescheduled) ­ Claims paid
161. Where this formula yields a positive number over a period constituting the "long term," the United States asserts that loan guarantees are provided at premium rates that are adequate to cover the long-term operating costs and losses of the program, within the meaning of item (j).
162. Brazil made several criticisms of the US formula. In paragraph 123 of its Statement at the First Panel Meeting, Brazil demonstrated that the failure to account for interest paid by the CCC to the Treasury Department leads to artificially low accounting of operating costs. In paragraph 122, Brazil additionally demonstrated that it is incorrect to treat rescheduled debt as a recovery of a default claim. Brazil notes that rescheduling can in fact have the effect of increasing the costs incurred by the government, rather than reducing those costs. In its budget documents, the US Government treats Paris Club rescheduling of imminent defaults as "work-outs."153 According to the US Office of Management and Budget ("OMB"), work-outs can either have a negative or a positive effect on cash flow.154 The U. General Accounting Office ("GAO") has in fact stated that historically, the majority of GSM support that is rescheduled is "in arrears."155 If anything, this increases CCC's cost.
152 Revenue for "premiums collected" is recorded in the "Financing Account" section of the CCC budget, in the row titled "Loan origination fee" (line 88.40). See the US budget documents included as Exhibits Bra-88 to Bra-95. "Administrative expenses" are recorded in the "Programme Account" section of the CCC budget, in the row titled "Administrative expenses" (line 00.09). See the US budget documents included as Exhibits Bra-88 to Bra-95. Expenses for "default claims" are recorded in the "Financing Account" section of the CCC budget, in the row titled "Default claims" (line 00.01).

163. The United States' formula did correct for one shortcoming of Brazil's initial constructed formula, however. The United States is correct that Brazil's formula did not include recoveries.156
Brazil therefore introduces a revised constructed formula that accounts for recoveries and interest on those recoveries, as recorded in the "Principal collections" and "Interest collections" rows157 of the US
budget. It also accounts for the interest accruing to the CCC on balances maintained in its so-called "financing account" for the purposes of potential claims,158 as recorded in the "Interest on uninvested funds" row of the US budget documents.159 Brazil's revised constructed formula can be stated as
follows (including references to the specific budget lines involved):

(Premiums collected + Recovered principal and interest (Line 88.40) + Interest revenue (Line 88.25)) ­ (Administrative expenses (Line 00.09) + Default claims (Line 00.01) + Interest expense (Line 00.02))

164. Brazil emphasizes that it does not intend for this revised constructed formula to replace the formula used by the US government itself to track the costs of the CCC guarantee programs, pursuant to the US Federal Credit Reform Act ("FCRA"). In paragraphs 124-133 of its Statement at the First Panel Meeting, Brazil discussed the FCRA cost formula in considerable detail. The chart included at paragraph 132 of Brazil's Statement demonstrates that under the FCRA cost formula, CCC's export credit guarantee programs are offered at premium rates that are inadequate to cover their long-term operating costs and losses. Brazil believes that the FCRA cost formula is one very useful way to determine the performance of the CCC guarantee programs relative to the elements of item (j). However, if the Panel would like to confirm the results of the FCRA cost formula, or refer to an alternative formula, Brazil offers its revised constructed formula for these purposes.

165. Where Brazil's revised constructed formula indicates a net cost over a period constituting the "long term", export credit guarantees are provided "at premium rates which are inadequate to cover the long-term operating costs and losses of the programme", within the meaning of item (j). The following chart demonstrates that during the ten-year period FY 1993-2002, premiums for GSM 102, GSM 103 and SCGP export credit guarantees have been inadequate to cover long-term operating costs and losses. Net costs for the programmes during this period total more than $1 billion as set forth below:

consecutive years ­ the prior year, the current year and the budget year. The 2004 budget, for
example, which is completed in 2003, includes data for 2002, 2003 and 2004. Budget year data is

indeed based on estimates. Current year data is revised to account for any change to the cost or revenue item at issue. Since the current year is not yet complete when the budget is issued, however, current year data remains, at least in part, based on estimates. Prior year data, however, is based on actual costs and revenues. In applying its formula, Brazil used the data in the prior year column, and therefore used actual costs and revenues, rather than estimates.198
167. Several other factors corroborate the fact that the CCC export guarantee programmes do not charge premia that allow them to meet their long-term operating costs and losses.
· First, in audit reports of the CCC's fiscal year 2000 and 2001 financial statements, the US Department of Agriculture's Office of the Inspector General noted that "the fees CCC charges for its GSM-102 and GSM-103 export credit guarantee programs have not been changed in 7 years and may not be reflecting current costs."199 While Brazil does not have fee schedules for the entire period 1993-2002, it provides for the Panel's review fee schedules for GSM 102 and GSM 103 from November 1994, 4 September 2001 and 24 September 2002.200 According to CCC's website, the latter is the fee schedule that is currently in force. The Panel will note that between November 1994 and 23 September 2002, CCC made only one change in its fee schedule for GSM 102: while the fee for a 12-month guarantee with semi-annual repayment intervals was $0.209 per $100 of coverage in November 1994, by 4 September 2001 it had changed to $0.229 per $100 of coverage. On 24 September 2002, one additional change was made: borrowers were offered the additional option of 30 and 60 day guarantees, at the same fee charged for 90-day and 4-, 6and 7-month guarantees.
· Second, US Department of Agriculture Under Secretary August Schumacher testified to Congress in 1998 that the GSM 102 programme suffered nearly $2 billion in losses as a result of Iraqi defaults, and an additional nearly $2 billion resulting from Polish defaults.201 GAO stated that liabilities on the Iraqi debt accrued over the period 1990-1997, as the guaranteed Iraqi borrowings came due.202 As noted by Brazil in paragraph 284 of its First Submission, however, the maximum in GSM 102 premiums the United States could have generated from all export credit guarantees provided during the lifetime of the programmes up to 1998 ­ had it applied the highest possible
198 Of the 1994-2003 period tracked in Figure 20 to Brazil's First Submission, the only figures that reflected estimates were those for the year 2003, since actual data is not yet available for that year. To correct this, and to ensure that the data is still sufficient to reveal whether the CCC export credit guarantee programmes incur "long term" operating costs and losses, the chart above tracks CCC guarantees for the period 1993-2002.
199 Exhibit Bra-153 (US Department of Agriculture Office of Inspector General Financial and IT Operations Audit Report of the Commodity Credit Corporation's Financial Statements for Fiscal Year 2000, Audit Report No. 06401-14-FM (June 2001), p. 31). See also Exhibit Bra-154 (US Department of Agriculture Office of Inspector General Great Plains Region Audit Report of the Commodity Credit Corporation's Financial Statements for Fiscal Year 2001, Audit Report No. 06401-4-KC (February 2002), p. 49 ("[T]he fees CCC charged for its GSM-102 and GSM-103 export credit guarantee programmes have not been changed for many years and may not be reflecting current costs.").

Brazil was unable to locate from public sources other fee schedules from the period 1993-2002.

premium rate to all guarantees ­ is $358.54 million.203 The total amount of received applications for GSM 102 export credit guarantees for the period 1999-2002 was $11.77 billion, resulting in a theoretical additional maximum premium of $78.08 million for that period.204 Thus, the highest amount of premiums the United States could have generated under this programme from its inception through 2002 would amount to $436.62 million.205 This does not come close to covering the programme's losses from the Iraqi and Polish defaults alone.
· Third, CCC financial statements for fiscal year 2002 report that uncollectible amounts on post1991 CCC guarantees total $770 million.206 As noted in the chart above at paragraph 165, CCC collected premiums of $222.641 million for GSM 102, GSM 103 and SCGP during the period 1992-2002.207 Thus, even without accounting for other operating costs, or for receivables that CCC hopes to collect but may not, losses for the CCC export credit guarantee programmes outpace premiums during the period 1992-2002 by nearly $550 million.
· Fourth, CCC's 2002 financials also report uncollectible amounts on pre-1992 CCC guarantees of $2.567 billion.208 While actual data concerning premiums during the period 1981-1991 (from the first year GSM 102 was available until the last year before credit reform was introduced with the Federal Credit Reform Act) is not publicly available, Brazil has applied a proxy based on the average annual fees collected during the period 1992-2002 ($20.24 million). Multiplying $20.24 million by the 11 years included in the 1981-1991 period results in total fees of $222.64 million. Thus, even without accounting for other operating costs, or for receivables that CCC hopes to collect but does not, losses for the CCC export credit guarantee programs outpace premiums during the period 1981-1991 by more than $2.3 billion.
· Finally, the US General Accounting Office ("GAO") estimated in 1992 that if GSM 102 and GSM 103 continued until 2007, costs for the programs would reach $7.6 billion.209 Premium fees
203 See Exhibit Bra-73 ("Summary of Export Credit Guarantee Programme Activity", USDA, covering GSM 102, GSM 103 and SCGP for US fiscal years 1999-2003) for the total amounts of allocations. These have been multiplied by 0.663 percent to obtain the theoretical maximum premium.
204 Exhibit Bra-73 ("Summary of Export Credit Guarantee Programme Activity", USDA, covering GSM 102, GSM 103 and SCGP for US fiscal years 1999-2003).
205 This amount is a substantial overstatement, as premiums for periods of coverage shorter than 3 years will yield substantially lower premiums of as low as 15.3 cents per $100 as compared to 66.3 cents for a 3-year coverage. Exhibit Bra-98 ("Guarantee Fee Rate Schedule Under GSM 102 and GSM 103").
206 Exhibit Bra-158 (US Department of Agriculture, Office of Inspector General, Financial and IT Operations, Audit Report, Commodity Credit Corporation's Financial Statements for Fiscal Year 2002, Audit Report No. 06401-15-FM (December 2002), Notes to the Financial Statements, p. 14). This figure theoretically includes not only uncollectible amounts for the GSM 102, GSM 103 and SCGP programs, but also uncollectible amounts for CCC's Facility Guarantee Programme ("FGP"). Brazil has not challenged the FGP in this dispute. Brazil notes, however, that in fiscal years 1999-2003 (for which programme activity data is available on CCC's website, at http://www.fas.usda.gov/excredits/Monthly/ecg.html), exporter applications were only received for a total of $4.8 million in coverage under the FGP. Thus, defaults on FGP guarantees, if any, would contribute only negligibly to the $770 million figure discussed above.
207 The chart in paragraph 165 does not include premiums for 1992. Those premiums totalled $36.14 million. See Exhibit Bra-125 (US budget for FY 1994, p. 383). According to US budget documents, premiums for the FGP are included in the budget line item for fees on the GSM and SCGP programs.

The FGP did not exist during this period, and thus is not a factor.

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-59
for the period 1992-2007 (assuming current rates) would only reach $323.84,210 demonstrating that fees for the programme do not meet costs.
In sum, CCC financials state that during the period 1981-2002, costs and losses for CCC export credit guarantee programmes exceeded premiums collected.
78. Can the United States provide supporting documentation for data used relating to "costs and losses" in paragraph 173? Could the United States confirm that the figures cited in paragraph 173 of its first written submission relate to the SCGP? Why did the United States cite these figures after stating that it is not possible to make any assessment of the long-term operating costs and losses of this programme? USA
79. In respect of what time periods does Article 13(c) require an assessment of conformity with Part V of the Agreement on Agriculture? How does this affect, if at all, your interpretation of Article 13(b)? BRA, USA
Brazil's Answer:
168. Part V of the Agreement on Agriculture requires that Members grant export subsidies in conformity with that agreement and with that Member's export subsidy reduction commitments. These commitments are made on a commodity specific basis.211 The relevant section of the US Schedule of Concessions (Part IV, Section II) clarifies that the US export subsidy commitments are to be assessed on a US fiscal year basis.212 A Member's export subsidy reduction commitments cover annual budgetary outlays and quantitative reduction commitments ­ in the US case on a fiscal year basis.213 It follows that the US compliance with its export subsidy reduction commitments must be assessed on the basis of specific agricultural products and fiscal years.
169. Thus, similar to domestic support measures, the conformity of a Member's export subsidies with Part V of the Agreement on Agriculture must be assessed by comparing the amounts actually granted (both in term of budgetary outlays as well as in terms of quantities of specific agricultural products benefiting from export subsidies) with a benchmark, i.e., with a Member's export subsidy reduction commitments.
170. According to Article 3.3 of the Agreement on Agriculture, for agricultural products not included in Part IV, Section II of a Member's Schedule (i.e. unscheduled products) any export subsidy granted leads to a violation of Part V of the Agreement on Agriculture. Brazil's claims against Step 2 export subsidies and against ETI Act subsidies benefiting upland cotton fall in this category, as the United States does not have an export subsidy reduction commitment for upland cotton.214 Furthermore, Brazil's claims concerning export credit guarantee programs fall in this category, in as far as export credit guarantees are available for unscheduled agricultural products.
GSM programmes will cost the Corporation about $6.7 billion in the long run . . . This estimate assumes that the outstanding loans and guarantees remain at the same level for about 16 years and that their average risk remains unchanged as new guarantees replace old ones).
210 This has been calculated based on actual fees for 1992-2002 and using average 1992-2002 fees as expected fees for the remainder of the time period (2003-2007).
211 See Brazil's answer to Question 7. 212 Exhibit Bra-83 (Schedule XX of the United States of America, Part IV, Section II entitled Export Subsidies: Budgetary Outlays and Quantitative Reduction Commitments). 213 Exhibit Bra-83 (Schedule XX of the United States of America, Part IV, Section II entitled Export Subsidies: Budgetary Outlays and Quantitative Reduction Commitments). 214 Exhibit Bra-83 (Schedule XX of the United States of America, Part IV, Section II entitled Export Subsidies: Budgetary Outlays and Quantitative Reduction Commitments).

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-60
171. For scheduled agricultural products, the Panel needs to determine whether the export subsidies for a particular scheduled agricultural product are in excess of the export subsidy reduction commitment levels for that agricultural product in the year in question, or whether the application of the export subsidies threatens to lead to circumvention of the export subsidy reduction commitments. More specifically, in this dispute, the Panel needs to assess whether the CCC export credit guarantee programmes threaten to circumvent the export subsidy reduction commitments of the United States for scheduled agricultural products.
80. In Brazil's view, why did the drafters of the Agreement on Agriculture not include export credit guarantees in Article 9.1? BRA
Brazil's Answer:
172. The negotiating history of the Agreement on Agriculture does not reveal why the drafters did not include export credits guarantees in Article 9.1, just as it does not reveal why the drafters did not include well-known and widely-used export subsidies like the United States' FSC regime in Article 9.1. Yet, the Appellate Body concluded that the FSC regime constitutes an export subsidy and is subject to the general export subsidy disciplines in the Agreement on Agriculture, including Article 10.1 thereto. As Brazil has previously noted, Article 1(e) defines export subsidies as "including" those listed in Article 9.1 of the Agreement on Agriculture, and Article 10.1 refers to a universe of export subsidies "not listed in" Article 9.1. As the Appellate Body's report in US ­ FSC illustrates, if a measure meets the definition of "export subsidy", it is subject to Article 10.1, even though it is not included in Article 9.1.
173. Under the Vienna Convention rules, Articles 9.1 and 10.1, as well as Article 10.2 of the Agreement on Agriculture, are to be interpreted according to their ordinary meaning, in their context, and according to the object and purpose of the Agreement on Agriculture. Brazil has demonstrated that the CCC export credit guarantee programs fulfill the definition of "export subsidy" in the Agreement on Agriculture and the SCM Agreement, and that export credit guarantees are not, under a Vienna Convention interpretation of Article 10.2, excluded from the general export subsidy disciplines in Article 10.1.

Brazil's Comment on Question 81(g):
174. Brazil may wish to comment in its rebuttal submission on the response the United States ultimately provides to this and the other sub-parts of question 81. In the meantime, however, Brazil would like to comment on the distinction between actual and estimated costs and losses.
175. As noted above in comments on Question 77, Brazil has used data from the prior year column of the US budget. This column is titled "actual," since it reflects reconciled data for a full fiscal year. Data reported in the prior year column of the "guaranteed loan subsidy" row of the US budget is "actual" in this sense. Brazil explained in paragraph 127 of its Statement at the First Panel Meeting that the FCRA calls for the CCC to make annual "reestimates" to the cost calculation and thus to the "guaranteed loan subsidy" line in the budget. Reestimates "take into account all factors that may have affected the estimate of each component of the cash flows, including prepayments, defaults, delinquencies, and recoveries,"215 to the extent that those factors have changed since the initial estimate was made for purposes of the budget year column of the budget.
176. The results of the reestimate process are captured in the US budget and in CCC's financial statements.216 Reestimates made in a given fiscal year are netted and recorded in the "reestimates of subsidy" (line 00.07) and "interest on reestimate" (line 00.08) lines of the US budget. In the 2002 column of the 2004 budget, for example, "reestimates of subsidy" were recorded in the amount of $118 million, and "interest on reestimate" was recorded as $8 million.217 In the 2002 column of the 2004 budget, the United States in fact aggregates these two amounts with the "guaranteed loan subsidy" amount of $97 million and the "administrative expenses" of $4 million to arrive at a total subsidy of $227 million (which is in turn deducted from the budgetary resources available to the CCC in line 23.95 of the budget).218 While Brazil could have followed this same convention to accentuate the amount by which the CCC guarantee programmes' costs and losses outstrip revenue by even more than that listed in the chart included in paragraph 132 of Brazil's Statement to the First Panel Meeting, it chose to be conservative and did not do so.
177. The results of the reestimate process are also captured in a cumulative, "running tally" of the FCRA subsidy figure included in CCC's annual financial statements. CCC's fiscal year 2002 financial statements track the "credit guarantee liability" for post-1991 guarantees disbursed under the CCC export guarantee programmes. "Credit guarantee liability" is defined in the CCC financials as representing "the estimated net cash outflows (loss) of the guarantees on a net present value basis."219 The Panel will recall that the "guaranteed loan subsidy" line in the US budget similarly tracks the net present value of payments to and from the government for CCC export guarantees, although only with respect to guarantees disbursed in one particular year. The 2002 financial statement provides a cumulative subsidy figure for all post-1991 guarantees under the CCC programmes. The analysis included in the 2002 financial statement begins with the credit guarantee liability included in the 2001

financial statement, makes adjustments for defaults, fees and reestimates undertaken in fiscal year 2002 with respect to all post-1991 guarantees, and results in a new subsidy figure of $411 million for those post-1991 guarantees.220 This positive net present value means that CCC has "los[t] money" during the period 1992-2002.221
178. While Brazil has demonstrated that the reestimation process applied to the FCRA formula does in fact track actual data and does in fact account for actual performance of CCC export credit guarantees, Brazil notes that a certain degree of estimated data would be perfectly acceptable in an analysis of the costs and losses of guarantee programs under item (j). The purpose of the FCRA and its cost formula was, after all, "to measure more accurately the costs of Federal credit programmes," including contingent liabilities like export credit guarantees.222 As the United States evidently agrees, accounting for the costs of contingent liabilities like guarantees on a cash basis is not appropriate, since it masks the real costs of those guarantees. Even if the FCRA cost formula does entail the use of some estimated data, the US Congress and the President consider that that formula is the most accurate way of tracking costs.
179. Brazil notes, finally, that it is not entirely accurate to call the data used to arrive at initial estimates of the "guaranteed loan subsidy" figure "estimated" data. The US Federal Accounting Standards Advisory Board, the Government-Wide Audited Financial Statements Task Force on Credit Reform, the Office of Management and Budget and the Department of Agriculture itself have emphasized that "[m]ethods of estimating future cash flows for existing credit programs need to take account of past experience,"223 that "[a]ctual historical experience of the performance of a risk category is a primary factor upon which an estimation of default cost is based",224 and that the technical assumptions underlying subsidy calculations reflect "historical cash reports and loan performance".225 This demonstrates that "estimates" of the subsidy cost of CCC guarantees are informed by actual historical experience with borrowers.
180. Brazil also notes that a number of factors involved in setting the FCRA subsidy cost are "explicit" and not "forecast". The Office of Management and Budget identifies contract terms such as maturity, borrower's interest rate, fees and grace periods as "explicit," and therefore not "estimated".226 Moreover, as the Panel is well aware, none of the "reestimates" at issue is Brazil's. They are all estimates by official agencies of the United States.

82. Please explain each of the following statements and any possible significance it may have in respect of Brazil's claims about GSM-102 and GSM-103 (7 CFR 1493.10(a)(2), Exhibit BRA38): BRA, USA
Brazil's Answer:
181. As discussed below, these passages corroborate evidence provided by Brazil to demonstrate that the CCC guarantee programmes constitute export subsidies within the meaning of Articles 1.1 and 3.1(a) of the SCM Agriculture, and thus within the meaning of Articles 1(e), 10.1 and 8 of the Agreement on Agriculture.
(a) "The programmes operate in cases where credit is necessary to increase or maintain US exports to a foreign market and where US financial institutions would be unwilling to provide financing without CCC's guarantee. (7 CFR 1493.10(a)(2) Exhibit BRA-38)
Brazil's Answer:
182. The passage cited by the Panel provides corroborating evidence that CCC guarantees provide "benefits", within the meaning of Article 1.1(b) of the SCM Agreement. Specifically, the passage states that the CCC programmes "operate in cases . . . where US financial institutions would be unwilling to provide financing without CCC's guarantee". This demonstrates at least two things. First, it establishes that the CCC guarantee programs are used in situations where, without a CCC guarantee, a borrower could not secure financing at all ­ not just financing on less attractive terms than could be secured with the CCC guarantee (or on terms that would constitute a benefit under Article 14(c) of the SCM Agreement), but no financing at all. Second, it establishes that financing could not be secured without a CCC guarantee ­ a commercial guarantee would not do. This corroborates Brazil's assertion that CCC provides something that has no equivalent on the commercial market.
183. Brazil notes that the regulations for the SCGP programme contain an identical provision, in 7 CFR 1493.400(a)(2). That section states that "[t]he SCGP operates in cases where credit is necessary to increase or maintain US exports to a foreign market and where private US exporters would be unwilling to provide financing without CCC's guarantee".227
184. Moreover, in its Annual Performance Plans for fiscal years 2000, 2001 and 2002, the US Department of Agriculture's Foreign Agricultural Service similarly stated that the SCGP programme "was created to expand high-value product exports by facilitating credit for such purchases in foreign markets lacking sufficient liquidity to purchase openly on the commercial market".228 This demonstrates that the SCGP programme extends "benefits," since it facilitates credit for the purchase of US agricultural commodities in circumstances where credit would not otherwise be available at all.
(b) "The programmes are operated in a manner intended not to interfere with markets for cash sales. The programs are targeted toward those countries where the guarantee is necessary to secure financing of the exports but which have sufficient financial strength so that foreign exchange will be available for scheduled payments." (7 CFR 1493.10(a)(2) Exhibit BRA-38)
227 Exhibit Bra-38 (7 CFR 1493.400 et seq.). 228 Exhibit Bra-164 (US Department of Agriculture, Foreign Agricultural Service, Revised FY 2001 and FY 2002 Annual Performance Plan, p. 11); Exhibit Bra-165 (US Department of Agriculture, Foreign Agricultural Service, Revised FY 2000 and FY 2001 Annual Performance Plan, p. 17).

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-64
Brazil's Answer:
185. This passage also demonstrates that CCC guarantees confer "benefits". Specifically, the passage states that "[t]he programmes are targeted toward those countries where the guarantee is necessary to secure financing of the exports . . .". Like the passage included in 82(a), this passage establishes at least two things. First, that without a CCC guarantee, a borrower would not be able to secure financing at all ­ not just financing on less attractive terms than could be secured with the CCC guarantee (or on terms that would constitute a benefit under Article 14(c) of the SCM Agreement), but no financing at all. Second, that the CCC guarantee is necessary ­ a commercial guarantee would not be sufficient.
186. Brazil notes that the regulations for the SCGP programme contain an identical provision, in 7 CFR 1493.400(a)(2). That section states that "The programme is operated in a manner intended not to interfere with markets for cash sales. The programme is targeted toward those countries where the guarantees are necessary to secure financing of the exports but which have sufficient financial strength so that foreign exchange will be available for scheduled payments."229
(c) "In providing this credit guarantee facility, CCC seeks to expand market opportunities for US agricultural exporters and assist long-term market development for US agricultural commodities." (7 CFR 1493.10(a)(2) Exhibit BRA-38)
Brazil's Answer:
187. This passage demonstrates that the CCC guarantee programmes are contingent on export, within the meaning of Article 3.1(a) of the SCM Agreement. Specifically, the passage establishes that the CCC guarantee programs are for use by "US agricultural exporters". It also confirms that the programmes operate to the benefit of US exporters, who with the help of the programmes are able to expand their market share.
188. Brazil notes that the regulations for the SCGP programme contain an identical provision, in 7 CFR 1493.400(a)(2). That section states that "[i]n providing this credit guarantee facility, CCC seeks to expand market opportunities for US agricultural exporters and assist long-term market development for US agricultural commodities."230
83. Could Brazil explain how the procedure in Annex V of the SCM Agreement would be relevant to its claims concerning agricultural export subsidies, prohibited subsidies and agricultural domestic support? (e.g. note 301 in Brazil's first submission and paragraph 4 of Brazil's oral statement at the first session of the first substantive meeting). BRA
Brazil's Answer:
189. The United States failed to respond to Brazil's questions and document requests during the Annex V procedures. Indeed, the United States refused to participate in any way in the Annex V procedures mandated by Brazil's invocation of Annex V in its request for establishment of this Panel. This refusal to participate has consequences under the express terms of Annex V. The list of Annex V questions provided to the United States by Brazil is included in Exhibit Bra-49. As directed by paragraph 6 of Annex V, given the United States' failure to cooperate in the Annex V informationgathering process, Brazil has and will present its case regarding peace clause issues and serious prejudice claims based on evidence available to it. If there are gaps in the evidence provided to the Panel by Brazil in support of its prima facie case, and those gaps are due to the United States' failure

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-65
to cooperate with and participate in the Annex V process, Annex V, paragraph 6 provides that "the panel may complete the record as necessary relying on best information otherwise available".
190. As a final note, Brazil's Annex V questions to the United States included questions concerning US agricultural export subsidies and domestic content subsidies because these are also "actionable" subsidies that cause serious prejudice to Brazil's interests.
84. Is the Panel correct in understanding that, under the GSM-102 and GSM-103 programmes, the exporter pays a fee calculated on the dollar amount guaranteed, based on a schedule of rates applicable to different credit periods? How and on what basis are the fee rates fixed? Do the fee rates ever change? If so, how and for what reason? Would it be necessary to amend the legislation and/or regulations in order to adjust the fee rates? USA
Brazil's Comment:
191. The Panel is correct in stating that fees for GSM 102 and GSM 103 guarantees vary only according to the dollar value of the transaction and the length of the guarantee. GSM 102 and GSM 103 fees do not otherwise vary and are charged according to a fee schedule that does not account for the country risk involved or the credit rating of the borrower. Brazil attaches news releases from the US Department of Agriculture's Foreign Agricultural Service announcing GSM 102 and GSM 103 guarantees to Dominican Republic, Morocco, Ghana, South Korea, Vietnam and Algeria.231 The Panel will note that the fees do not vary, and are based on the standard GSM 102 and GSM 103 fee schedule included as Exhibit Bra-155.232
192. As noted above in Brazil's comment on Question 77, the US Department of Agriculture's Office of the Inspector General has noted in June 2001 that "the fees CCC charges for its GSM-102 and GSM-103 export credit guarantee programmes have not been changed in 7 years and may not be reflecting current costs".233 It repeated this statement in February 2002.234 Thus, GSM 102 and GSM 103 fees remained virtually unchanged from at least 1994 until February 2002. The current fee schedule demonstrates that this trend continues to the present.235
193. In reviewing the historical fee schedules available from public sources,236 Brazil notes that from at least 1994 until the present, CCC made two changes in its fee schedule for GSM 102. First, it

Brazil was unable to locate from public sources other fee schedules from the period 1993-2002.

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-66
changed the fee for a 12-month guarantee with semi-annual repayment intervals from $0.209 per $100 of coverage to $0.229 per $100 of coverage. Second, it decided to offer borrowers the additional option of 30- and 60-day guarantees, at the same fee charged for 90-day and 4-, 6- and 7-month guarantees.
85. Is the Panel correct in understanding that, under the SCGP, the exporter pays a fee for the guarantee calculated on the guaranteed portion of the value of the export sales? How and on what basis are the fee rates fixed? Do the fee rates ever change? If so, how and for what reason? Would it be necessary to amend the legislation and/or regulations in order to adjust the fee rates? Please explain any "risk" assessment involved in the programme. USA
Brazil's Comment:
194. The Panel is correct in stating that fees for SCGP guarantees vary only according to the dollar value of the transaction and the length of the guarantee. SCGP fees do not otherwise vary and are charged according to a fee schedule that does not account for the country risk involved or the credit rating of the borrower. For SCGP guarantees of up to 90 days, the fee is $0.45 per $100 of coverage, and for SCGP guarantees from 90-180 days, the fee is $0.90 per $100 of coverage.237 Brazil attaches news releases from the US Department of Agriculture's Foreign Agricultural Service announcing SCGP guarantees to Tunisia, Azerbaijan, Vietnam, South Korea, Japan and Nigeria.238 The Panel will note that the fees do not vary.
86. Is there a risk categorization in relation to three export credit guarantee programmes (GSM-102, GSM-103 and SCGP)? Does this have any impact on premiums payable and the ability of the CCC to on-sell the guarantees ? USA
Brazil's Comment:
195. Fees for GSM 102, GSM 103 and SCGP guarantees do not vary depending upon the credit rating of the borrower. As noted in Brazil's comments on Questions 84 and 85, guarantee fees for these three programs vary only according to the dollar value of the transaction and the length of the guarantee. Fees do not otherwise vary and are charged according to a fee schedule that does not account for the country risk involved or the credit rating of the borrower.
196. In calculating the "subsidy cost" for the purposes of the Federal Credit Reform Act, agencies like the CCC account for country risk. According to the narrative description included in the US budget,
[t]he subsidy estimates for the GSM-102 and GSM-103 programs are determined in large part by the obligor's sovereign or non-sovereign country risk grade. These grades are developed annually by the International Credit Risk Assessment System Committee (ICRAS). . . . The default estimates for GSM guarantees are determined in large part by the risk premia assigned for each risk grade.239
197. According to the GAO, "OMB requires executive branch agencies to calculate the costs of foreign loans and guarantees using annually updated ICRAS ratings and . . . country risk interest premiums when foreign loans or guarantees are budgeted, authorized, disbursed, or modified. . . ."240
237 Exhibit Bra-167 (12 Steps to Participating in the USDA Supplier Credit Guarantee Programme, Step 5).

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-67
198. Thus, while CCC fees for GSM 102, GSM 103 and SCGP fees do not account for country risk or the credit risk of the borrower, the "guaranteed loan subsidy" line in the US budget and the subsidy figures in the CCC's financial statements do take account of country risk.
87. What proportion of CCC (export-related and total) long term operating costs and losses are represented by GSM-102, GSM-103 and SCGP programmes? USA
88. (a) Is the Panel correct in understanding that the United States' argument is that, at present, by virtue of Article 10.2 of the Agreement on Agriculture, there are no disciplines on agricultural export credit guarantees under the Agreement on Agriculture (or the SCM Agreement)? USA
(b) Does the United States agree with the following proposition: a WTO Member may therefore extend agricultural export credit guarantees without charging a premium, and for an indefinite period, in addition to any other terms and conditions it may wish? How would this reconcile with the title of Article 10 of the Agreement on Agriculture ("Prevention of Circumvention on Export Subsidy Commitments"), and with other commitments contained in the Agreement on Agriculture? Please cite any relevant material, including any past WTO dispute settlement cases. How would this reconcile with the United States' own statement, at paragraph 21 of its closing oral statement that "of course, the United States may not provide subsidies without any limit". USA
(c) If, as the United States argues, there are no disciplines on export credit guarantees in the Agreement on Agriculture, how could export credit guarantees "conform fully to the provisions of Part V" of the Agreement on Agriculture within the meaning of Article 13 (how can you assess "conformity" or nonconformity when there are allegedly no disciplines against which such an assessment could occur)? USA
Brazil's Comment:
199. As the Panel's question suggests, if the Panel determines that export credit guarantees are not subject to the export subsidy disciplines in the Agreement on Agriculture, the United States is nevertheless not entitled to the protection afforded by Article 13(c). Article 13(c) provides an exemption from action for those export subsidies that "conform fully to the provisions of Part V" of the Agriculture Agreement. If, as the United States argues, export credit guarantees are not subject to Part V, then they cannot "conform fully to the provisions of Part V," and are not entitled to the safe haven in Article 13(c).
200. The panel in Canada ­ Aircraft (21.5) took a similar approach with respect to the safe haven included in the second paragraph of item (k) to the Illustrative List of Export Subsidies appended to the SCM Agreement.241 The second paragraph of item (k) provides as follows:
Provided, however, that if a Member is a party to an international undertaking on official export credits to which at least twelve original Members to this Agreement are parties as of 1 January 1979 (or a successor undertaking which has been adopted by those original Members), or if in practice a Member applies the interest rates provisions of the relevant undertaking, an export credit practice which is in conformity with those provisions shall not be considered an export subsidy prohibited by this Agreement.
241 Panel Report, Canada ­ Aircraft (21.5), para. 5.143-5.145.

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-68
The "international undertaking on official export credits" cited in this provision is the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development's Arrangement on Guidelines for Officially Supported Export Credits ("OECD Arrangement").242
201. To determine whether a particular Canadian measure could benefit from the safe haven in the second paragraph of item (k), the Panel first reviewed which types of "export credit practices" could potentially be "in conformity with" the "interest rates provisions" of the OECD Arrangement. According to the Panel, it could only "determine the conformity of a given export credit practice with those interest rate provisions . . . [if] it is of the type that conceptually could be subject to, and thus in conformity with, those provisions".243 Similarly, if the United States is correct that CCC export credit guarantees are not subject to the disciplines in Part V of the Agriculture Agreement, then CCC guarantees cannot logically "conform fully to the provisions of Part V" and trigger the exemption from action provided for in Article 13(c).
(d) Is the United States advocating the view that its own export credit guarantee programmes, which pre-dated the Uruguay Round, are effectively "grandfathered" so as to benefit from some sort of exemption from the export subsidy disciplines of the Agreement on Agriculture? How, if at all, is it relevant that the SCGP did not, according to the United States, become relevant for upland cotton until the late 1990's (i.e. after the entry into force of the WTO Agreement)? USA
F. STEP 2 PAYMENTS
89. Does the United States confirm Brazil's statement in paragraph 331 of its first submission that "The conditions and requirements for Step 2 domestic payments remain unchanged with the passage of the 2002 FSRI Act"? What is the relevance of this, if any, to this dispute? USA
90. Does the United States confirm Brazil's statement in paragraph 235 of its first submission that the changes concerning Step 2 export payments from the 1996 FAIR Act to the 2002 FSRI Act are: increase in the amount of the subsidy by 1.25 cents per pound and the removal of any budgetary limits that applied under the 1996 FAIR Act? What is the relevance of this, if any, to this dispute? USA
91. What is the significance of the elimination of the 1.25 cent threshold payment in the 2002 FSRI Act pertaining to Step 2 payments? USA
92. Does the United States confirm that Exhibit BRA-65 represents a sample contract for exporters of eligible upland cotton to conclude with the CCC under the FSRI 2002, and that an application form (Exhibit BRA-66) needs to be filled out with data on weekly exports and submitted to the USDA FAS. Is Exhibit BRA-66 - Form CCC 1045-2 ­ also a valid example? If not, please identify any differences or distinctions. USA
242 Available at http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/52/3/2763846.pdf. 243 WT/DS70/RW, para. 5.93. The Panel concluded that "the only forms of export credit practices" subject to the interest rate provisions of the OECD Arrangement are "direct credits/financing, refinancing and interest rate support," since only those forms of official financing support are subject to the Arrangement's commercial interest reference rates ("CIRR") ­ "the only existing systems of minimum interest rates under the Arrangement." Id., paras. 5.98, 5.101 (emphasis in original). Since the CIRR are only expressed as fixed rates, the Panel concluded that they could only be applied to fixed (and not floating) interest rate transactions. Id., para. 5.102. Nor could the CIRR be applied to official support with a shorter maturity than two years (the minimum term expressly listed in the OECD Arrangement), or to guarantees or insurance. Id., para. 5.106.

Brazil's Comment:
202. Brazil includes a new version of the current "Upland Cotton Domestic User/Exporter Agreement" (Revision 7, in effect as of 1 August 2003 and issued on 17 June 2003), which replaces Revision 6 that Brazil has included as Exhibit Bra-65 to its First Submission.
93. Please elaborate why the United States deems that Step 2 payments upon submission of proof of export are not subsidies contingent upon export. Is it the US contention that, in order to be contingent on export, exportation must be the exclusive condition for receipt of the payment? USA
94. Is the Panel correct in understanding that Brazil alleges an inconsistency with Article 3.1(b) of the SCM Agreement only with respect to Step 2 domestic payments? BRA
Brazil's Answer:
203. Yes.
95. Do the criteria in 7 CFR 1427.103(c)(2) (Exhibit BRA-37) that Step 2 "eligible upland cotton" must be "not imported cotton" apply to both domestic and export payments? USA
96. Is a domestic sale a "use" for the purposes of Step 2 payments? Is a sale for export, or export, considered a "use"? USA
97. How does the United States respond to Brazil's assertion, at paragraph 70 of Brazil's oral statement at the first session of the first substantive meeting, that "It is obvious that a single bale of cotton cannot be both exported and used domestically." Is this a relevant consideration? USA
98. How many Step 2 payments are received if a bale of upland cotton is exported, and then opened by a domestic user in the United States, or vice versa? USA
99. How does the United States respond to Brazil's arguments in paragraphs 71-75 of Brazil's oral statement at the first session of the first Panel meeting concerning the relevance of the Appellate Body Report in US-FSC (21.5). USA
100. How does Brazil respond to the statement in note 119 of the United States' first written submission that "...to the extent a consumer that had intended to export instead opens the bale, then that consumer could still obtain the Step 2 payment upon submission of the requisite documentation". The Panel notes that Step 2 payments all involve upland cotton produced in the United States. What are the two distinct factual situations that Step 2 payments involve? Other than the panel report in Canada-Dairy and the findings of the Appellate Body in US-FSC (21.5)244, do any other dispute settlement reports offer guidance on this issue? For example, how, if at all is the Appellate Body's report in Canada-Aircraft relevant here?245 BRA
244 "We recall that the ETI measure grants a tax exemption in two different sets of circumstances: (a) where property is produced within the United States and held for use outside the United States; and (b) where property is produced outside the United States and held for use outside the United States. Our conclusion that the ETI measure grants subsidies that are export contingent in the first set of circumstances is not affected by the fact that the subsidy can also be obtained in the second set of circumstances. The fact that the subsidies granted in the second set of circumstances might not be export contingent does not dissolve the export contingency arising in the first set of circumstances. 244 Conversely, the export contingency arising in these circumstances has no bearing on whether there is an export contingent subsidy in the second set of circumstances. Where a United States taxpayer is simultaneously producing property within and outside the United States, for direct use

Brazil's Answer:
204. The applicable regulations (7 CFR 1427.104)246 define eligible domestic users and exporters of upland cotton.247 To receive a Step 2 export payment, a person (including a cotton producer or a cooperative) must be "regularly engaged in selling eligible [US] upland cotton for export".248 To receive a domestic payment, a person must be "regularly engaged in the business of opening bales of eligible [US] upland cotton to manufacture US upland cotton into cotton products in the United States".249 The only actor who can be indifferent whether they export or use cotton domestically is a hypothetical domestic US cotton product manufacturer regularly engaged in opening US bales for domestic US manufacture that also regularly engages in exporting US cotton. In that situation, if a bale of cotton is opened by mistake instead of being exported, the exporter who is also the US cotton product manufacturer will receive a Step 2 domestic payment for that bale if the company has already entered into a contract with CCC for Step 2 payments, and subject to proof that bale is in fact used for manufacturing cotton products in the United States. But even if that hypothetical situation were to occur, then the payment would be contingent upon the domestic use of only US upland cotton (prohibited by Article 3.1(b) of the SCM Agreement). And if the bale were exported, the US exporter would receive the Step 2 payments subject to proof of export of US (not foreign) upland cotton (prohibited by Article 3.1(a) of the SCM Agreement).
205. It follows that the "two distinct factual situations" resulting in the payment of Step 2 subsidies are (1) the domestic "use" of eligible US upland cotton by a manufacturer of cotton products regularly engaged in opening bales; and (2) the "export" of eligible US cotton by exporters regularly engaged in selling US upland cotton. The United States argues that this case is distinguishable from US ­ FSC (21.5) because in that case one situation involved property produced within the United States and held for use outside the United States, and the other situation involved property produced outside the United States and held for use outside the United States.250 This is irrelevant.
206. The point of the distinction by the Appellate Body in US ­ FSC (21.5) was not the geographic location of the property at issue, but rather whether one portion of payment under a programME was export contingent. In fact, in US ­ FSC (21.5), the products found to be subject to the export contingency were those produced within the United States and held for use outside the United States. This is exactly the situation with Step 2 export payments. Upland cotton produced in the United States receives Step 2 payment upon proof of export ("held for use outside the United States") outside the United States. As in US ­ FSC (21.5), the fact that subsidies available under the programme are also granted in a second situation, i.e., when upland cotton produced within the United States is used within the United States "does not dissolve the export contingency arising in the first set of circumstances".251
outside the United States, subsidies may be granted under the ETI measure in respect of both sets of property. The subsidy granted with respect to the property produced within the United States, and exported from there, is export contingent within the meaning of Article 3.1(a) of the SCM Agreement, irrespective of whether the subsidy given in respect of property produced outside the United States is also export contingent."
245 There, the Appellate Body stated that, "the fact that some of TPC's contributions, in some industry sectors, are not contingent upon export performance, does not necessarily mean that the same is true for all of TPC's contributions. It is enough to show that one or some of TPC's contributions do constitute subsidies "contingent ... in fact ... upon export performance". 246 Exhibit Bra-37 (7 CFR 1427.104). 247 First Submission of Brazil, paras 92, 98. 248 Exhibit Bra-37 (7 CFR 1427.104(a)(2)). 249 Exhibit Bra-37 (7 CFR 1427.104(a)(1)). 250 First Oral Statement of the United States, paras. 21-22. 251 Appellate Body Report, US ­ FSC (21.5), para. 119.

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-71
207. Concerning other relevant dispute settlement reports, Brazil believes that the Canada ­ Aircraft decision is useful precedent. In that case, Canada argued that Technology Partnership Canada (TPC) was a funding mechanism providing "support to a broad base of sectors and technologies" "that result in a high technology product or process for sale in domestic and export markets".252 Canada claimed that "Brazil has not adduced any evidence to show that TPC contributions are contingent on export performance, in the sense that the contributions would not be paid unless exports took place, that there would be rewards if exports took place. . .".253 The Appellate Body affirmed the panel's finding of export contingency, noting that "it is enough to show that one or some of TPC's contributions do constitute subsidies `contingent . . . in fact . . . upon export performance.'"254 This finding is consistent with the Appellate Body's later decision in US ­ FSC (21.5). It stands for the proposition that where a programme makes some payments contingent upon export of products, the fact that other payments under the programme are made for domestic use does not eliminate the export contingency of the programmes.
101. How does Brazil respond to the United States' assertion at paragraph 22 of its oral statement that the programme involves "eligible users" who constitute the "entire universe" of potential purchasers of upland cotton? BRA
Brazil's Answer:
208. Brazil considers that the United States' statement is not correct. As noted in the previous answer, an "eligible" user cannot include firms that are not "regularly engaged in" opening bales of upland cotton for manufacturing upland cotton products in the United States or exporting upland cotton from the United States.255 The eligible domestic user criteria exclude all firms that are domestic cotton brokers or simple resellers. Nor would "eligible domestic users" include firms that have not entered into CCC contracts or who open bales but do not use them in the manufacture of upland cotton products or who only occasionally open bales of upland cotton for manufacture of upland cotton products. Similarly, the regulations for eligible "exporters" do not include persons who occasionally export and who are, thus, not considered to be persons "regularly engaged" in exporting upland cotton.256 Furthermore, the regulations do not cover exporters who have not entered into a CCC contract as exporters eligible for payment.257
102. How does Brazil respond to the United States' assertion at paragraph 129 of its first written submission, that "[t]he programme is indifferent to whether recipients of the benefit of this programme are exporters or parties that open bales for the processing of manufacturing raw cotton into cotton products in the United States." BRA
Brazil's Answer:
209. Brazil notes that the same "programme indifference" argument could have been made by the United States in the US ­ FSC (21.5) case (tax deferred whether products produced within or outside the United States) or by Canada in the Canada ­ Aircraft case (TPC payments made whether products consumed or used domestically or exported). These two Appellate Body decisions clarify that what matters is whether one segment of the programme is contingent upon export. This is consistent with the Article 3.1(a) text that the export contingency be "solely or as one of several other conditions". Step 2 export payments are clearly contingent upon proof of export of US upland cotton by eligible exporters. The fact that another class of persons in a different situation (domestic users) also may

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-72
receive the payment does not remove this export contingency. Additionally, Brazil notes that Step 2 domestic payments violate Article 3.1(b).
103. Is the Step 2 programme fund a unified fund that is available for either domestic users or exporters, without a specific amount earmarked for either domestic users or exporters? Please substantiate your response, including by reference to any applicable statutory or regulatory provisions. USA
104. How does the United States respond to the data presented in Exhibit BRA-69? Is it accurate? Please substantiate. USA
105. Why is the Step 2 programme separated into "domestic users" and "exporters"? Apart from differentiating between exporters and domestic users, with consequential differentiation as to the forms that must be filled out and certain other conditions that must be fulfilled, are the eligibility criteria for Step 2 payments identical? Are the form and rate of payment, as well as the actual payment made, identical? USA
106. With respect to paragraph 139 of the United States' first written submission, are Step 2 export payments included in the annual reduction commitments of the United States? If so, why? USA
107. Please comment on any relevance, to Brazil's de jure claims of inconsistency with the provisions of the Agreement on Agriculture, of Exhibit BRA-69, which shows Step 2 payments made to (i) domestic users and (ii) exporters. This Exhibit shows that, from FY 91/92 through 02, the Step 2 payments for exporters exceeded those for domestic users in FY 94; FY 95; FY 96 (in fact there were no domestic payments in FY 96); and FY 02. In the other years, the domestic payments are greater than export payments. BRA, USA
Brazil's Answer:
210. This document is not relevant for either Brazil's Article 3.1(a) or Article 3.1(b) claims under the SCM Agreement. Even if the Step 2 export payments were zero in certain years (which they have never been), it would not remove the export contingency. Similarly, the fact that Step 2 domestic payments were not made in one time period does not resolve their contingency upon use of domestic over imported upland cotton. Brazil's claims are that whenever a Step 2 payment for exported or domestically used upland cotton takes place, this payment is required to be made in a manner inconsistent with Articles 3.1(a) or 3.1(b) of the SCM Agreement and with Articles 3.3 and 8 of the Agreement on Agriculture in the case of Step 2 export payments.
108. At paragraph 135 of its first written submission, the United States states : "[T]he subsidy is not contingent upon export performance..." (emphasis added). Again, in the course of the first Panel meeting, the United States admitted that the Step 2 payments were "subsidies". Does the United States thus concede that Step 2 payments constitute a "subsidy" within the meaning of the WTO Agreement? USA
109. How does the United States respond to Brazil's arguments concerning a mandatory/discretionary distinction and the allegation that certain United States measures (including s.1207(a) of the 2002 FSRI Act) are mandatory? (This is referred to, for example, in paragraph 28 of Brazil's first written submission). Does the United States agree with the assertion that (subject to the availability of funds) the payment by the Secretary of Step 2 payments is mandatory under section 1207(a) FSRI upon fulfilment by a domestic user or exporter of the conditions set out in the legislation and regulations? If not, then why not? To what extent is this relevant here? What determines the "availability of funds"? Please cite any

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-73
other relevant measures or provisions which you consider should guide the Panel in respect of this issue. USA
110. Section 1207(a) of the 2002 FSRI Act provides that during the period beginning on the date of the enactment of the FSRI Act through July 31 2008, " .. the Secretary shall issue marketing certificates or cash payments, at the option of the recipient, to domestic users and exporters for documented purchases by domestic users and sales for export by exporters...". The Panel notes that Brazil does not appear to distinguish between the treatment of (i) cash payments and (ii) marketing certificates in terms of the issue of whether or not a "subsidy" exists. The United States refers to "benefits" and "payments" and "program" in asserting that Step 2 is not export contingent (paragraphs 127-135 of the United States' first written submission).
(a) Do the parties thus agree that there is no need to draw any distinction between the treatment of (i) cash payments and (ii) marketing certificates in terms of the issue of whether or not a "subsidy" exists for the purposes of the Agreement on Agriculture? BRA, USA
Brazil's Answer:
211. Brazil agrees there is no need to draw any distinction between cash payments and "commodity certificates". The Step 2 regulations indicate that Step 2 payments "shall be made available in the form of commodity certificates issued under part 1401 of this Chapter, or in cash, at the option of the programme participants".258 Part 1401 of the regulations indicated that commodity certificates may be exchanged for cash.259
(b) Why would a domestic user or an exporter select to receive a marketing certificate over a cash payment? What is the proportion of cash payments vs. marketing certificates granted under the programme? USA
111. Does the United States maintain its argument that actions based on Article 3.1(b) of the SCM Agreement are conditionally "exempt from actions" due to the operation of Article 13 of the Agreement on Agriculture? USA
112. In the event that the Panel finds that Article 6.3 of the Agreement on Agriculture does not preclude an examination of Brazil's claims under Article 3.1 of the SCM Agreement and Article III:4 of GATT 1994, how does the United States respond to the merits of Brazil's claims relating to Step 2 payments under those provisions? USA
113. Is it necessary for measures directed at agricultural processors included in AMS to discriminate on the basis of the origin of goods? USA
114. With respect to the last sentence of paragraph 22 of Brazil's closing oral statement, could Brazil elaborate on the circumstances in which a local content subsidy would comply with Article 3.1(b) of the SCM Agreement? BRA
Brazil's Answer:
212. Brazil believes the Panel is referring to paragraph 21 of the final "as delivered" version of Brazil's Closing Statement on 24 July 2003. The text of this sentence reads as follows: "There is also no conflict between Article 3.1(b) of the SCM Agreement and Agriculture Agreement Article 6 or
258 Exhibit Bra-37 (7 CFR 1427.106). 259 Exhibit Bra-34 (7 CFR 1401.4(a)).

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-74
Annex 3, paragraph 7, because there are two types of domestic subsidies ­ those that comply with Article 3.1(b) of the SCM Agreement and those that do not." Paragraph 85 of Brazil's First Oral Statement of 22 July 2003 was more precise in focusing on the relevant type of support, i.e., support provided to processors of agricultural products, stating that "[t]here are two types of `non-green box' support to processors that could benefit producers of agricultural goods: support that violates ASCM Article 3.1(b) and GATT Article III:4 and support that does not."
213. There are no circumstances in which a "local content subsidy" would comply with Article 3.1(b) of the SCM Agreement.
115. What is the meaning and relevance (if any) to Brazil's claims under Article 3 of the SCM Agreement and Article III:4 of GATT 1994 of the phrase "measures directed at agricultural processors shall be included to the extent that such measures benefit the producers of the basic agricultural products" in the Agreement on Agriculture? BRA, USA
Brazil's Answer:
214. The phrase from Annex 3, paragraph 7 of the Agriculture Agreement cited by the Panel requires Members to tabulate and include as part of AMS to individual products an amount of benefit provided to producers of basic agricultural products resulting from "measures directed at agricultural processors. . . ". The obligations of Members to comply with reduction commitments tied to AMS, and the obligations of Members under SCM Article 3 and GATT Article III, all apply cumulatively and simultaneously. This phrase recognizes that subsidies to processors of agricultural products may benefit producers of the basic agricultural product and, thus, must be included within total AMS. However, as Brazil has argued, this phrase does not provide an exemption from the SCM Agreement or GATT Article III for such subsidies, and no such exemption can be interpolated into the text.260 The cumulative nature of the obligations incurred under the WTO Agreement results in the prohibition of certain "measures directed at agricultural processors" that otherwise would be included in the AMS calculation, namely those that are contingent upon the use of domestic over imported agricultural products contrary to Article 3.1(b) of the SCM Agreement.
116. With respect to paragraph 32 of the oral statement of the EC, are subsidies contingent on the use of domestic goods consistent with the Agreement on Agriculture? Does the phrase "provide support in favour of domestic producers" in Article 3.2 of the Agreement on Agriculture refer to, and/or permit such subsidies? BRA, USA
Brazil's Answer:
215. Brazil agrees with the EC that Articles 1(a), 3.2, 6.3 of the Agreement on Agriculture include the phrase "domestic support in favour of agricultural producers". And Brazil further recognizes that all types of "domestic support in favour of agricultural producers" must be tabulated for the purposes of setting and enforcing a Member's domestic support reduction commitments (Total AMS). But Brazil notes that neither the EC nor the United States can point to any inherent conflict between these provisions and the prohibition of local content subsidies under Article 3.1(b) of the SCM Agreement for the reasons set forth in Brazil's First Oral Statement and in Brazil's answer to the Panel's Question 114.261
216. The EC and the United States fail to acknowledge that there can be subsidies/domestic support measures provided to processors of the basic agricultural product that can be consistent with Article 3.1(b) of the SCM Agreement and that also "provide support in favour of domestic producers". The EC appears to assume that all support to processors of a basic agricultural
260 First Oral Statement of Brazil, paras. 81-86. 261 First Oral Statement of Brazil, paras. 81-86.

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-75
commodity violates Article 3.1(b) of the SCM Agreement. That is simply not correct. Yet, without this assumption, there is no inherent conflict between the SCM Agreement and the Agreement on Agriculture. The absence of any conflict coupled with the absence of any explicit exemption for local content subsidies in Article 13(b) or anywhere else in the Agreement on Agriculture supports the conclusion that local content subsidies related to agricultural goods violate Article 3.1(b) of the SCM Agreement.
117. What is the relationship between Step 2 payments to exporters and the marketing loan payments, both of which appear to compensate for the price differences relative to the Liverpool A-Index? For example, is there double compensation? Or is one of the explanations that these export-related price compensatory payments are paid to different operators (namely, the producer, on the one hand under the marketing loan arrangements, and the processor/users (Step 2 programme) arrangements on the other? USA
118. Can the United States confirm that it does not rely on Article III:8 of GATT 1994? USA
G. ETI ACT
119. How does the United States respond to Brazil's reference to the panel report in India Patents (EC) (at paragraph 138 of its oral statement at the first session of the first substantive meeting)?262 How, if at all, should the Panel take this report into account in considering the issues raised by Brazil's claims relating to the ETI Act? USA
120. Concerning its claims on the ETI Act, Brazil relies on the US ­ FSC case. However, it appears that the United States did not raise the issue of the Peace Clause in that case, nor did the United States appear to invoke Article 6 of the Agreement on Agriculture. If the Panel's understanding is correct, how, if at all, are these differences relevant here? Could you direct the Panel to any relevant findings or conclusions by the panel or Appellate Body in that case? BRA
Brazil's Answer:
217. Brazil is not aware that there are any differences between the US position regarding the peace clause in the US ­ FSC case and the present case. There is no reference in the entire record of that dispute that the United States ever asserted that the EC's claims regarding the ETI Act were exempt by the peace clause. Also in this dispute, Brazil is not aware that the United States has ever asserted that Brazil's claims regarding the ETI Act were exempted by the peace clause. In this regard, the United States has taken a consistent approach in the present case and in US ­ FSC.
218. Because the United States never raised the peace clause as a defense in US ­ FSC, there were no findings by the panel or the Appellate Body regarding the peace clause. And neither the panel nor the Appellate Body held that the EC was required to demonstrate that the United States was not entitled to peace clause protection before proceeding to the substance of the EC's claims against the ETI Act. In any event, the United States has been unable to establish that the ETI Act is consistent
262 That panel stated: "It can thus be concluded that panels are not bound by previous decisions of panels or the Appellate Body even if the subject-matter is the same. In examining dispute WT/DS79 we are not legally bound by the conclusions of the Panel in dispute WT/DS50 as modified by the Appellate Body report. However, in the course of "normal dispute settlement procedures" required under Article 10.4 of the DSU, we will take into account the conclusions and reasoning in the Panel and Appellate Body reports in WT/DS50. Moreover, in our examination, we believe that we should give significant weight to both Article 3.2 of the DSU, which stresses the role of the WTO dispute settlement system in providing security and predictability to the multilateral trading system, and to the need to avoid inconsistent rulings (which concern has been referred to by both parties). In our view, these considerations form the basis of the requirement of the referral to the "original panel" wherever possible under Article 10.4 of the DSU." (footnote omitted)

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-76
with Part V of the Agreement on Agriculture. Therefore, the United States does not enjoy peace clause exemption under Article 13(c) of the Agreement on Agriculture.
121. How do you respond to the reference in paragraph 43 of EC third party oral statement with respect to the relevance of Article 17.14 of the DSU, and, in particular, the phrase "a final resolution to that dispute" (emphasis added)? Please explain the use, and relevance (if any) of the term "disputes" in Articles 9.3 and 12 and Appendix 3 of the DSU, and please cite any other provisions you consider relevant. USA, BRA
Brazil's Answer:
219. Brazil is of the view that DSU Article 17.14 requires that following the adoption of an Appellate Body report, the parties to the dispute, i.e., the defending and complaining Member, are unconditionally bound by the results of that report. This interpretation is consistent with the Appellate Body decisions in US ­ Shrimps (21.5)263 and EC ­ Bed Linen (21.5),264 both confirming that panel and Appellate Body reports adopted by the Dispute Settlement Body must be considered final resolutions to a dispute between the parties to that dispute. There is no precedent in the WTO or GATT that would require the Panel to find that the United States alone is bound in this case. It is difficult to imagine, however, how the United States could take a different position in defending against Brazil's ETI claims in this case, in light of the adoption by the DSB of the Appellate Body and panel reports in US ­ FSC (21.5), and the recommendation by the DSB that the United States bring the ETI Act into conformity with the Agreement on Agriculture and the SCM Agreement.
220. In this case, Brazil challenges exactly the same measure as that found by the panel and the Appellate Body in US ­ FSC (21.5) to violate the Agreement on Agriculture and the SCM Agreement. There have been no changes to the ETI Act since the adoption of the panel and Appellate Body reports by the WTO Dispute Settlement Body.265 Brazil challenges the ETI Act with exactly the same rationale as the EC. Thus, there is a complete identity between the "measure" and the "claims" in this case and the US ­ FSC (21.5) dispute (noting that upland cotton is a sub-set of all the products covered by the ETI Act). Under these circumstances, it is appropriate for the Panel to make similar findings of fact, conclusions of law, and recommendations as the panel and Appellate Body in US ­ FSC (21.5).266
221. Brazil does not consider any of the other provisions cited by the Panel to be relevant to this particular question. Should the Panel wish Brazil to elaborate on any of provisions more specifically, Brazil will be pleased to do so.
263 Appellate Body Report, US ­ Shrimps (21.5), para. 97. 264 Appellate Body Report, EC ­ Bed Linen (21.5), para. 90-96. 265 The United States has indicated in its First Submission (para. 189) that both branches of Congress are considering legislative proposals that would repeal the ETI Act. However, Brazil notes that it has been over 18 months since 29 January 2002, the date on which the panel and Appellate Body reports on the ETI Act were adopted by the DSB. 266 First Oral Statement of Brazil, paras. 138-39.

ANNEX I-2
ANSWERS OF THE UNITED STATES TO THE QUESTIONS FROM THE PANEL TO THE PARTIES FOLLOWING THE FIRST SESSION
OF THE FIRST SUBSTANTIVE PANEL MEETING
(11 August 2003)
UPLAND COTTON
1. Please confirm that all information and data that you have provided to the Panel relating to "cotton" in fact relates to upland cotton only. BRA, USA
1. The United States can confirm that, with the exception of export credit guarantees, all of the information and data we have provided to-date relates to upland cotton only. With respect to export credit guarantees, the Commodity Credit Corporation does not maintain data to distinguish transactions involving different types of cotton (for example, upland cotton versus extra-long staple (ELS) cotton). However, the United States has no reason to believe that types of cotton other than upland cotton constitute a material percentage of such transactions.
PRELIMINARY ISSUES
Product scope of Panel's terms of reference relating to Brazil's export credit guarantee claims
3. If the request for consultations in this dispute omitted certain products in relation to export credit guarantees, on what basis is it argued that it failed to identify the measures at issue in accordance with Article 4.4 of the DSU? USA
2. The only export credit guarantee measures identified in the Brazilian consultation request were those in respect of upland cotton. The request for consultations did not identify export credit guarantee measures for any other agricultural commodities.
3. The request for consultations identified the measures subject to consultations in a single sentence:1
The measures that are the subject of this request are prohibited and actionable subsidies provided to US producers, users and/or exporters of upland cotton1, as well as legislation, regulations, statutory instruments and amendments thereto providing such subsidies (including export credits), grants, and any other assistance to the US producers, users and exporters of upland cotton ("US upland cotton industry").
______________ 1 Except with respect to export credit guarantee programmes as explained below.
Another sentence followed this one, setting out (in a page and a half) a listing of measures that were included within the identification in the first sentence.
4. Apart from the footnote, the first two lines of the sentence quoted in the previous paragraph address "subsidies provided to US producers, users and/or exporters of upland cotton"; thus, apart
1WT/DS267/1, at 1.

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-78
from the footnote, it is clear that subsidies provided to US producers of, say, soybeans are not included within the scope of the request. Equally, apart from the footnote, it is clear that subsidies provided to, say, banks that finance US cotton exports (but do not produce, use or export cotton) are not included within the scope of the request. To give an example from another part of the request, Brazil's consultation request identified "[e]xport subsidies provided to exporters of US upland cotton under the FSC Repeal and Extraterritorial Income Exclusion Act of 2000" as a challenged measure. Having identified that measure at issue for purposes of DSU Article 4.4 as subsidies provided to upland cotton exporters under that legislation, Brazil could not then have included in its panel request such subsidies provided to exporters of all agricultural commodities or all industrial goods.
5. Brazil, however, contends that "[t]he footnote clarifies that Brazil's request with respect to export credit guarantees is not limited to upland cotton."2 Brazil's contention is incorrect. The footnote does nothing more than direct the reader of the consultation request to look "below" for an explanation. The footnote by itself does not contain any "identification of [a] measure at issue" as required by DSU Article 4.4, and therefore cannot itself bring any additional measures within the scope of the consultation request. Any such additional measures would have to be found -- if anywhere -- in an explanation "below."
6. However, as described in the first US submission, no such explanation or identification of additional measures ever appears. In fact, though Brazil devoted several paragraphs to this issue in its oral statement, it has never pointed to any explanation of any kind -- or any other identification of additional measures -- "below."
7. In addition, the statement of evidence attached to Brazil's consultation request did not include any evidence related to measures other than those for upland cotton. For Brazil to now argue that its consultation request was broader than its statement of evidence is for Brazil to admit that its consultation request was in breach of Article 7.2 of the Subsidies Agreement. Brazil cannot have it both ways.3
8. In summary, while Brazil's consultation request did identify measures at issue for purposes of DSU Article 4.4, the measures it actually identified did not include export credit guarantees for agricultural commodities other than cotton. Thus, the latter measures were not within the scope of consultations, were not consulted upon, and could not have been included in Brazil's panel request.
4. Is it argued that the export credit guarantee programmes concerning upland cotton are each a separate or independent measure, in that they operate independently? USA
9. The CCC export credit guarantee programme (GSM-102), the CCC intermediate export credit guarantee programme (GSM-103), and the Supplier Credit Guarantee Programme (SCGP) each constitute separate programmes. The distinct operation of the programmes themselves is manifested in both the terms of the particular programmes as well as in the nature of the obligation guaranteed. The GSM-102 and GSM-103 programmes guarantee obligations of banks. SCGP extends exclusively to obligations of importers. Obligations guaranteed under the GSM-102 programme may not extend beyond three years. SCGP guarantees a far lower percentage of principal (65 per cent).
10. Within each programme, allocations are made by country, by commodity, and by amount.4 Thus, discrete programming decisions are made in connection with each such country, commodity,
2Brazil's Opening Oral Statement, para. 90. 3In light of the Panel's intended finding on the scope of Brazil's consultation request with respect to export credit guarantees, the United States will be making a request for a preliminary ruling on this point. 4See 7 C.F.R. §§ 1493.4, 1493.5 (setting forth allocation criteria). These criteria also apply to SCGP. 7 C.F.R. § 1493.400.

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-79
programme, and amounts (in terms of a guarantee value).5 As a result, for the last 10 fiscal years, for example, as described in the First Written Submission of the United States, no cotton transactions occurred under the GSM-103 programme.
11. Furthermore, each export credit guarantee issued is a separate measure. Under DSU Article 4.4, it is incumbent upon Brazil to identify in its consultation request "the measures at issue." Here, Brazil identified the measure as "export credit guarantees . . . to facilitate the export of US upland cotton," and the United States may, and did, rely on that consultation request (including the attached statement of evidence) for notice.
5. Is there a specification in any legislation or regulation (or any other official government document) which limit or restrict the export credit guarantee programmes at issue exclusively to upland cotton? USA
12. Programme announcements issued pursuant to applicable programme regulations (7 C.F.R. §§ 1493.10(d), 1493.400(d)) serve to limit the availability of CCC export credit guarantees. These limitations are expressed in terms of one or more of the following criteria: commodities, total guarantee value for individual commodities, destination, and time within which export must occur. Examples of such programme announcements are included as Exhibit US-12. Thus, export credit guarantee offerings through programme announcements may be limited to cotton, pursuant to the authority of programme regulations.
6. For the purposes of the Panel's examination of Brazil's claims relating to GSM-102, GSM-103 and SCGP under the Agreement on Agriculture and the SCM Agreement, is accurate data and information available with respect to these export credit guarantee programmes concerning upland cotton alone (e.g. with respect to "long-term operating costs and losses")? In this respect, the Panel also directs the parties' attention to the specific questions below relating to the programmes. USA
13. The United States endeavoured to provide precisely such data with respect to cotton alone in paragraph 173, and associated tables, in its First Written Submission.
7. Are commitments with respect to export subsidies under the Agreement on Agriculture commodity-specific? How, if at all, is this relevant? BRA, USA
14. Export subsidy commitments under the Agriculture Agreement are, indeed, commodity specific. Each Member may have a schedule of reduction commitments with respect to specified commodities. To illustrate, the export subsidy reduction commitment schedule of the United States is attached as Exhibit US-13. As reflected in that schedule, for each of the 12 scheduled commodities, the United States has a reduction commitment with respect to both budget outlays and subsidized quantities. Other Members have similar schedules involving different commodities and reduction commitments. In all cases, however, the budgetary and quantitative commitments are unique to each commodity on each Member's respective schedule of export subsidy reduction commitments.
15. An individual Member, therefore, could apply an export subsidy programme with respect to all commodities for which it has undertaken reduction commitments. By operation of such an export subsidy programme, however, a Member may be in conformity with none, some, or all of its commodity-specific reduction commitments. So long as a Member applies such export programme in a given year in accordance with the commodity-specific reduction commitment for each year, such export subsidy programme is permitted with respect to each commodity and conforms fully with respect to Part V of the Agreement on Agriculture. The fact that commitments are taken on a product-
5See Exhibit US-12.

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-80
specific basis confirms that alleged export subsidy measures can be defined on a product-specific basis ­ and that is exactly what Brazil did here.
16. In contrast, for those specific commodities for which such Member does not have a reduction commitment, then such Member may not provide export subsidies at all in connection with such specific commodities. As a result, the same programme that, as applied, may be entirely in conformity with that Member's reduction commitment vis-à-vis one commodity may be a prohibited subsidy with respect to another commodity.
8. Does the United States confirm that the questions referred to by Brazil in paragraph 92 of Brazil's oral statement were posed to the United States in the consultations? USA
17. Yes. When Brazil posed them during the consultations, the United States immediately objected to questions about commodities other than cotton as being outside the scope of the consultations (as paragraph 94 of Brazil's oral statement acknowledges).
9. How does the United States respond to paragraph 94 of Brazil's oral statement? USA
18. It is incumbent on the complaining party to identify the specific measure at issue, and it should not fall to the responding party to intuit that measures not specified in the request for consultations are considered included by the complaining party. This deprives the responding party of an opportunity to understand the measures that are at issue and to enjoy the benefit of appropriate consultations. In the final analysis, Brazil essentially argues that its consultation questions and statement at consultations could expand the scope of the measures at issue as identified in its consultation request beyond "export credit guarantees . . . to facilitate the export of US upland cotton." This is not the case. (For further information, please refer to the US answer to Question 3.)
10. What actual prejudice, if any, has the United States suffered as a result of the alleged omission of products other than upland cotton from the request for consultations? USA
19. The issue of prejudice is not relevant to the question of whether a measure not consulted upon may be the subject of panel proceedings. The requirement of consultations at the beginning of a dispute is a central characteristic of the dispute settlement system, and is reflected throughout DSU Article 4. Consultations serve a number of important functions, including helping the parties to understand each others' concerns and aiding in efforts to resolve the dispute. The DSU affirms the importance of consultations and requires that a Member cannot proceed to a panel unless the Member has consulted on that measure.
20. Article 4.4 delimits the scope of the consultations through its requirement that the complaining Member identify the measures at issue. In light of the jurisdictional nature of the consultation requirement, Article 4.4's explicit requirement that the measures be identified serves the useful role of establishing a bright line as to the matters which are within the scope of the consultations and the dispute. Any resort to an analysis of what topics were actually discussed at the consultations ­ beyond conflicting with the DSU Article 4.6 requirement that consultations "shall be confidential," designed to facilitate the resolution of the dispute ­ would invite litigation over the unverifiable recollections of each party.
21. The United States notes that in past disputes in which the scope of the dispute was at issue, it was accepted as a given that the consultation request defined the scope of the consultations. For example, in the US ­ Import Measures dispute, the European Communities did not assert that US actions taken on 19 April 1999 were the subject of consultations even though consultations took place two days later, on 21 April 1999. Instead, accepting that its 4 March 1999, consultation request delimited the scope of the consultations, and could not have covered measures taken after that time,

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-81
the EC argued (unsuccessfully) that the April 19 actions were the same measure as that identified in the 4 March consultation request.6
22. Brazil's consultation request identified export credit guarantees on upland cotton as the sole export credit guarantee measures within the scope of the consultations and, hence, the dispute. Had it wished to include export credit guarantees with respect to other products within the scope of the consultations, Brazil could have re-filed its consultation request to include these guarantees, much as other Members have re-filed consultation requests when they have wished to expand the scope of the dispute.7 Brazil chose not to, instead apparently hoping to be relieved of the procedural requirements of the DSU, requirements enforced with respect to, and taken seriously by, other Members.8
23. While prejudice is not relevant to whether the scope of this dispute includes export credit guarantees for products other than upland cotton, the United States observes that, not only has it suffered prejudice as a result of Brazil's omission of allegations concerning products other than upland cotton, but more importantly, the United States will suffer even further prejudice if it is compelled to respond to allegations that Brazil never properly included in its request for consultations. The United States has suffered an inability to prepare, respond, and consult with respect to allegations on measures never presented to the United States in accordance with the DSU. The United States was entitled to rely on the measures identified by Brazil in its request for consultations and also rely on that which Brazil declined to put at issue by its failure to so state in its request. This justifiable reliance is furthered by Brazil's failure to amend its request for consultations after ample notice from the United States of its reasonable understanding of Brazil's request.
24. Consequently, the US has not had proper opportunity to consult with respect to the application of the three separate export credit guarantee programmes and their specific application to the myriad of commodities exported in connection with these programmes nor with respect to the conformity of the WTO obligations of the United States with the application of such programmes to such commodities. If export credit guarantees with respect to other eligible commodities were now included in this dispute, the United States will suffer the prejudice of having to prepare and defend its actions in a severely compressed time frame without the benefit of any consultations whatsoever.
11. Does the United States agree that Brazil's request for establishment of the Panel can be understood to indicate that Brazil's export credit guarantee claims relates to products other than upland cotton? How, if at all, is this relevant? USA
25. Brazil's panel request changed the language relating to export credit guarantees to include the words "other eligible agricultural commodities." However, Brazil may not unilaterally alter the scope of the "measures at issue" in its panel request simply by adding measures not previously identified. Thus, while Brazil would have been free to add additional claims in its panel request, it was not free to broaden the scope of the challenged measures.
26. Indeed, Brazil and at least one third party have argued that in two SPS disputes between the United States and Japan panels found that a complaining party may introduce new claims in its panel
6 Appellate Body report, United States - Import Measures on Certain Products of the European Communities, WT/DS165/AB/R, adopted 10 January 2001, para.70.
7 See, e.g., WT/DS204/1& WT/DS204/1/Add.1 (consultation request supplemented to add measures); WT/DS174/1 & WT/DS174/1/Add.1 (consultation request to add consultations under additional covered agreement).
8 The United States refers the Panel to the preliminary ruling of the panel in the Canada Wheat Board dispute, WT/DS276/12, which necessitated the refiling of the US panel request and establishment of a second panel. Likewise, the United States refers the panel to India's refiling of its panel request in the US Rules of Origin dispute (WT/DS243/5/Rev.1) when made aware of deficiencies in that request at the DSB meeting at which the request was considered. See also WT/DS210/2 & WT/DS210/2/Rev.1.

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-82
request that were not included in its consultation request. In both of these cases, Japan argued that the United States could not introduce new claims (cite to new legal provisions) not in its consultation request. The United States argued, and both panels agreed, that every legal claim need not be included in the consultation request. However, these disputes are not relevant here because they did not involve identifying a new measure in the panel request. As noted in the 3d party oral statement of Benin, "claims" and "measures" are distinct concepts; indeed, the distinction between "claims" and "measures" is fundamental.9
12. Please address issues and submit evidence regarding the three export credit guarantee programmes concerned relating to upland cotton and other eligible agricultural commodities in your answers to questions and rebuttal submissions. BRA, USA
27. In light of the Panel's preliminary ruling and without prejudice to the US position that these measures are not within the scope of this dispute, the United States will respond to Brazil's arguments in the US submissions.
13. Please include any argumentation and evidence to support your statement during the Panel meeting that the inclusion of such other eligible agricultural commodities would create additional "work" for the Panel with respect to each of these commodities under Article 13 of the Agreement on Agriculture. USA
28. Article 10.2 defers disciplines on, inter alia, export credit guarantees until such time as internationally agreed disciplines are reached ­ as Members hope to do in the Doha Development Round. Therefore, export credit guarantees are not export subsidies within the meaning of the Agriculture Agreement, and Article 13(c) does not apply. However, for purposes of argument, we note that Article 13(c)(ii) of the Agreement on Agriculture provides that:
(c) export subsidies that conform fully to the provisions of Part V of this Agreement, as reflected in each Member's schedule, shall be:
*****
(ii) exempt from actions based on Article XVI of GATT 1994 or Articles 3, 5, and 6 of the Subsidies Agreement.
Pursuant to Article 13(c)(ii), to the extent a Member is providing export subsidies in conformity with its reduction commitments under Part V of the Agreement on Agriculture, such export subsidies are exempt from action under Article XVI of the GATT and Articles 3, 5, and 6 of the SCM Agreement.
29. Article 13(c) is not relevant with respect to export subsidies granted in connection with commodities not subject to reduction commitments in the applicable schedule of the Member. For example, the United States does not have a reduction commitment with respect to upland cotton. Therefore, the United States may not provide any export subsidy for upland cotton. The Peace Clause protection of Article 13(c) therefore cannot apply to any theoretical export subsidy of the United States for upland cotton.
30. In contrast, however, the United States has reduction commitments for 12 commodities. (Please refer to the response of the United States to Question 7 for a description of how the export subsidy reduction commitments ­ and therefore export subsidy obligations ­ of the United States and all other members are, therefore, commodity specific.) Because such commitments are commodity specific, the extent to which Article 13(c)(ii) may apply to export subsidy measures of the United
9See, e.g., Appellate Body Report, Guatemala ­ Anti-Dumping Investigation Regarding Portland Cement from Mexico, WT/DS60/AB/R, adopted 25 November 1998, para. 72.

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-83
States is also commodity specific. Conformity with WTO obligations and the application of Article 13(c)(ii) to export credit guarantees with respect to those twelve commodities could only be evaluated by an examination of each commodity subject to reduction commitments.
Expired measures
14. Please submit evidence regarding the programmes under the 1996 FAIR Act, in particular, production flexibility contract payments and market loss assistance payments, to the extent that they would be relevant to the Panel's determination under Article 13 of the Agreement on Agriculture in your answers to questions and rebuttal submission. USA
31. The United States will present evidence and arguments regarding payments under the 1996 Act as may be relevant to the Panel's Peace Clause analysis with respect to those measures.
15. Do the parties agree that it is beyond a Panel's power to recommend a remedy for an expired measure? Could the Panel could be required to examine "expired measures" in order to conduct its assessment of the matter before it? How, if at all, is Article 7.8 of the SCM Agreement relevant to these matters? BRA, USA
32. The United States agrees that it is beyond a panel's power to recommend that a Member bring into conformity a measure that no longer exists.10 However, more fundamentally, the issue is whether the expired measures in this dispute could have been measures affecting the operation of any covered agreement within the meaning of DSU Article 4.2 or "measures at issue" within the meaning of DSU Article 6.2. Because the production flexibility contract payments and market loss assistance payments were completed, the programmes terminated, and the statutory instruments providing them superseded before Brazil's consultation and/or panel requests were filed, they could not have been "measures at issue," and they could not properly have been consulted upon or brought within the terms of reference of the Panel. This is a broader concern than whether the Panel may recommend a remedy since findings cannot be made with respect to such expired measures.
33. To determine whether past subsidies may currently be challenged, it is useful to distinguish between recurring and non-recurring subsidies. A non-recurring subsidy is a measure that continues in existence for the duration of the allocation of the subsidy to production.11 For example, a subsidy to acquire capital stock to be used in future production would be non-recurring and allocated over the useful life of the stock. Where a subsidy is non-recurring and is allocated to future production12, the measure (subsidy) may continue to be actionable even if the authorizing programme or legislation has expired. For example, in the Indonesia ­ Autos dispute, where a non-recurring subsidy was provided, the panel deemed the measure to continue even though the subsidy programme had allegedly been terminated (and it is worth noting that the termination allegedly occurred well after the panel and consultation requests­ in fact, after the second panel meeting).
34. In contrast, a recurring subsidy is typically provided year-after-year and is made in respect of current rather than future production. Once production has occurred and the measure been replaced or
10Appellate Body Report, United States ­ Import Measures on Certain Products from the European Communities, WT/DS165/AB/R, adopted 10 January 2001, para. 81.
11See, e.g., Report by the Informal Group of Experts to the Committee on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures, G/SCM/W/415, para. 12 (25 July 1997) ("Whether a subsidy is oriented towards production in future periods, consists of equity, or is carried forward in the recipient's accounts were viewed as related to the question whether its benefits persist beyond a single period, and hence whether it should be allocated to future periods.").
12Subsidies Agreement, Annex IV, para. 7 (referring to "[s]ubsidies . . . the benefits of which are allocated to future production).

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-84
superseded, there would no longer be any measure in existence to challenge. Accordingly, a Report by the Informal Group of Experts to the Committee on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures suggested that recurring subsidies ­ such as grants for purposes other than the purchase of fixed assets and price support payments ­ should be expensed, or attributed to a single year, rather than allocated over some multi-year period.13
35. In the case of production flexibility contract payments and market loss assistance payments, these measures were subsidies allocated to a particular crop or fiscal year by the respective authorizing legislation. Pursuant to the 1996 Act, the last production flexibility contract payment was made for fiscal year 2002 (1 October 2001 ­ 30 September 2002) "not later than" 30 September 2002.14 Pursuant to legislation enacted on 13 August 2001, the last market loss assistance payment was for the 2001 marketing year (1 August 2001 ­ 31 July 2002), that is, for market conditions prevailing in that year.15 Once the relevant fiscal year and marketing year, respectively, had been completed, these measures would no longer exist. Thus, by the time of Brazil's consultation and/or panel requests, there were no measures to consult upon nor to be at issue under the DSU; production flexibility contracts and market loss assistance payments therefore do not fall within the Panel's terms of reference.
Agricultural Assistance Act of 2003
16. What, if any, prejudice in terms of the presentation of its case does the United States allege, should the Panel proceed to consider the measures constituting the cottonseed payments under the Agricultural Assistance Act of 2003? USA
36. It has been a fundamental characteristic of both the GATT 1947 and the WTO dispute settlement systems that proposed measures may not be the subject of dispute settlement. This has meant that dispute settlement proceedings, including consultations, could not begin until the measure at issue actually came into existence. In seeking to bring into the scope of this dispute the Agricultural Assistance Act of 2003, Brazil is seeking to fundamentally expand and change the nature of WTO dispute settlement. This issue goes well beyond the question of whether a particular responding party is prejudiced in a particular dispute and cannot be resolved on the basis of whether such prejudice has occurred. The reasons that the United States would be prejudiced if the Panel considered any measure under the Agricultural Assistance Act of 2003, including a cottonseed payment under that Act, are the reasons that the dispute settlement system has been organized to only allow proceedings on actual, not proposed, measures. First, the responding party would have lost the benefit of consultations on these measures. Consultations serve a number of important functions, including helping the parties to understand each others' concerns and aiding in efforts to resolve the dispute. The DSU affirms the importance of consultations and requires that a Member cannot proceed to a panel unless the Member has consulted on that measure. Likewise, the DSU requires that the "measures at issue" be identified in the panel request, and non-existent measures quite simply are not measures at all.
37. Apart from reflecting the importance Members have placed on consultations, the DSU's requirement that a measure exist before it can be the subject of dispute settlement proceedings avoids a waste of resources since anticipated measures may never come into effect, or may, when enacted, be in substantially changed form. Further, allowing challenges to measures not yet in existence would

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-85
effectively authorize panels to issue advisory opinions. Should Members desire to expand the scope of the dispute settlement system in this manner, they may do so ­ indeed could only do so ­ through amendment of the DSU. The DSU now requires the existence of a measure before consultations may be requested or a panel established.
38. Finally, were the issue of the specific prejudice to the United States relevant in deciding whether a panel's terms of reference could include a measure not in existence at the time of consultations or the panel request, the United States notes that this dispute is already complex, with multiple measures at issue involving multiple claims. To require the United States to address Brazil's allegations on the Agricultural Assistance Act of 2003 would detract from the time and resources available to respond to questions and make arguments relating to those measures that are properly within the terms of reference.
17. (a) What is the relationship of the Agricultural Assistance Act of 2003 to other legislation in the request for establishment of the Panel? BRA, USA
(b) Do the legal instruments follow directly one after another, or are there temporal gaps? Are payments authorized under a broad legislative authority or are they specific to each legal instrument? BRA, USA
(c) Please provide any implementing regulations. Do these implementing regulations resemble those relating to previous programmes or payments? Are payments made retrospectively? How if at all is this relevant? BRA, USA
39. (a) The Agricultural Assistance Act of 200316 was part of a large piece of legislation covering a diverse range of topics. The Act had several disaster provisions including some relief for sugar interests and more generalized relief for persons who lost other crops. One of the provisions provided for a cottonseed payment to be applied to the 2002 cotton crop (the crop that was harvested in that calendar year):
Sec. 206. COTTONSEED. The Secretary shall use $50,000,000 of funds of the Commodity Credit Corporation to provide assistance to producers and first-handlers of the 2002 crop of cottonseed.
No law compelled or authorized the cottonseed payment for the 2002 crop except for the 2003 Act, which bears no relation to other legislation cited by Brazil.
40. There was no cottonseed payment authorized in either 2002 or 2001 for the 2001 crop. Cottonseed payments were made for the 1999 and 2000 crops. Of the three pieces of legislation authorizing cottonseed payments for the 1999 and 2000 crops, only one arguably may be found in Brazil's consultation and panel requests. Brazil identifies the "Crop Year 2001 Agricultural Economic Assistance Act (August 2001)" as a challenged measure. The Emergency Agricultural Assistance Act, Public Law No. 107-25 (13 August 2001), authorized a cottonseed payment of $85 million. In addition, Section 204(e) of Public Law No. 106-224, enacted 20 June 2000, directed the Secretary to use $100 million of Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) funds to provide assistance to producers and first handlers of the 2000 crop of cottonseed. Finally, the cottonseed payment for the 1999 crop was authorized by section 104(a) of Public Law No. 106-113, enacted 19 Nov. 1999; $79 million in residual funds were used for the 1999 crop programme.
41. (b) The temporal gaps between the various cottonseed payments are indicated in the answer to (a), above. That is, no cottonseed payments were made in 2001 or 2002 for the 2001 crop (nor
16Public Law No. 108-7 (Feb. 23, 2003).

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-86
prior to 1999). This gap serves to emphasize that these payments are ad hoc, and there was no legislative guarantee that there would be a payment for any of the years involved until the payment was actually authorized. Thus, what Brazil has termed the "cottonseed programme" is readily distinguished from those programmes under the 2002 Act that recur for each crop harvested from 2002 through 2007.17 In contrast, the legal authority for each cottonseed payment was separate and distinct; no underlying piece of legislation mandated that cottonseed payments be made.
42. (c) We note that each time a cottonseed payment is authorized, new rules must be issued to disburse the funds because there is no ongoing cottonseed "programme"; thus, when new rules are issued, the old rules are either removed at the same time or had been removed previously. That is, there is no publication that included rules for all three programmes.
43. The cottonseed payment under the 2003 Agricultural Assistance Act is not related to the other cottonseed payments except by subject matter. As indicated at the panel hearing, the text in the Agricultural Assistance Act (quoted above) is broad and simple, leaving much to the Department of Agriculture. Because of the discretion vested in the Secretary to disburse the 2002 crop cottonseed payment, and for reasons of administrative convenience, the 2003 regulations borrow from the regulations that implemented the cottonseed payments for the 2000 crop and for the 1999 crop. On 25 April 2003, the Department published regulations at 68 Federal Register 20331 to disburse funds in respect of the 2002 crop.18 The regulations to disburse the 2000 crop cottonseed payment were published at 65 Federal Register 65718 (2 November 2000).19 The regulations to disburse the 1999 crop cottonseed payment were published on 8 June 2000 at 65 Federal Register 36550.20
ARTICLE 13(B): DOMESTIC SUPPORT MEASURES
"exempt from actions"
20. In paragraph 8 of its initial brief (dated 5 June, 2003), the United States argued that the word "actions" as used in the phrase "exempt from actions" in Article 13 of the Agreement on Agriculture includes the "bringing of a case" and consultations. In paragraph 36 of its first written submission (dated 11 July, 2003), the United States stated as follows:
"[P]rior to this point in the process, the DSU rules did not afford the United States any opportunity to prevent the dispute from proceeding through consultations and panel establishment automatically, regardless of the US insistence that its measures conform to the Peace Clause."
Is it the United States' understanding that the drafters used the phrase "exempt from actions" knowing that under the DSU it would not be possible fully to exempt "actions", as the United States interprets that term? USA
44. There is a difference between a commitment to exempt from action and the mechanism to enforce that commitment, just as there is a difference between rights and obligations under the WTO and the mechanism to enforce those rights and obligations. For example, where one Member
17Farm Bills are initiated by Agricultural Committees of the US Congress and recur every 5 or 6 years. Programmes provided for in a Farm Bill are generally not tied to finite amounts of money but rather make use of the funds of the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC), which has borrowing authority in the US Treasury. See 15 US Code § 713 a-11 et seq. As a result, no appropriation is needed. By contrast, cottonseed payments (similar to other disaster payments) are ad hoc with targeted monies.
18Exhibit US-14. 19Exhibit US-15. 20Exhibit US-16.

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-87
breaches a tariff binding, another Member will need to resort to dispute settlement in order to resolve the issue. This does not mean that it is not possible to fully obligate the Member to observe its tariff bindings. The similar situation arises with respect to procedural obligations as well.
45. When responding Members have been confronted by situations in which they considered that complaining parties did not meet requirements for invoking dispute settlement procedures, those responding Members can voice their objections at consultations and the DSB meetings at which panel establishment has been considered, but then must accept that the issue will ultimately be decided by the panel. For example, notwithstanding that the DSU requires consultations on a measure before a panel may be established, there is no mechanism available to address a complaining party's failure to consult absent resolution by a panel.
46. Responding Members have allowed jurisdictional issues to go to the panel for resolution as a practical way forward that offers sufficient protection for their interests while also protecting the integrity of the dispute settlement system. This does not mean that responding Members in any way lost their rights, for example, to consult on the measures at issue before being subject to panel proceedings; it has simply been practical to allow the issue to be decided by panels.
47. Likewise, in this dispute, the fact that Brazil has attempted improperly to invoke dispute settlement procedures notwithstanding the Peace Clause ­ and the fact that the United States has accepted that the issue should be resolved by the Panel ­ does not and cannot diminish the right of the United States to be exempt from Brazil's action. The fact that Members may disregard their obligations, or act based on a misunderstanding of the facts or obligations, does not affect those obligations. In this case, Brazil considers that the Peace Clause is inapplicable. As our argumentation to date indicates, we disagree and consider that, based on a correct reading of the law and facts, the Peace Clause is applicable, and Brazil was obliged not to bring this dispute. Upon making a finding on this issue in our favour, the Panel would effectively be concluding that Brazil's invocation of dispute settlement was improper ­ even if undertaken in good faith ­ just as panels have in the past concluded that complaining parties have improperly included measures that were not consulted upon in their panel requests or claims that were not within the panel's terms of reference in their argumentation.
21. In US - FSC and US - FSC (21.5) the Appellate Body made findings under the SCM Agreement relating to export subsidies in respect of agricultural products without making a finding in respect of Article 13 of the Agreement on Agriculture. How is this relevant to the United States' interpretation of the phrase "exempt from actions" as used in Article 13? USA
48. The FSC findings are not relevant since they do not address the Peace Clause issue. The issue was not raised by either party, and so neither the panel nor the Appellate Body made any finding with respect to Article 13, nor did they offer any reasoning on this issue. Indeed, in the absence of any party raising or arguing this issue, it would be difficult to see how the panel or Appellate Body could have made any findings concerning Article 13. Those DSB recommendations and rulings thus provide no guidance for purposes of this dispute.
"such measures" and Annex 2 of the Agreement on Agriculture
22. Please explain the difference, if any, between the meaning of "defined" and the meaning of "fixed" in the phrase "a defined and fixed base period" in paragraph 6(a) of Annex 2 of the Agreement on Agriculture. BRA, USA
49. These terms should be interpreted according to the customary rules of interpretation of public international law. The ordinary meaning of "defined" is "clearly marked, definite" and "set out

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-88
precisely."21 "Fixed" means "stationary or unchanging in relative position."22 Thus, as used in paragraph 6(a), a "defined and fixed base period" means a base period that is "set out precisely" and "stationary or unchanging in relative position." That is, the "definite" base period must not be "changing in relative position"; for example, the "base period" for purposes of determining "base acres" for the deficiency payments under the 1990 Act was a farm's average acreage over the three most recent years23, and so, was not a "fixed" base period but a moving one. On the other hand, US direct payments satisfy this criterion because eligibility is determined by historical production of any of a number of crops (including upland cotton) in a base period that is "definite" (set out in the 2002 Act) and "stationary or unchanging in a relative position" (does not change in relative position for the duration of the 2002 Act).
23. Please explain the meaning of "a" in "a defined and fixed base period" in paragraph 6(a) of Annex 2 of the Agreement on Agriculture, the meaning of "the" in "the base period" in paragraphs 6(b), (c) and (d), and the difference between these and the phrase "based on the years 1986-88" in Annex 3. BRA, USA
50. Paragraph 6(a) establishes that eligibility for payments under a decoupled income support measure shall be determined by clearly-defined criteria in "a defined and fixed base period." That is, paragraph 6(a) does not mandate that any particular base period be used for a decoupled income support measure and does not mandate that the same base period be used for all decoupled income support measures. This contrasts with the use of the phrase "the base period" in paragraph 9 of Annex 3, which is defined in that same paragraph as "the years 1986 to 1988."24
51. Paragraphs 6(b), (c), and (d) use the term "the base period." As these subparagraphs all follow paragraph 6(a), in which eligibility is set in "a" defined and fixed base period, the later references to "the base period" should be read to refer to the base period used for eligibility under paragraph 6(a). Again, because paragraph 6(a) does not mandate that any particular base period be used (as opposed to paragraph 9 of Annex 3), "the base period" for paragraphs 6(b), (c), and (d) will be the "defined and fixed base period" used for purposes of eligibility under the decoupled income support measure. The definite article "the" is commonly used to refer back to a member of a indefinite set identified by the indefinite article "a." For example, it would be common grammatically to say: "A Member may take action if the Member makes the appropriate notification to the WTO."
24. How often can a Member define and fix a base period in accordance with paragraph 6 of Annex 2 of the Agreement on Agriculture? BRA, USA
52. Paragraph 6 establishes policy-specific criteria applying to a decoupled income support measure. Under paragraph 6(a), eligibility for payments under such a measure shall be determined by criteria "in a defined and fixed base period." Other policy-specific criteria under paragraph 6 establish that the amount of payments under a decoupled income support measure shall not be related to or based on the type or volume of production, the prices, or the factors of production employed in any year after the base period used for purposes of determining eligibility under paragraph 6(a).

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-89
Thus, with respect to a decoupled income support measure, the base period used must be "defined and fixed."
53. There is no requirement in paragraph 6 that a particular base period be used for a decoupled income support measure nor that the same base period be used for purposes of every decoupled income support measure. Thus, so long as the base period for a particular measure is "defined and fixed," this element of the policy-specific criteria in paragraph 6 will be met.
54. For purposes of this dispute, the base period for US direct payments under the 2002 Act is defined by the 2002 Act and fixed for the duration of the 2002 Act ­ that is, for marketing years 20022007. Thus, one "defined and fixed base period" applies for payments under the US direct payment programme for the six-year period to which the 2002 Act applies.
25. Does the United States consider that there is any ambiguity in the term "type of production" as used in paragraph 6(b) of Annex 2 of the Agreement on Agriculture? USA
55. When read according to the customary rules of interpretation of public international law, the United States does not consider that the meaning of the term "type . . . of production" as used in paragraph 6(b) is ambiguous or obscure. This paragraph establishes that the amount of decoupled income support payments may not be "based on, or linked to, the type or volume of production . . . undertaken in any year after the base period." Interpreted according to the ordinary meaning of the terms, in context, and in light of the object and purpose of the Agriculture Agreement, this provision means that a decoupled income support measure may not base or link payments to production requirements, whether by type or volume.
26. Can the United States confirm Brazil's assertions in paragraph 174 of its first written submission that the implementing regulations for direct payments prohibit or limit payments if base acreage is used for the production of certain crops? If so, can the United States clarify the statement in paragraph 56 of its first written submission that direct payments are made regardless of what is currently produced on those acres? Can the United States confirm the same point in relation to production flexibility contracts? USA
56. The 2002 Act allows any commodity or crop to be planted on base acres on a farm for which direct payments are made with limitations regarding certain commodities. Those commodities are fruits, vegetables (other than lentils, mung beans, and dry peas), and wild rice. Planting of those commodities on base acres is prohibited, except: (1) in a region with a history of double-cropping those commodities with those crops the historical production of which makes acres eligible for direct payments, double-cropping is permitted; (2) on a farm with a history of planting those commodities, planting is permitted, and direct payments would be reduced for every acre so planted; and (3) for a producer with a history of planting those commodities, planting is permitted, and direct payments would be reduced for every acre so planted.25
57. To be more precise, the third sentence of paragraph 56 of the US first submission should have used the phrase "whether upland cotton" in place of "what." As the United States has previously indicated,26 direct payments are not "related to, or based on, the type or volume" of current production
25Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002, § 1106 ("2002 Act") (Ex. US-1). 26US First Submission, para. 22 ("These [direct] payments are made with respect to farm acreage that was devoted to agricultural production in the past; the payments, however, are made regardless of whether upland cotton is currently produced on those acres or whether anything is produced at all."); id., para. 24 ("As stated, no current production of upland cotton (or any other crop) is required to receive payment ­ or, put another way, the payment is the same regardless of how much, or any, upland cotton is produced."); id., para. 67 ("Not only is there no requirement that a direct payment recipient engage in any particular type or volume of

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-90
because there is no requirement that a recipient produce upland cotton or any other crop in order to receive these payments. Direct payments are made with respect to farm acreage that was devoted to agricultural production in the past. In its rebuttal submission, the United States will describe production flexibility contract payments, which would share these characteristics but not others with direct payments, and explain why production flexibility contract payments are "green box" measures.
29. Please explain the meaning of the words "the fundamental requirement" as used in paragraph 1 of Annex 2 of the Agreement on Agriculture. USA
58. "Fundamental" means "[s]erving as the base or foundation" and "primary, original; from which others are derived."27 A "requirement" is "[s]omething called for or demanded."28 Thus, the "fundamental requirement" that measures for which exemption from reduction commitments under Article 6 is claimed must have "no, or at most minimal, trade-distorting effects or effects on production" is "something called for or demanded" "from which others are derived."
59. The United States, perhaps in distinction from the European Communities, does not view this "requirement" ("something called for or demanded") as merely setting out in hortatory terms the objective of Annex 2. However, as suggested by the use of the word "fundamental" ("from which others are derived") and the structure of Annex 2 (that is, beginning the second sentence with the word "accordingly"), compliance with the fundamental requirement of the first sentence will be demonstrated by conforming to the basic criteria of the second sentence plus the applicable policyspecific criteria of paragraph 6 through 13. Relevant context supports this interpretation: Articles 6.1, 7.1, and 7.2 refer to measures which are not subject to reduction commitments because they qualify under "the criteria set out in Annex 2." Article 18.3 requires a Member to notify "details of the new or modified measure and its conformity with the agreed criteria as set out either in Article 6 or in Annex 2." Annex 2 itself, in describing the policy-specific criteria that must be met under paragraphs 2 and 5, emphasizes that measures must meet the "basic criteria set out in paragraph 1" rather than the "fundamental requirement" of that paragraph.
60. The text and context of paragraph 1 is also confirmed by the object and purpose of the Agriculture Agreement. Members need to be able to design green box measures with certainty that these measures will be exempt from reduction commitments so that they can meet their binding commitments on domestic support in furtherance of the goal of "substantial progressive reductions in agricultural support . . . sustained over an agreed period of time."29 Assessing the conformity of a claimed green box measure against the "fundamental requirement" of the first sentence in isolation would be a difficult, if not impossible task, for a Panel. Members foresaw the problem and therefore provided guidance on how a measure would fulfill that fundamental requirement ­ that is, if the measures "conform to the . . . basic criteria" of the second sentence plus any applicable policyspecific criteria, they shall be deemed to have met the fundamental requirement of the first sentence of Annex 2.
30. Do the parties consider that direct payments and production flexibility contract payments meet or met the basic criteria referred to in paragraph 1 of Annex 2 of the Agreement on Agriculture? BRA, USA
61. The "basic criteria" referred to in paragraph 1 of Annex 2 are: (a) the support in question shall be provided through a publicly-funded government programme (including government revenue

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-91
foregone) not involving transfers from consumers and (b) the support in question shall not have the effect of providing price support to producers. Direct payments under the 2002 Act meet these basic criteria, and the expired production flexibility contract payments under the 1996 Act met these criteria as well.
62. As noted in the US first written submission, direct payments under the 2002 Act are support provided through a publicly-funded government programme not involving transfers from consumers. Under Section 1103 of the 2002 Act, the Secretary of Agriculture "shall make direct payments to producers on farms [including landowners where no production occurs] for which payment yields and base acres are established," and, under Section 1601 of the Act, the Secretary "shall use the funds, facilities, and authorities of the Commodity Credit Corporation to carry out this title." Thus, no transfers from consumers are involved.30
63. Direct payments under the 2002 Act also do not have the effect of providing price support to producers. Direct payments augment the income of persons on farms based on historic acres and yields. They are not made to support any "applied administered price" for upland cotton (or that for any other commodity), for example, by increasing upland cotton demand or reducing upland cotton supply.31 To-date, Brazil has not contested that US direct payments satisfy both "basic criteria" under paragraph 1.
64. As set out in the US answer to Question 15 from the Panel, the expired production flexibility contract payments are not within the Panel's terms of reference. Nonetheless, as we shall explain in more detail in our rebuttal submission, these payments too satisfy the "basic criteria" referred to in paragraph 1 of Annex 2. Production flexibility contract payments provide support through a publiclyfunded government programme not involving transfers from consumers.32 In addition, production flexibility contract payments did not have the effect of providing price support to producers; these payments augmented the income of persons on farms based on historic acres and yields but were not made to support any "applied administered price" for upland cotton (or that for any other commodity). Again, Brazil has not contested that US production flexibility contract payments satisfy both "basic criteria" under paragraph 1.
31. If the first sentence of paragraph 1 of Annex 2 is not a stand-alone obligation, then must new, non- or minimally trade-distorting measures that do not conform to the criteria listed in Annex 2 be classified as non-Green Box? BRA, USA
65. As set out in the US answer to Question 29 from the Panel, the United States views the first sentence of paragraph 1 as an obligation in that it establishes a "fundamental requirement" for green box measures under Annex 2. This obligation is met when measures conform to the basic criteria of the second sentence plus the applicable policy-specific criteria of paragraphs 6 through 13. If a new measure does not conform to the basic and applicable policy-specific criteria in Annex 2, it will not have the benefit of the presumption that it meets the fundamental requirement of the first sentence.
32. If the first sentence of paragraph 1 of Annex 2 expresses a general principle which informs the interpretation of the criteria in Annex 2, please explain how this affects the assessment of the direct payments programme's compliance with paragraph 6 of Annex 2. USA

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-92
66. As set out in the US answer to Question 29 from the Panel, the United States does not view the first sentence of paragraph 1 as merely setting out a general principle; according to its term, it establishes a "fundamental requirement" for green box measures under Annex 2. However, Annex 2 also indicates that measures that conform to the basic criteria of the second sentence plus the applicable policy-specific criteria of paragraphs 6 through 13 comply with that fundamental requirement. Thus, the first sentence of paragraph 1 provides important context for the interpretation of other provisions of Annex 2.
67. US direct payments satisfy the criteria set out in Annex 2 and therefore comply with the fundamental requirement of the first sentence of paragraph 1. As explained in the US answer to Question 30, US direct payments satisfy the two basic criteria under the second sentence of paragraph 1. In addition, as set out in the US first written submission,33 direct payments satisfy the five policyspecific criteria set out in paragraph 6 of Annex 2 for decoupled income support.
68. The context provided by the first sentence of paragraph 1 indicates that Brazil's argument that direct payments do not satisfy paragraph 6(b) because payments are eliminated or reduced if payment recipients harvest certain fruits or vegetables is wrong.34 Brazil's argument essentially is that paragraph 6(b) precludes a Member from requiring a recipient not to produce certain crops, rather than precluding a Member from requiring a recipient to produce certain crops. As indicated above, however, Brazil's interpretation leads to a conflict between paragraph 6(b) and the fundamental requirement of the first sentence. That is, a measure that demonstrably meets that fundamental requirement (there are no trade-distorting effects or effects on production because production of no crop is allowed) would be inconsistent with paragraph 6(b) (the amount of payment would be based on the type of production ­ production of no crops ­ in a year after the base period). In the context of the first sentence of paragraph 1, then, paragraph 6(b) should be read to prevent a Member from requiring a recipient to produce certain crops. US direct payments do not require a recipient to produce upland cotton or any other crop in order to receive payment.
"do not grant support to a specific commodity"
33. According to the United States' interpretation of the word "grant", when can a Member claim that a measure is not exempt from action under Article 13(b)? What if the measure is enacted annually? Can the Member obtain a remedy in respect of that measure under the DSU? USA
69. The United States has interpreted the word "grant" according to its ordinary meaning: to "bestow as a favour" or "give or confer (a possession, a right, etc.) formally."35 Because the phrase "such measures do not grant support to a specific commodity" is expressed in the present tense, we have explained that this criterion indicates that whether measures currently in effect are exempt from actions depends upon the support they currently grant.36 For example, whether payments under the 2002 Act can be challenged in the WTO at this time requires an examination of the product-specific support such measures currently grant (understood to be as of the date of the panel request or panel establishment), not the support measures granted 1, 2, or 3 years ago. A finding of a Peace Clause breach by current measures would allow a Member to proceed with an action based on Peace Clausespecified provisions and potentially obtain remedies with respect to those current subsidies.
70. A Member can make the claim that a measure is not exempt from action under Article 13(b) when the Member believes the measures at issue fail to conform to the Peace Clause, including that the Member believes the measure provides support in excess of that decided in 1992. It would not
33US First Written Submission, para. 67. 34See also US Answer to Question 25 from the Panel. 35The New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary, vol. 1, at 1131 (fourth & fifth definitions). 36US First Written Submission, paras. 79-81.

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-93
matter whether the measure were enacted annually. If there were a finding of a breach of the Peace Clause, then the complaining party could obtain a remedy in the form of a recommendation to bring the measure into conformity with the WTO agreements.
71. The issue of when a Member can claim that a measure is not exempt from action highlights the difficulty in adopting Brazil's interpretation that only budgetary outlays are relevant to the Peace Clause comparison. In the case of US domestic support measures, budgetary outlays are not known ahead of time. Accordingly, Brazil could only provide estimates of marketing year 2002 budgetary outlays in its first submission, explaining that "the evidence to tabulate the support granted to upland cotton during MY 2002 is not yet complete as the marketing year does not end until 31 July 2003."37 Brazil has not demonstrated that US product-specific budgetary outlays for upland cotton exceeded marketing year 1992 outlays as of the time of its panel request, as of the time of panel establishment, nor, indeed, as of today.38
72. This problem is not presented when one looks at the support as decided by US domestic support measures. Because those measures, both in 1992 and today, set a rate of support (72.9 cents per pound during marketing year 1992; 52 cents per pound during marketing year 2002), the level of support is known at the outset (or even in advance) of the relevant crop year in which payments are made, permitting a rapid challenge and perhaps panel findings before a given crop year is over. Thus, a Member would be able to claim that a current measure is not exempt from action under Article 13(b) and would be able to obtain a remedy under the DSU.
35. Does a failure by a Member to comply in a given year with either the chapeau of Article 13(b) or the proviso in subparagraph (ii) of Article 13(b) impact its entitlement to benefit in an earlier or a later year from the exemption from action provided by Article 13(b)? BRA, USA
73. A failure by a Member to comply in a given year with either the chapeau of Article 13(b) or the proviso in subparagraph (ii) of Article 13(b) would only lift the exemption from action for those measures for the year of that breach. Measures (subsidies) in a later year would remain exempt from action so long as those measures in the given year comply with the conditions in Article 13(b)(ii).
74. This conclusion flows from the text of the Peace Clause as well as the nature of the subsidies challenged by Brazil. The universe of measures exempt from actions under Article 13(b)(ii) is "domestic support measures that conform fully to the provisions of Article 6 of this Agreement including direct payments that conform to the requirements of paragraph 5 thereof, as reflected in each Member's Schedule, as well as domestic support within de minimis levels and in conformity with paragraph 2 of Article 6." Because the fundamental commitment under Article 6 is to limit domestic support as measured by the Current Total Aggregate Measurement of Support to a Member's final bound commitment level, and that commitment is judged on a year-by-year basis39, a Member may breach its commitments under Article 6 in one year and come back into compliance in the following year. Thus, conformity with this element of Article 13 must be judged on a year-by-year basis.
75. The proviso to Article 13 states that such measures shall be exempt from actions "provided that such measures do not grant support to a specific commodity in excess of that decided during the 1992 marketing year." Thus, with respect to past subsidies (and putting aside the issue of whether there is a measure that can be challenged under the DSU), the Peace Clause proviso would require an
37Brazil's First Written Submission, para. 149. 38See US Answer to Question 67 from the Panel. 39Agriculture Agreement, Article 6.3 ("A Member shall be considered to be in compliance with its domestic support reduction commitments in any year in which its domestic support in favour of agricultural producers expressed in terms of Current Total AMS does not exceed the corresponding annual or final bound commitment level specified in Part IV of the Member's Schedule.") (emphasis added).

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-94
examination of the support those measures were granting as of the time such measures were in existence. Were the Peace Clause breached in any particular year, a Member could bring an action against such measure (subsidy), but only for the year of the breach. For example, where subsidies were provided on a yearly basis, a Member could breach the Peace Clause in one year in which the support such measures grant is in excess of that decided during the 1992 marketing year but could be in conformity in the following year if support were again within the 1992 marketing year level. Only the subsidies for the year in which the Peace Clause were breached would not be exempt from actions.
76. Finally, we note that payments under the 2002 Act are recurring subsidies, expensed in the crop year to which they apply and superseded by new payments in the following crop year.40 (So too were past payments under the expired 1996 Act.) Thus, whether such measures conform fully to Article 6 and do not grant support in excess of that decided during the 1992 marketing year ­ that is, whether such measures are exempt from action under Article 13(b) ­ must be judged on a year-byyear basis. A breach of the Peace Clause in any particular year would allow a Member to bring an action against such measures, but only for the year of the breach.
36. Does a failure by a Member to comply with Article 13(b) in respect of a specific commodity impact its entitlement to benefit in respect of other agricultural products from the exemption from action provided by Article 13(b)? BRA, USA
77. No. For example, were the Panel to find a breach of the Peace Clause because the productspecific support US measures grant for upland cotton is in excess of that decided during the 1992 marketing year, this would not remove Peace Clause protection for support for soybeans (or any other commodity). In any subsequent action, a complaining Member would have to demonstrate that the challenged measures breach the Peace Clause with respect to that commodity and support.
37. In the United States' view, why did the drafters not use the exact term "product-specific" in Article 13(b)(ii)? USA
78. It is not possible to determine exactly why the drafters of Article 13(b)(ii) did not use the term "product-specific support" in place of "support to a specific commodity." Nonetheless, the phrase "support to a specific commodity" must be interpreted according to its ordinary meaning, in context, and in light of the object and purpose of the Agreement. As the United States has explained, this phrase means "product-specific support."41 We note that while it is no doubt a good drafting rule to use one and only one term for any given concept in an agreement, the drafters' failure to follow that rule does not alter a treaty interpreter's obligation to interpret under the customary rules of public international law the words that actually are in the treaty.
79. Further, it is not surprising that this exact phrase is not used in the Peace Clause. The phrase "product-specific support" is not a defined term to be found in Agriculture Agreement Article 1. Not surprisingly, then, in different provisions the Agriculture Agreement uses different words to describe the concept of product-specific support. For example, in Article 1(a), the basic definition of product-specific support (although not identified as such) is given as "support . . . provided for an agricultural product in favour of the producers of the basic agricultural product." In Article 1(h), the Agreement again refers to product-specific support not by using that term but by using the words "support for basic agricultural products."42 None of these references to "product-specific support" even uses the term "specific" whereas the phrase "support to a specific commodity" contains all three elements of that phrase (that is, product, specific, and support), using "commodity" in place of
40See US Answer to Question 15 from the Panel. 41US First Written Submission, paras. 77-78. 42Similarly, in Annex 3, paragraph 6, the Agreement refers to a "product-specific" AMS not by using those words but by using the phrase "for each basic agricultural product, a specific AMS shall be established."

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-95
"support."43 The use of the phrase "support to a specific commodity" in the Peace Clause to refer to "product-specific support" is not remarkable in light of these multiple examples of different words in the Agreement that describe the same concept.44
38. Given the fact that subsidies available for more than one product could have various effects on production, how does the United States demarcate between product-specific support and non-product specific support ? USA
80. The phrase "support to a specific commodity" in the Peace Clause proviso, read according to its ordinary meaning, in context, and in light of the object and purpose of the Agreement, means "product-specific support." The United States finds the demarcation between product-specific and non-product-specific support in the Agriculture Agreement. Specifically, Article 1(a) defines the universe of support making up the Aggregate Measurement of Support as follows:
"Aggregate Measurement of Support" and "AMS" mean the annual level of support, expressed in monetary terms, provided for an agricultural product in favour of the producers of the basic agricultural product or non-product-specific support provided in favour of agricultural producers in general, other than support provided under programmes that qualify as exempt from reduction under Annex 2 to this Agreement . . . (italics added).
Article 1(h), which defines the "Total Aggregate Measurement of Support,"45 and paragraph 1 of Annex 3, explaining the calculation of the Aggregate Measurement of Support46, also distinguish between product-specific and non-product-specific support, without providing additional detail to that found in Article 1(a).
81. Article 1(a), therefore, provides the basic demarcation between product-specific and nonproduct-specific support; as mentioned at the first panel meeting, Brazil has not contested this point. Product-specific support, then, is "support . . . provided for an agricultural product in favour of the producers of the basic agricultural product." This definition contains two elements. First, the support must be provided "for an agricultural product," which suggests that the subsidy is given "in favour of"47 a product and not in respect of criteria not related to the product or in respect of multiple products. Second, such support is "in favour of the producers of the basic agricultural product,"
43Again, the use of the term "commodity" in place of "product" may result from the unique negotiating history of the Peace Clause. While the term "product" is used exclusively elsewhere in the Agreement, in the course of the Uruguay Round agriculture negotiations, the term "commodity" had been commonly used. See, e.g., Framework Agreement on Agriculture Reform Programme, Draft Text by the Chairman, MTN.GNG/NG5/W/170, paras. 3, 5, 6, Annex I (11 July 1990). Despite the fact that the Peace Clause uses "commodity" in place of "product," Brazil has not suggested that "commodity" should be interpreted as anything other than agricultural "products" subject to the Agreement.
44The United States also notes that under paragraph 1 of Annex 3, non-product-specific support is to be aggregated into one separate AMS, which supports the notion that non-product-specific support is not to be allocated to specific products, contrary to what Brazil urges the Panel to do here.
45Agriculture Agreement, Article 1(h) ("`Total Aggregate Measurement of Support' and `Total AMS' mean the sum of all domestic support provided in favour of agricultural producers, calculated as the sum of all aggregate measurements of support for basic agricultural products, all non-product-specific aggregate measurements of support and all equivalent measurements of support for agricultural products . . . .").
46Agriculture Agreement, Annex 3, paragraph 1 ("Subject to the provisions of Article 6, an Aggregate Measurement of Support (AMS) shall be calculated on a product-specific basis for each basic agricultural product receiving market price support, non-exempt direct payments, or any other subsidy not exempted from the reduction commitment (`other non-exempt policies'). Support which is non-product specific shall be totalled into one non-product-specific AMS in total monetary terms." (emphasis added)).

which suggests that subsidy benefits those who produce the product ­ that is, production is necessary for the support to be received.
82. Article 1(a) explains non-product-specific support as "support provided in favour of agricultural producers in general." That is, non-product-specific support is not support provided "for an agricultural product" and is not support in favour of "the producers of the basic agricultural product" but rather is support in favour of agricultural producers "generally."48 Thus, read according to its ordinary meaning and in the context of Article 1(a), non-product-specific support is a residual category of support covering those measures that do not fall within the more detailed criteria set out in the definition of product-specific support.
83. Finally, we note Brazil's argument that "[t]he term `product-specific' that the United States seeks to read into Article 13(b)(ii) has a very technical and particular meaning as set out in Article 6(4), and Annex 3 to the Agreement on Agriculture."49 As explained above, while both of these provisions use the term "product-specific" as well as "non-product-specific," the Panel will search these provisions in vain for a "technical and particular meaning" of either of these terms. Brazil fails to direct the Panel's attention to the only explanation of the meaning of those terms, Article 1(a), perhaps because this explanation of the "technical and particular meaning" of product-specific support suggests that several of the measures challenged by Brazil provide non-product-specific support and are not part of the comparison under the Peace Clause proviso.
39. If "such measures" in Article 13(b)(ii) refers to all those in the chapeau of Article 13(b), why are they not all included in the potential comparisons with 1992? In what circumstances can measures which grant non-product specific support lose exemption from action under Articles 5 and 6 of the SCM Agreement and Article XVI of GATT 1994? USA
84. The introductory phrase of Article 13(b) establishes the full universe of measures that are potentially exempt from actions under this provision ­ that is, domestic support measures "that conform fully to the provisions of Article 6." The phrase "such measures" in Article 13(b)(ii) occurs in the proviso, and the use of the word "such" refers back to those measures identified in the introductory phrase. However, the type of support that must be compared pursuant to the proviso is set out by the text of the proviso: the comparison is not between the total (product-specific and nonproduct-specific) support provided by all measures that existed in 1992 versus those that exist currently; rather, the proviso comparison is between the "support to a specific commodity" that challenged measures grant versus that decided during the 1992 marketing year.
85. With respect to Article 13(b), then, the Peace Clause has two tiers of analysis and effect. First, non-green box domestic support measures collectively lose Peace Clause protection if they do not conform fully to the provision of Article 6 ­ that is, if they exceed a Member's domestic support commitment level. Second, even if a Member's Current Total Aggregate Measurement of Support is within the reduction commitment, the support to a specific commodity can still lose its Peace Clause protection if it exceeds the level decided during marketing year 1992. This second tier was intended to prevent a Member from increasing its non-green box support to a specific commodity while staying within the domestic support commitment level. When a Member has disciplined its product-specific support, however, by staying within the level decided during the 1992 marketing year (as the United States has done), it is entitled to the benefit of observing that commitment.
86. Finally, we note that Brazil's interpretation of the proviso calls for allocating support from all non-green box measures to an agricultural product regardless of whether that support is product-

specific or non-product-specific. This analysis has no foundation in the Agriculture Agreement. In fact, Brazil has not followed its own approach through to its logical conclusion: as alluded to by Question 41 from the Panel, presumably Brazil could have taken all non-product-specific support provided by the United States and allocated some portion of that support to upland cotton producers. Brazil has not done so, but there is no basis in the Agreement to distinguish the non-product-specific support Brazil excluded from the non-product-specific support Brazil included for purposes of its Peace Clause analysis (for example, counter-cyclical payments and crop insurance). The only basis to distinguish whether a measure provides "support to a specific commodity" that is found in the Agriculture Agreement is to rely on the distinction between product-specific and non-product-specific support as explained in Article 1(a).
43. What are the precise differences between deficiency payments and counter-cyclical payments that lead you to classify the former as product-specific and the latter as non-product specific? How do you classify market loss assistance payments? USA
87. As indicated in the US answer to Question 38 from the Panel, Article 1(a) of the Agriculture Agreement provides the demarcation between product-specific and non-product-specific support. The definition of product-specific support contains two elements. First, the support must be provided "for an agricultural product," which suggests that the subsidy is given in respect of a product and not in respect of criteria not related to the product or in respect of multiple products. Second, such support is "in favour of the producers of the basic agricultural product," which suggests that subsidy recipients are those who produce the product ­ that is, production is necessary for the support to be received. Non-product-specific support is a residual category of "support provided in favour of agricultural producers in general" ­ that is, "generally."
88. In light of these definitions, it follows that deficiency payments under the 1990 Act were product-specific support whereas counter-cyclical payments are non-product-specific. The relevant differences may be summarized as follows:

Deficiency Payments

Counter-Cyclical Payments

Farmer must plant upland cotton to receive payment No requirement to plant upland cotton (or any crop)

Payment based on acres "planted for harvest" to Payment based on historical "base acres" irrespective

upland cotton in that crop year

of acres currently planted to upland cotton

In short, deficiency payments required production of upland cotton whereas counter-cyclical payments do not. Thus, deficiency payments were support for upland cotton in favour of the producers of upland cotton.
89. In order to receive a deficiency payment, a producer was required to plant upland cotton for harvest. The "farm programme payment acreage" for an individual farm ­ that is, the acres on the farm for which the producer would receive a deficiency payment in a given crop year ­ was defined as "the smaller of the maximum payment acreage or the acreage planted to the crop on the farm for harvest within the permitted acreage of the crop of the farm."50 That is, a farmer would be paid on the acres planted to upland cotton for harvest up to the maximum payment acreage. Under the programme regulations, "crop acreage planted for harvest" was generally defined as "[t]he acreage

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-98
harvested."51 Thus, in a given crop year, production was required to receive a deficiency payment, and the amount of the deficiency payment was based on the acreage on which upland cotton was harvested. Thus, both elements of the definition of product-specific support in Article 1(a) are satisfied. The deficiency payment was support for an agricultural product in favour of the producers of the product because recipients had to have planted upland cotton for harvest to receive payment in a given crop year.
90. On the other hand, counter-cyclical payments are decoupled from production requirements. Counter-cyclical payments are made to persons with farm acres that were devoted to production of any of a number of crops, including upland cotton, during an historical base period. That base period was defined in the 2002 Act and is fixed for the life of the legislation (that is, for marketing years 2002-2007).52 However, a person with "upland cotton base acres" need not produce upland cotton (nor any other particular crop) to receive the counter-cyclical payment. A person with "upland cotton base acres" also need not produce any crop at all. Thus, counter-cyclical payments do not satisfy the definition of product-specific support: they are not payments for an agricultural product in favour of the producers of the product since no production of any product, including upland cotton, need occur for payment.
91. As indicated in our 1999 WTO domestic support notification (G/AG/N/USA/43), the United States believes that market loss assistance payments are non-product-specific amber box support. As with production flexibility contract payments, market loss assistance payments were made to persons with farm acres that previously had been devoted to production of certain crops, including upland cotton, during an historical base period. No production of upland cotton or of any other crop was required to receive payment, and no production was required at all. Thus, these payments do not meet the definition of product-specific support in Annex 1(a).
92. However, the United States did notify these payments as amber box because they were made in response to low prevailing commodity prices. As such, the United States does not consider that they conform to the criterion in paragraph 6(c) of Annex 2 that the amount of decoupled income support payments "in any given year shall not be related to, or based on, the prices, domestic or international, applying to any production undertaken in any year after the base period". We note that while Brazil has included market loss assistance payments in its Peace Clause comparison, it has not contested the US position (as evidenced by G/AG/N/USA/43) that these payments are non-productspecific amber box support.53
45. If the Panel considered that Step 2 payments paid to exporters were an export subsidy, would the United States count them as domestic support measures for the purposes of Article 13(b)? Please verify Brazil's separate data for Step 2 export payments and Step 2 domestic payments in Exhibit BRA-69 or provide separate data. BRA, USA
517 Code of Federal Regulations § 1413.4(b) (1 Jan. 1993) (Exhibit US-3). Under the 1990 Act, there were so-called 50-92 provisions, under which a producer could devote part of the maximum payment acreage (that is, 85 per cent of the established crop acreage base less any acreage under an acreage reduction programme) to conserving uses and still receive deficiency payments on the acreage. To take advantage of that provision, the producer was still required to plant upland cotton for harvest on at least 50 per cent of the maximum payment acreage. 7 US Code § 1444-2(c)(1)(D)(ii) (1992 Supp.) (4 Jan. 1993) ("To be eligible for payments . . . the producers on a farm must actually plant upland cotton for harvest on at least 50 per cent of the maximum payment acres for cotton for the farm.") (Exhibit US-5).
52By way of contrast, under the deficiency payment program, "base acres" were determined by a farmer's yearly upland cotton planting decisions. Base acres were defined as "the average of the acreages planted and considered planted to such crop for harvest on the farm in each of the 3 crop years preceding such crop year." 7 Code of Federal Regulations § 1413.7(c) (1 Jan. 1993) (Exhibit US-3).

93. If the Panel were to conclude that the Step 2 programme and payments made thereunder could be separated in to domestic and export components, and the export component were deemed to be an export subsidy, logically, that component would no longer constitute domestic support. Therefore, that measure would not form part of an analysis under Article 13(b), but rather would fall under Article 13(c). For data relating to Step 2 payment by fiscal year and use, please see the US answer to Question 104 from the Panel.
46. What is the relevance, if any, of the concept of "specificity" in Article 2 of the SCM Agreement and references to "a product" or "subsidized product" in certain provisions of the SCM Agreement to the meaning of "support to a specific commodity" in Article 13(b)(ii) Agreement on Agriculture? BRA, USA
94. The concept of specificity in Article 2 of the Subsidies Agreement is entirely unrelated to the meaning of "support to a specific commodity" in Article 13(b)(ii) of the Agreement on Agriculture. Generally, under Article 2 of the Subsidies Agreement, a subsidy is specific if it is limited, in law or in fact, to "an enterprise or industry or group of enterprises or industries." The relevant context for "support to a specific commodity" is found in Articles 1(a), 1(h), 6.4, and Annex 3 of the Agriculture Agreement.
"in excess of that decided during the 1992 marketing year"
47. Where does Article 13(b)(ii) require a year-on-year comparison? BRA, USA
95. Please see the US answer to Question 35 from the Panel for a reply to this question.
48. Does Article 13(b)(ii) require a comparison of support granted with support decided? How could such a comparison be made? BRA, USA
96. The proviso to Article 13(b)(ii) requires a comparison of the product-specific support that challenged measures grant (in this case, for upland cotton) to the product-specific support decided during the 1992 marketing year. The United States agrees with Brazil that the Peace Clause proviso requires an apples-to-apples comparison. However, while Brazil's proposed comparison (the budgetary outlays that may be allocated to a commodity, whether product-specific or non-productspecific) has no grounding in the text or context of the Peace Clause, the United States believes the basis for this comparison is established by the use of the word "decided."
97. The term "decided" is not explicitly defined in the Agreement and is not used elsewhere in the Agriculture Agreement nor in the Subsidies Agreement to refer to support or subsidies. Members' unique choice of words must be given meaning. "Decide" means to "[d]etermine on as a settlement, pronounce in judgement" and "[c]ome to a determination or resolution that, to do, whether."54 Thus, the basis for the comparison under the Peace Clause proviso is the product-specific support that was "determined" or "pronounced" during the 1992 marketing year. US measures "decided" productspecific support for upland cotton in terms of a rate of 72.9 cents per pound through the combination of marketing loans and deficiency payments. Thus, to make an apples-to-apples comparison, this rate of support must be compared to the rate of support that challenged measures "grant."
98. Contrary to Brazil's assertion, the use of the term "grant" does not compel an examination of budgetary outlays. The ordinary meaning of "grant" is to "bestow as a favour" or "give or confer (a possession, a right, etc.) formally".55 Thus, the use of the term "grant" would permit an evaluation of the rate of support that challenged measures "give or confer . . . formally". Brazil's reference to

footnote 55 of the Subsidies Agreement56 is not pertinent as this is one of several Subsidies Agreement references to a Member granting a subsidy,57 which differs from the Peace Clause phrase, "such measures do not grant support". More importantly, Members did not choose to use the word "granted" in place of "decided", and a valid interpretation must make sense of that choice rather than reading it out of the Agreement. In addition, had Members intended the Peace Clause comparison to be made solely on the basis of budgetary outlays, they could have used that term. After all, "budgetary outlays" is a defined term in Article 1(c) and repeatedly referred to in the Agreement.58
99. Thus, the comparison of the product-specific support "decided" during the 1992 marketing year to the support challenged measures "grant" must be made on the terms established by US measures themselves. The United States decided to ensure producer support at a rate of 72.9 cents per pound of upland cotton during the 1992 marketing year. In this case, the comparison presents no difficulty because the challenged measures also grant a rate of support (52 cents per pound). Because the latter is not in excess of the former, challenged US domestic support measures are exempt from actions pursuant to Article 13(b)(ii).
50. Please provide any written drafting history which could shed light on why the proviso was added to what is now Article 13(b)(ii) and, in particular, why both words "grant" and "decided" were used. USA
100. The United States is not aware of any written drafting history on this point.
51. Could the United States please comment on the interpretation advanced by the EC, in paragraphs 16 and 18 of its oral statement, of the words "decided during the 1992 marketing year"? USA
101. The United States agrees with parts of the interpretation advanced by the EC. The Communities too see the use of the term "decided" in the Peace Clause as notable and suggest that it compels an examination of "an amount of support adopted by some form of decision". The Communities argues that a Member cannot be deemed to have "decided" all of the "applications for support under a particular programme" (as is implied by an examination of budgetary outlays) and that the term "decided" cannot "set up a comparison between domestic support [actually] granted in 1992 and domestic support granted in a more recent period". The United States agrees with these statements.
102. The Communities also advance argumentation that may not flow from the ordinary meaning of the term "decided." For example, the Communities suggests that the term "implies a one-off decision", without further explanation. It would appear that the support "decided" during a marketing

year could be made through more than one decision, however. In addition, the Communities suggests that this decision is one "in which support for a specific product is decided and allocated for future years." While it may be that a Member decided support for a future year during the 1992 marketing year, forming the benchmark for the comparison under the Peace Clause proviso, it would also appear likely that a Member decided on a level of support for the marketing year during that marketing year. Thus, the support decided during the 1992 marketing year would not appear to be necessarily limited to support for future years.
52. Please comment on an interpretation of the words "decided during" in Article 13(b)(ii) that would read them as synonymous with the words "authorized during". BRA, USA
103. The ordinary meaning of the words "decided during" would be "determined or pronounced during" or "having come to a determination or resolution that or to do during." The United States understands that the term "decided during" was intended to capture not just a decision during 1992 for 1992, but also, as the EC indicates, a decision in 1992 of the support to be granted in a future year, in particular the EC's decision during 1992 for future years. The term "authorized during" would not appear to capture all of these dimensions of the term "decided during". In fact, a measure could be "authorized" during 1992 based on a "decision" during an earlier year so the two terms are not synonymous.
54. Please identify all United States legal and regulatory and administrative instruments decided during the marketing year 1992, with the respective dates of decision, that decided support for upland cotton. BRA, USA
104. The level of support decided during marketing year 1992 was to ensure a rate of return to producers of 72.9 cents per pound. Numerous legal, regulatory, and administrative instruments "determined" or "pronounced" this support. This level of support was first determined or pronounced by the 1990 Act, which covered the 1991-1995 marketing years. This legislation stated that "[t]he established price for upland cotton shall not be less than $0.729 per pound" for deficiency payments59 and promised to make up the difference between that price and the higher of the (1) marketing loan rate or (2) market price. The 1990 Act was enacted on 28 November 1990. We note that the established price was set at "not less than" 72.9 cents per pound; that is, the Secretary of Agriculture was given some discretion to set the effective price so long as this did not fall below 72.9 cents. The Secretary, in fact, did not decide to alter this effective price prior to, during, or after the 1992 marketing year.
105. The Secretary decided on the marketing loan rate applicable for the 1992 crop via a series of regulations. A proposed rule was published on 13 September 1991, at 56 Federal Register 46574. The final decision on a loan rate of 52.35 cents per pound was announced on 31 October 1991, published on 20 April 1992, at 57 Federal Register 14326.60 Those determinations applied to all marketings during marketing year 1992.
106. The United States decided to maintain the effective price for deficiency payments and loan rate for marketing loans at those levels during the 1992 marketing year as reflected in several published documents. The 1 January 1993, Code of Federal Regulations (Exhibit US-3) codified these levels of support.61 The 1992 Supplement to the US Code also codified the legislated effective price of "not less than" 72.9 cents per pound. In addition, the Department of Agriculture published an upland cotton fact sheet in September 1992 announcing that "[t]he 1992 target price [for deficiency payments] is 72.9 cents per pound" and the "1992 loan rate . . . is 52.35 cents per pound".62

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-102
107. Finally, we note that in anticipation of the 1993 crop year the Department of Agriculture also initially pronounced the level of support for the 1993 crop year during the 1992 marketing year. On 24 March 1993, regulations were published at 58 Federal Register 15755 setting the marketing loan rate at 52.35 cents per pound and leaving undisturbed the effective price for deficiency payments at 72.9 cents per pound.63 Thus, the support decided for the 1993 crop was the same as that decided for the 1992 crop: to ensure producer support of 72.9 cents per pound of upland cotton.64
55. Please provide a copy of the instrument in which the rate of support for upland cotton during the marketing year 1992 was decided, indicating the date of the decision. USA
108. As indicated in the US answer to Question 54 from the Panel, the United States has provided copies of multiple legal, regulatory, and administrative instruments and publications reflecting the rate of support decided during marketing year 1992. These multiple decisions stem from the fact that an effective price and marketing loan rate were first published in advance of the 1992 marketing year in order to allow producers to become familiar with the programmes; subsequently, the Secretary of Agriculture decided not to change either the effective price (72.9 cents per pound) or the marketing loan rate (52.35 cents per pound), despite having the authority to do so.
56. Could the United States please explain how support granted under legislation that dates back to 1990 can have been support "decided during the marketing year 1992"? USA
109. Payments during the 1992 marketing year were made pursuant to the 1990 Act, which directed the Secretary of Agriculture to make marketing loan payments and deficiency payments (as well as Step 2 payments). The 1990 Act, however, was only the first decision on the level of support. The Act provided that the marketing loan rate could "not be reduced below 50 cents per pound".65 The 1990 Act also stated that the "established price for upland cotton shall not be less than $0.729 per pound".66 Thus, the Secretary had discretion to alter those rates of support.
110. The Secretary decided to set the marketing loan rate at 52.35 cents per pound in April 1992 but also decided not to change the implementing regulations establishing the effective price for deficiency payments. Similarly, during the 1992 marketing year, the Secretary had the discretion to raise the deficiency payment target price above 72.9 cents per pound and to raise the marketing loan rate above 52.35 cents per pound but decided not to. Documents published during 1992 evidence this decision: the 1992 supplement to the United States Code published in January 1993 reflects the decision not to alter the statutory provisions relating to upland cotton rates. The 1993 Code of Federal Regulations was published in January 1993 and also reflects the decision not to alter the regulatory rate provisions. Finally, when the upland cotton fact sheet was published in September 1992, the effective price and marketing loan rate were left unchanged, reflecting the Secretary's decision not to change the level of support.
111. In this case, the support determined or pronounced by US measures during the 1992 marketing year was also the support determined or pronounced for the 1992 marketing year. This result is entirely consistent with the Peace Clause text; in fact, it provides certainty to both Members seeking to provide support within Peace Clause limits and Members seeking to understand whether the Peace Clause has been breached.
63A proposed rule for the 1993 crop was published on 29 September 1992. The 1993 rates were announced on 2 November 1992, and published in the 24 March Notice.
64We note that one distinction made by the 24 March 2003 regulations between the 1993 crop and the 1992 crop was that the acreage reduction program percentage was lowered from 10 per cent in 1992 to 7.5 per cent in 1993.

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-103
112. Thus, the 1990 Act initially established a level of support applicable to the 1991-95 crops. The US Congress could have changed the 72.9 cents per pound level at any time during MY 1992, but it decided not to. The Secretary of Agriculture also had discretion to alter the level of support (that is, to raise it) but also decided not to. Thus, 72.9 cents per pound was decided and remained decided as the level of support for each day of the 1992 marketing year.
57. If the United States decided on a rate of support for MY1992, does that not mean that it decided on whatever budgetary outlay was required to meet that rate of support, even if the exact amount was not known at that time? USA
113. The Peace Clause proviso establishes the benchmark for comparison: the support "decided" during the 1992 marketing year. To say that the United States "determined" or "pronounced" an indefinite amount of budgetary outlays would not fit those meanings of the term. The United States could also not have come to a "determination or resolution" to make any budgetary outlay since that outlay would be determined by market prices during the year, not by the US Government. To read support "decided" as encompassing not only the explicit rate of support set out in US measures but also "whatever budgetary outlay was required to meet that rate of support, even if the exact amount was not known at the time," would also appear to make the Peace Clause comparison impossible. That is, because both during the 1992 marketing year and under the 2002 Act the support decided would be "whatever budgetary outlay was required to meet that rate of support," both budgetary outlay "decisions" by the United States would appear to be unlimited, and one could not be in excess of the other. Alternatively, one could reason that a decision to provide whatever budgetary outlays would be necessary implies that the 1992 decided level would be higher because, even if prices fell to zero, the higher nominal level in 1992 would mean higher budgetary outlays.
114. The only support "decided" by the United States was the 72.9 cents per pound level of support. In effect, the United States provided a revenue floor for producers by guaranteeing a rate of income for plantings. The United States has never exceeded that level of incentive "for the commodity." Brazil's approach, which would ascribe to the United States a decision to make budgetary outlays resulting from differences between market prices and the level of support, is an effort to impose something akin to an AMS limit on US support for upland cotton. (We note, however, that Brazil cannot simply argue for calculating an AMS for upland cotton because that would exclude non-product-specific support, which Brazil wishes to include in the Peace Clause comparison, and would not require that support be measured through budgetary outlays.) Members considered and rejected any product-specific AMS limits in the Uruguay Round, however, and such a concept may not be overlaid onto the Article 13 language. The United States has introduced payments decoupled from production precisely to lower the incentive to produce the marginal pound of cotton and avoid exceeding the product-specific level of support of 72.9 cents per pound.
59. Should the rate of support as indicated in Article 13(b)(ii) include the market price? If so, why is it appropriate to include it in the comparison under Article 13(b)(ii)? BRA, USA
115. No, the market price is not relevant for purposes of the Peace Clause comparison. As indicated in the US answers to Questions 48 and 57 from the Panel, the benchmark for that comparison is the support "decided" during the 1992 marketing year. That support was decided by the United States as a rate of support: 72.9 cents per pound. The actual amount of expenditures necessary to provide that support depended on the market prices during the marketing year. However, these prices were not "determined" or "pronounced" by the United States and therefore cannot have been (or be) part of any US decision.
60. Can you provide information on support decided in 1992 and the years with which you believe it should be compared, on a per support programme / per unit of production/per

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-104
annum basis? If possible, please specify how, if at all, budget outlays may be transposed into units of production, and which units of production are best to use. BRA, USA
116. The United States has explained that the product-specific support decided during the 1992 marketing year for upland cotton was 72.9 cents per pound through the combined effect of the target price for deficiency payments and the loan rate for marketing loans. This rate was the only support "decided" by the United States as evidenced by the relevant legislation, regulations, and programme announcements. By comparison, the product-specific support that upland cotton support measures currently grant is only 52 cents per pound through the loan rate for the marketing loan programme.
117. The United States believes that any analysis that takes budgetary outlays into account necessarily will not reflect the support "decided" by the United States. Because US domestic support measures are largely dependent on a price-gap, budgetary outlays will reflect prevailing market prices during the applicable marketing year, prices the United States cannot decide. Budgetary outlays will also reflect, for the product-specific support that marketing loans grant, various producer decisions on programme participation, timing of receipt of payments, and production levels. Again, these factors cannot be decided by the United States. Thus, given the way in which the challenged US measures decide the level of support, the Peace Clause comparison may only be made on the basis of rates of support, not budgetary outlays.
61. Does the United States consider that Article 13(b)(ii) permits a comparison on any basis other than a per pound basis? USA
118. Article 13(b)(ii) requires that the benchmark for comparison be the support "decided" during the 1992 marketing year. The United States decided on an a rate of support of 72.9 cents per pound during the 1992 marketing year. Therefore, the evaluation must be whether challenged measures grant product-specific support in excess of that decided during the 1992 marketing year ­ that is, in excess of the 1992 rate of support. Were the relevant US domestic support measures structured differently, the term "decided" might imply a different comparison.
66. Could you please comment on the relative merits of each of the following calculation methods for the purposes of the comparison of support to upland cotton with 1992, irrespective of whether a particular measure should be included or excluded:
(a) Total budgetary outlays (Brazil's approach). USA
119. As stated in the US answer to Question 60 from the Panel, the United States believes that any analysis that takes budgetary outlays into account necessarily will not reflect the support "decided" by the United States. Because some US domestic support measures are dependent on a price-gap (for example, marketing loans), budgetary outlays will reflect prevailing market prices during the applicable marketing year, prices the United States cannot decide. Budgetary outlays will also reflect, for the product-specific support that marketing loans grant, various producer decisions on programme participation, timing of receipt of payments, and production levels. Again, these factors cannot be decided by the United States. Thus, given the way in which the challenged US measures decide the level of support, the Peace Clause comparison may only be made with respect to these measures on the basis of rates of support, not budgetary outlays.
(b) Budgetary outlays per unit of upland cotton: Could you please calculate and provide an estimate for the marketing years 1992 and 1999-2002, respectively, and draw attention to any factors/qualifications that the Panel would need to be aware of. BRA, USA
120. For the reasons stated in response to Question 66(a), any analysis involving budgetary outlays necessarily will not reflect the support "decided" by the United States. A budgetary outlays per unit

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-105
of upland cotton approach thus would not only be based on a faulty premise, but to calculate outlays per unit might also necessitate an ex post or retrospective analysis. Again, this cannot reflect the support "decided" by the United States.
(d) Per unit rate of support for upland cotton (Prof. Sumner's approach at the first session of the first substantive meeting ). USA
121. The United States continues to examine Mr. Sumner's approach to calculating a per-unit subsidy rate. We will present a detailed critique of Mr. Sumner's analysis in our rebuttal submission. Here, we limit our comments to two points.
122. First, as with the budgetary outlays approach favoured by Brazil, this per unit rate of support analysis ascribes to the United States choices made by producers themselves. For example, the first line of Sumner's analysis of the deficiency payment programme stated: "The following qualifications and adjustments must [] be made to the level of support provided by the deficiency payment programme: (1) payments were made only if a farm chose to participate in the deficiency payment programme; in 1992, farms representing 11 per cent (1.64 million acres) of the total `effective' upland cotton acreage base (14.9 million acres) did not agree to participate in the programme and hence cotton production on this land could not receive support."67 Sumner makes a similar argument and adjustment for the 1992 loan rate.68
123. Attempting to adjust the per unit rate of support to take account of producers that chose not to participate in the programme is a serious conceptual error. In economic terms, a farmer that participated in the upland cotton programme received full programme benefits; a farmer who chose not to participate did not. Averaging these numbers produces a "per unit rate of support" that no cotton farmer ever could have expected to receive.
124. Nor could a Member have "decided" such a level of support. In legal terms, an individual producer's choices on programme participation do not reflect any decision by the US Government. Thus, estimated rates of support that reflect these producer decisions are not relevant to the Peace Clause analysis under Article 13(b)(ii). We will discuss other conceptual errors in Sumner's approach in our rebuttal submission.
125. In reviewing Sumner's analysis, the United States was particularly struck by another point. The Panel may recall Brazil commenting at the first panel meeting that Sumner's calculations were not entirely unfavourable to the US position. A look at Appendix Table 1 to Sumner's statement (Exhibit BRA-105) reveals why.
126. Even using Sumner's flawed calculations, if one excludes the non-product-specific support that Brazil is attempting to "allocate" to upland cotton from the table, Sumner's analysis supports the United States, not Brazil. That is, Sumner's estimated per unit rate of support was lower in every year from marketing year 1999 through marketing year 2002 than the level of support during marketing year 1992:

127. Thus, even were one to accept for purposes of argument Sumner's approach, comparing the product-specific support the challenged measures grant to the product-specific support decided during marketing year 1992 reveals that in no marketing year from 1999 through 2002 did the level of support exceed the marketing year 1992 level. Under Article 13(b)(ii), then, Sumner's own analysis reveals that US domestic support measures that conform fully to the provisions of Article 6 are exempt from actions based on Peace Clause-specified WTO subsidies provisions.
67. The Panel requests the parties to calculate and submit estimates of the AMS for upland cotton for marketing years 1992, 1999, 2000, 2001 and 2002. For this purpose the parties are each requested to submit AMS calculations for upland cotton (using the budgetary-outlay/non-price gap methodology employed by the United States in respect of cotton in its DS Notifications (e.g., G/AG/N/USA/43) and using the formats and supporting tables in document G/AG/2) on the same basis as would be the case in calculating a product specific AMS for the purposes of the calculation of the "Total Current AMS" in any year in accordance with the relevant provisions, including as appropriate Article 1(a), (b) and (h), Article 6 and Annex 3 to the Agreement. BRA, USA
128. The United States has calculated a product-specific Aggregate Measurement of Support for upland cotton for marketing years 1992, 1999, 2000, 2001, and 2002, as explained below. This table summarizes the results of those calculations, and the following paragraphs provide additional detail:

129. For marketing year 1992, the United States has used official data on budgetary outlays71 to calculate the upland cotton Aggregate Measurement of Support, except for other product-specific support in the form of storage payments and interest subsidies. The latter payment amounts are based on estimates by the US Department of Agriculture. The calculations, in millions of US dollars, are as follows:

130. To calculate the upland cotton Aggregate Measurement of Support for marketing year 1999, the United States has used official budgetary outlays data for loan deficiency payments, marketing loan gains, certificate exchange gains, user marketing certificates, and the 1999 crop year cottonseed payment. For storage payments and interest subsidies, we have used estimates by the US Department of Agriculture as notified to the WTO. The calculations, in millions of US dollars, are as follows:

70As explained further below, the United States has calculated the 2002 Aggregate Measurement of
Support for upland cotton as of the date of panel establishment, 18 March 2003. 71In light of the question from the Panel, we have used budgetary outlays to estimate payments.

To calculate the upland cotton Aggregate Measurement of Support for marketing year 2000, the United States has again used official budgetary outlays data for loan deficiency payments, marketing loan gains, certificate exchange gains, and user marketing certificates; the amounts set by legislation for the 2000 crop year cottonseed payments; and estimates by the US Department of Agriculture for storage payments and interest subsidies.

132. For marketing year 2001, the United States has used estimates by the US Department of Agriculture for storage payments and interest subsidies and official data on budgetary outlays for all other payments to calculate the upland cotton Aggregate Measurement of Support. The calculations, in millions of US dollars, are as follows:

133. For crop year 2002, the United States has provided unofficial data on budgetary outlays as of 18 March 2003, the date of establishment of the Panel, for marketing loan gains, certificate exchange gains, loan deficiency payments, and user marketing certificates. Because the crop year has just ended (as of 31 July 2003), official budgetary outlay data is not yet available. For the 2002 crop year cottonseed payment, the United States has used the amount set by legislation ($50 million). We use a crop-year's-end estimate by the US Department of Agriculture for storage payments and interest subsidies. The calculation, in millions of US dollars, is as follows:

134. We note that it would not be appropriate for the Panel to examine payments made after the date of panel establishment, on which the Panel's terms of reference were set. Measures taken after the Panel was established cannot be within the Panel's terms of reference. However, for the Panel's convenience, we have also estimated an Aggregate Measurement of Support for the entire crop year 2002, using US Department of Agriculture projections of all payments with respect to the 2002 crop

73See Exhibit US-19 (Marketing Year 2002 Loan Deficiency Payment and Price Support Cumulative Activity As of 3/12/2003). Upland cotton data is shown in the row marked "UP."

68. Could you please clarify the result of the calculations of, and the meaning of the title, in Appendix Table 1 "Estimated per unit Subsidy Rates by Programme and Year" in Annex 2 to Exhibit BRA-105, page 12. Why are the numbers calculated for marketing loans considered to be subsidies? Could the Panel, for example, read the "total level of support" (bottom line of the table) as the effective support price for upland cotton or the maximum rate of support for upland cotton? BRA, USA
135. The United States looks forward to reviewing Brazil's explanation of its Appendix Table 1 to Annex 2 to Exhibit BRA-105.
69. Can the United States confirm that the "marketing year" for upland cotton is 1 August to 31 July ? Can the United States confirm the Panel's understanding that USDA data for the "crop year" corresponds to the "marketing year"? USA
136. The United States confirms that the "marketing year" for upland cotton is 1 August to 31 July.75 In response to a question from the Panel at the first meeting, we also communicate that payments listed in the Upland Cotton Fact Sheet (Ex. Bra-4) are for monies spent with respect to cotton harvested in a particular crop year, not necessarily for payments made during the marketing year.
EXPORT CREDIT GUARANTEE PROGRAMMES
71. (a) Is an export credit guarantee a financial contribution in the form of a "potential direct transfer of funds or liabilities (e.g. loan guarantee)" within the meaning of Article 1.1(a)(1)(i) of the SCM Agreement? Why or why not? Does it confer a benefit within the meaning of Article 1.1(b)? Why or why not? If so, to whom? USA

74Exhibit US-19. 757 Code of Federal Regulations 1412.103.

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-111
(b) How, if at all, would these elements be relevant to the claims of Brazil, and the United States response thereto? BRA, USA
137. (a) For the reasons stated in its first written submission76 and in response to Question 71(b), the United States does not believe that the appropriate analysis of the US export credit guarantee programme should begin with the Subsidies Agreement, much less Article 1of that Agreement. The text of Article 10.2 defers WTO obligations for export credit guarantees until disciplines are internationally agreed, such as within the OECD or WTO. Under the Agriculture Agreement, the provisions of the Subsidies Agreement "apply subject to the provisions of this Agreement,"77 and the export subsidy disciplines of Article 3.1(a) of the Subsidies Agreement expressly apply "[e]xcept as provided in the Agreement on Agriculture."78 Thus, the appropriate analysis would begin and end with Agriculture Agreement Article 10.2.
138. Even were the Subsidies Agreement relevant to US export credit guarantees, given that export credit guarantees are covered by item (j) of the Illustrative List of Export Subsidies, the appropriate mode of analysis under the Subsidies Agreement is to examine whether the programme is covering its long-term operating costs and losses.
139. (b) Article 3 of the SCM Agreement specifically states that Article 3.1(a), prohibiting export subsidies, applies "[e]xcept as provided in the Agreement on Agriculture". Article 21.1 of the Agriculture Agreement states that "[t]he provisions of GATT 1994 and of other Multilateral Trade Agreements in Annex 1A to the WTO Agreement shall apply subject to the provisions of this Agreement". Under Article 10.2 of the Agreement on Agriculture, the negotiators specifically deferred the application of export subsidy disciplines on agricultural export credit guarantee programmes like those of the United States. Any incidental "benefit" of any such measures is therefore irrelevant. Similarly, even if a particular (non-export credit) measure comprised a contribution and conferred a benefit for purposes of the Subsidies Agreement, to the extent the resulting subsidy was contingent on export performance, such export subsidy might nevertheless be permitted under the Agreement on Agriculture if within a Member's applicable reduction commitment.
73. The Panel could arguably take the view that Articles 1 and 3 of the SCM Agreement were relevant in assessing the WTO-consistency of United States export credit guarantees. The United States has yet to submit any evidence or argumentation on this point, either as potential context for interpretation of the terms in Article 10 of the Agreement on Agriculture or in relation to Brazil's claims under the SCM Agreement. The Panel would therefore appreciate United States views in respect of this situation, and invites the United States to submit relevant argumentation and evidence. USA
140. The United States does not believe that Brazil has submitted evidence and argumentation that would establish a prima facie case in favour of Brazil's claims, in particular in light of Article 10.2 of the Agriculture Agreement. However, the United States will review Brazil's submissions, including its responses to these questions, and provide any further response in the US submission.
74. If the Panel decides to refer to provisions of the SCM Agreement for contextual guidance in the interpretation of the terms in Article 10 of the Agreement on Agriculture, should the Panel refer to item (j) or Articles 1 and 3 of the SCM Agreement or both? BRA, USA
76US First Written Submission, paras. 167-170. 77Agriculture Agreement, Article 21.1. 78Subsidies Agreement, Article 3.1.

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-112
141. As the United States has argued, the first point of analysis is Article 10.2 of the Agreement on Agriculture, in which Members agreed that they would only provide export credit guarantees in conformity with internationally agreed disciplines, which they undertook to develop. That is, Article 10.2 indicates that no "internationally agreed disciplines" currently exist. The obligation with respect to export credit guarantees is, in effect, a work programme to establish a future discipline. Brazil has not contested that challenged US export credit guarantee programmes are within the scope of Article 10.2. Therefore, neither item (j) nor Articles 1 and 3 of the Subsidies Agreement are relevant to the Panel's analysis of Article 10.2. We do note, however, that item (j) of the Illustrative List of Export Subsidies was agreed in the Uruguay Round, and, in fact, had previously formed part of the Illustrative List under the Tokyo Round Subsidies Code. Thus, the fact that Members had agreed on item (j) and yet, in Article 10.2, agreed to "undertake to work toward the development of internationally agreed disciplines to govern the provision of export credits, export credit guarantees" and, once agreed, only to provide export credit guarantee programmes "in conformity with" such developed and agreed disciplines, suggests that item (j) does not impose disciplines on export credit guarantees for agricultural goods.
142. Context for Article 10 is found in Article 9.1 of the Agreement on Agriculture, which describes specific practices that constitute export subsidies for purposes of the Agreement on Agriculture. Export credit guarantees were not listed among such practices. As to the practices described in Article 9.1, no recourse is necessary to Articles 1 and 3 of the SCM Agreement to determine whether a particular practice is an export subsidy. Article 1(e) of the Agreement on Agriculture defines an export subsidy only as a subsidy contingent on export performance. To determine the applicability of Article 10.1 to a particular measure not described in Article 9.1 first requires a determination whether a subsidy exists. In this regard, Article 1of the SCM Agreement would provide relevant context.
75. The Panel's attention has been drawn to Article 14(c) of the SCM Agreement (see e.g. written third party submission of Canada) and to the panel report in DS 222 CanadaExport Credits and Loan Guarantees. How and to what extent are Article 14(c) of the SCM Agreement, and the cited panel report, relevant to the issue of whether or not the United States export credit guarantee programmes confer a "benefit"? What would be the appropriate market benchmark to use for any comparison? Please cite any other relevant material. BRA, USA
143. For reasons set out in more detail in the US answer to Question 71(b) and Question 71(c) from the Panel, the United States does not believe that Article 14(c) is relevant to the Panel's analysis. An appropriate analysis of the US export credit guarantee programme begins and ends with Article 10.2 of the Agreement on Agriculture. Even were the Subsidies Agreement relevant to US export credit guarantees, the only appropriate mode of analysis under the Subsidies Agreement is to examine whether US export credit guarantee programmes are covering their long-term operating costs and losses under item (j) of the Illustrative List of Export Subsidies.
76. How does the United States respond to Brazil's statement that : "...export credit guarantees for exports of agricultural exports [sic] are not available on the marketplace by commercial lenders."? USA
144. Brazil is incorrect. Commercial insurers do offer export credit insurance covering agricultural commodities. According to a background paper on export credits prepared by the WTO Secretariat, "While guarantees could be unconditional, they usually have conditions attached to them, so that in practice there is little distinction between credits which are guaranteed and credits which are subject to insurance."79 However, for the sake of completeness we wish to note that such private insurance is structured differently than CCC credit guarantees. Most commonly, private insurers offer portfolio
79See Export Credits and Related Facilities, G/AG/NG/S/13 (26 June 2000).

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-113
coverage, covering multiple customers and transactions for a particular exporter. Because the coverage is not based on individual transactions (like CCC's coverage), it may be difficult or impossible to discern which particular transactions involve agricultural commodities.
77. How does the United States interpretation of "long term operating costs and losses" in item (j) as claims paid give meaning to both "costs" and "losses"? Do claims paid represent "losses" or "costs" or both? If claims paid is represented by "losses", what would go into the "cost" element of item (j)? Could the United States expand on why it disagrees with the items which Brazil identifies for inclusion in the examination to be conducted under item (j)? USA
145. Item (j) applies to three different types of programmes: export credits, export credit guarantees, and insurance. In the case of the latter two types of programmes, the provider will necessarily incur claims from time to time. In the case of direct export credits (the first type of programme), the provider will experience defaults on occasion. To the extent such claims or defaults exceed revenue from whatever source it may be derived, the net result would be a loss arising from operations. In an accounting sense such result would constitute an "operating loss."
146. In addition, it is appropriate to identify and allocate costs necessary to operate such programmes. For example, the United States agrees that certain administrative expenses should be allocated to the operation of the export credit guarantee programmes, and an annual figure is attributed as administrative expense in the budget of the United States. Other costs necessary for the operation of a programme would constitute "operating costs" of such programme.
147. Were item (j) to be relevant in this dispute, therefore, that item compels an examination of losses derived from the operation of the programme plus the costs necessarily allocable to the programme for its operation. In the case of US export credit guarantee programmes, as reflected in paragraph 173 and accompanying tables of the US first written submission, the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) charges and receives premiums from applicants. In addition, CCC receives post-claim revenue through late payments and rescheduling. As reflected in the tables, with respect to cotton, such revenue exceeds the relevant claims experience. The United States has, therefore, not incurred an operating loss.
148. It is appropriate to allocate operating costs of the programme in the final analysis within the meaning of item (j). The United States disagrees, however, with the allegation of Brazil concerning interest allocation and the manner in which it attempts to ascribe figures from the US budget to operating costs for purposes of item (j). These items are addressed specifically in the US response to Question 81 from the Panel.
78. Can the United States provide supporting documentation for data used relating to "costs and losses" in paragraph 173? Could the United States confirm that the figures cited in paragraph 173 of its first written submission relate to the SCGP? Why did the United States cite these figures after stating that it is not possible to make any assessment of the long-term operating costs and losses of this programme? USA
149. The United States maintains a comprehensive electronic data base of export credit guarantee programme activity. The data base is updated on a regular basis and is the source of the data shown in paragraph 173 and accompanying table. Data is recorded in the system at the time of each transaction. These include such items as claim payments, recoveries, rescheduling agreements, and fees received.
150. As indicated in the tables accompanying paragraph 173, the figures shown in paragraph 173 relate to GSM-102 in the first table and SCGP in the second table. During the ten fiscal years reflected in the tables, no GSM-103 export credit guarantees were issued with respect to cotton.

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-114
79. In respect of what time periods does Article 13(c) require an assessment of conformity with Part V of the Agreement on Agriculture? How does this affect, if at all, your interpretation of Article 13(b)? BRA, USA
151. Article 13(c) applies to "export subsidies that conform fully to the provisions of Part V of th[e Agriculture] Agreement, as reflected in each Member's Schedule." Part V of the Agreement, and in particular Article 8, establishes that "Each Member undertakes not to provide export subsidies otherwise than in conformity with this Agreement and with the commitments as specified in that Member's Schedule." Those export subsidy reduction commitments, which are expressed in both export quantity and budgetary outlay terms, apply on a yearly basis.80 Accordingly, a Member may be in conformity one year and not in conformity in another with regard to any particular commodity subject to reduction commitments.
152. If a Member has provided export subsidies to a particular commodity in any one year in excess of the applicable reduction commitments, then export subsidies for that commodity during such year would not "conform fully to the provisions of Part V", and those subsidies would not have Peace Clause protection. In a subsequent year, a Member may again comply with its export subsidy commitments. Its export subsidies would then conform fully to Part V of the Agreement and would again receive Peace Clause protection.
153. Similarly, a failure by a Member to comply in a given year with the criteria in Article 13(b) would lift the exemption from action for those domestic support measures only for the year of the breach. Measures (subsidies) in a later year would remain exempt from action so long as those measures in the given year comply with the conditions in Article 13(b)(ii). This conclusion flows from the text of the Peace Clause (measures must conform to Article 6, and Members' final bound commitment levels are expressed in yearly terms) as well as the nature of the subsidies challenged by Brazil (recurring subsidies that are provided yearly and expensed in the year given). For further explanation of the US interpretation of Article 13(b), please see the US answers to Questions 33 and 35 from the Panel.
81. How does the United States respond to the following in Brazil's oral statement: USA
(a) paragraph 122 (rescheduled guarantees)
154. Brazil is correct to assert "debt rescheduling does not involve any reduction in the value of outstanding debt". A rescheduling does not involve debt forgiveness. As reflected in the terms of the various rescheduling agreements, outstanding interest is capitalized, and interest accrues on such capitalized interest as well as on outstanding principal. Further, the United States expects to recover in full pursuant to such rescheduling.
155. Therefore, from an accounting perspective, rescheduled amounts are counted as receivables, not losses, and are reflected as such in paragraph 173 of the US First Written Submission. Contrary to the assertion of Brazil, the United States does in fact collect on the rescheduling. The history of rescheduled Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) export credit guarantee claims over the long-term (the 10-year period 1993-2002) confirms this position. All rescheduled claims are currently performing. In other words, all payments due up to this point under these agreements have been received.
80With the exception of Agriculture Agreement Article 9.2(b), which is no longer applicable.

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-115
(c) paragraphs 125 ff. (guaranteed loan subsidy)81
156. The Credit Reform Act of 1990 establishes the procedures and parameters for US credit and credit guarantee programmes. In accordance with the provisions of that Act, the budgeting and accounting for US credit programmes, including the CCC export credit guarantee programmes, are based on the estimated lifetime costs to the Federal Government of making the credit available. In the case of credit guarantees, those costs are based on estimated payments by the Government to cover defaults and delinquencies, interest subsidies, and other requirements, and payments to the Government, including origination and other fees, penalties, and recoveries.
157. In presenting the annual budget, the subsidy costs of the programme reflect an estimate of the long-term costs to the Government. This estimate reflects various assumptions regarding credit risk, interest costs, and other factors that will apply over the lifetime period of the credit. At the time the budget is prepared, these costs are presented as estimates as of the date the budget is prepared ­ that is, they are a snapshot of the estimated costs. In fact, Brazil acknowledges in paragraph 125 of its oral statement that the "guaranteed loan subsidy" entry in the annual US budget is an estimate of the cost of the guarantees projected to be issued.
158. A fundamental tenet of credit reform accounting is the requirement that the performance of the credit be tracked over its lifetime. This is accomplished by tracking each cohort of credit until the credit period has expired or lapsed. A cohort consists of all transactions associated with each type of guarantee issued during a particular year ­ for example, all guarantees issued during fiscal year 2002 comprise a distinct cohort.
159. Activity (disbursement, repayment, claims, etc.) occurs within a given cohort over the life of all guarantees that were disbursed against that cohort. To view the data and activity strictly on an annual basis and not by cohort limits the utility of the data and distorts the costs of the programme. Not until the cohort is closed can one make an assessment as to whether or not that particular cohort represents a cost to the Federal Government.
160. All cohorts for the CCC export credit guarantee programmes under credit reform are still open although cohorts for 1994 and 1995 should close this year. At present, the 1994 cohort has a total net downward subsidy re-estimate of $116 million. The original subsidy cost estimate for the 1994 programme was $123 million; thus, applying the downward re-estimate, the net cost of the programme to the US Government is currently projected at $7 million. The 1995 cohort has a total net downward subsidy re-estimate of $149 million, versus an original subsidy estimate of $113 million. Thus, the net cost of the 1995 programme is a receipt of $36 million to the US Government. For 1994 and 1995 together, the total net receipt to the US Government is $29 million.
161. The experience of 1994 and 1995 is viewed as representative of the costs of the CCC export credit programmes generally, and it is expected that, once the cohorts for other years of credit activity are closed, they will follow closely the experience of the 1994 and 1995 programmes.
(d) paragraphs 127-129 (re-estimates, etc.)
162. As discussed in response to Question 81(c), it is necessary to understand the difference between activity that occurs on a fiscal year basis as opposed to the estimates and re-estimates of subsidy that calculate net present value over the life of the programme. Although estimates and re-estimates are made annually for each cohort, these include both actual data to date and estimates of future activity for the remainder of the life of the cohort.
81The US answer to Question 81(b) follows the answer 81(d), which discusses budget re-estimates.

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-116
163. With the exception of 2002, all cohorts for annual export credit programming since the inception of credit reform accounting in 1992, have a cumulative downward re-estimate. The net total for all cohorts for guarantees issued since 1992 currently stands at a downward re-estimate of $1.9 billion. This experience with re-estimates indicates that performance under the programme has been better than originally projected and that the original cost estimates for those programming years as presented in the annual US budget were too high. This experience also demonstrates that the assertion by Brazil at paragraph 129 of its oral statement that the original estimate of "guaranteed loan subsidy" line in the budget is an "ideal basis" for determining the costs of the programme is in error. Those estimates will be re-estimated on an annual basis until each cohort is closed and, as demonstrated above, to date the re-estimates for each cohort on a net basis have been almost exclusively downward.
(b) paragraph 123 (interest on debt to Treasury)
164. Under the guidelines for credit reform budgeting as established in the Credit Reform Act of 1990, there are two kinds of interest calculations that affect the CCC export guarantee programmes. These calculations are "snapshots" in time and will change annually for a cohort until the cohort has closed. Therefore, any one number shown in the budget for a given year is an estimate. The actual cost of the programme can be determined only when all financial activity for the cohort is completed.
165. An interest rate re-estimate is a component of the annual re-estimates of a cohort, which are made for as long as the guarantees are outstanding. The interest rate re-estimate calculates the difference between the estimated interest at the time the guarantee programme was budgeted and the actual interest at the time the guarantee is disbursed. If the actual interest is higher, the additional cost is shown in the programme account as a re-estimate. It should be noted that this cost would change with subsequent re-estimates in future years depending on the timing of the guarantee disbursement.
166. Interest on borrowings occurs in the financing account only if additional funds beyond those budgeted for a cohort is needed to pay claims. Again, these costs will vary from year to year as borrowings with a particular cohort change and the interest rate varies.
167. It is important to understand that should any interest on borrowings occur, they would be fully reflected in the costs attributed to the individual cohort. Thus, as the costs of the cohort are adjusted during the period it is active, any costs associated with the interest on borrowings are fully reflected in the programme costs. It is, therefore, incorrect to state as Brazil asserts in paragraph 123 that those payments are not fully reflected in the operating costs of the CCC export credit guarantee programmes.
(e) Exhibits BRA-125-127
168. Exhibits BRA-125-127 are pages from the Budget Estimates for the United States Government for fiscal years 1994, 1995, and 2004. These particular pages show one aspect of the budgeting for the CCC export credit guarantee programmes, the Export Loans Programme Account. In and of themselves, they do not reflect all aspects of the budgeting and financing transactions for the programmes. For example, Exhibit 127 for the fiscal year 2004 budget estimates excludes the Export Guarantee Financing Account, which appears on the following page. The data presented in the financing account is important because it presents information on both downward and upward re-estimates for the programme.

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-117
(f) the chart on page 53 of Brazil's oral statement at the first session of the first Panel meeting relating to "Guaranteed Loan Subsidy and Administrative Expenses of US Export Credit Guarantee Programmes GSM-102 GSM 103 and SCGP"?
169. The table on page 53 of Brazil's oral statement at the first panel meeting presents information on budget estimates for the CCC export credit programmes for fiscal years 1992 through 2004. The data presented in the table are correct. However, as discussed previously in the answers to questions 81(c) and 81(d) above, the "guaranteed loan subsidy" is a snapshot estimate of the lifetime costs of the guarantees issued during the course of a given fiscal year. As the cohorts for those guarantees are reviewed annually over their lifetime, those estimates will change and, until the cohorts are closed out, the estimated costs of the programmes are simply that, estimates. Accordingly, Brazil is incorrect in asserting in paragraph 132 of its oral statement that, because the guaranteed loan subsidy line of the annual budget has always reflected a positive net present value, that fact indicates the programmes are "extending a subsidy to borrowers". That statement misinterprets and misrepresents the information presented in the budget.
170. In addition, Brazil makes a statement in paragraph 131 of its oral presentation with regard to the table on page 53 that likewise is incorrect. Brazil asserts that the column heading in the budget for the last completed fiscal year represents "actual" costs for the programme for that particular year. In fact, the numbers appearing in that column simply represent the latest, revised estimate of the costs of the programme for the fiscal year just completed. The estimate of those costs will change over the lifetime of the credit as the cohort for that year is tracked. The term "actual" is used in the column because the revised estimate is based on an actual level of guarantees issued by CCC during the year just completed.
171. Frequently, the level of guarantees issued by CCC in any given year is less than the level projected in the original budget for that year. In the case of the 2002 budget that was released in February 2001, it projected that $3.9 billion of guarantees would be issued by CCC during that year. However, only $3.4 billion of guarantees were actually issued. Thus, the estimate of programme costs in 2002 column of the 2004 budget has been revised to reflect that actual level of activity. Nevertheless, the cost presented in the column remains an estimate, and the estimate will continue to be revised as long as the cohort for 2002 remains active.
172. With respect to the "administrative expenses" that are displayed in the table on page 53 of Brazil's oral statement, the United States has noted elsewhere that those are imputed costs ascribed to the operation of the CCC export credit programmes as a whole.
(g) In respect of (a)-(f) above, how and to what extent do the information and data presented for the export guarantee programmes concerning "programme" and "financing", "summary of loan levels", "subsidy budget authority", "outlay levels", etc., in particular in Exhibits BRA-125-127, reflect "actual costs and losses" of the GSM-102, GSM-102 and SCGP export credit guarantee programmes (see e.g. Brazil's closing oral statement at the first session of the first substantive meeting, paragraph 24)? USA
173. The closing oral statement of Brazil at the first session of the first substantive meeting of the Panel, and paragraph 24 in particular, display a fundamental misunderstanding of the budget and accounting for the CCC export credit programmes. Contrary to what is asserted in that paragraph, the information presented in the annual budget of the United States does in fact represent estimates of the lifetime costs of the programmes. Those estimates are being revised annually to reflect actual performance and, until the cohorts for the annual programmes have been closed out, the actual costs cannot be determined definitively. However, as demonstrated in response to Question 81(d), the

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-118
re-estimates thus far have resulted in a net reduction in the estimated costs of these programmes of over $1.9 billion since the inception of credit reform budgeting in fiscal year 1992.
174. Further, as discussed in response to Question 81(c), the combined net costs of the cohorts associated with the 1994 and 1995 guarantee programmes, which are expected to close this year, are a receipt of $29 million to the Federal Government. Based on those results, the Brazilian claim in paragraph 24 that "operating costs and losses for GSM 102, GSM 103, and SCGP have outpaced premiums collected in every single year since the United States started applying the formula in 1992" is not supportable.
82. Please explain each of the following statements and any possible significance it may have in respect of Brazil's claims about GSM-102 and GSM-103 (7 CFR 1493.10(a)(2), Exhibit BRA-38): BRA, USA
(a) "The programmes operate in cases where credit is necessary to increase or maintain US exports to a foreign market and where US financial institutions would be unwilling to provide financing without CCC's guarantee. (7 CFR 1493.10(a)(2), Exhibit BRA-38)
175. The export credit guarantee programmes are generally made available in connection with middle-tier economies in which liquidity is constricted. In such cases, cash sales for all suppliers are not occurring readily. US financial institutions may face requirements regarding loan-loss reserves that impede their ability to lend.
(b) "The programmes are operated in a manner intended not to interfere with markets for cash sales. The programmes are targeted toward those countries where the guarantee is necessary to secure financing of the exports but which have sufficient financial strength so that foreign exchange will be available for scheduled payments." (7 CFR 1493.10(a)(2) Exhibit BRA-38)
176. The export credit guarantee programmes are intended to operate and indeed are applied in a manner not to displace cash sales. As liquidity improves in certain countries, the use of the programme recedes. This explains, in part, the dramatic reduction in US export credit guarantees since the years immediately preceding the inception of the WTO Agreement.
177. The following table shows the dollar value of guarantees provided by the United States in US fiscal years 1992-1994, along with the average value of guarantees for fiscal years 1995 - 2002:

Fiscal Year(s) 1992 1993 1994 1995 - 2002

Guarantee Value (Millions of USD) $5,671.8 $3,853.7 $3,177.4 $3,061.9

(c) "In providing this credit guarantee facility, CCC seeks to expand market opportunities for US agricultural exporters and assist long-term market

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-119
development for US agricultural commodities." (7 CFR 1493.10(a)(2) Exhibit BRA-38)
178. Although the goal of the export credit guarantee programmes is to expand market opportunities, such goal alone has no bearing on the proper characterization of the programmes, the measures in dispute, or the conformity of the application of such programmes with the WTO obligations of the United States. Moreover, the United States is statutorily compelled to be mindful not to provide any such guarantees in connection with any country that the Secretary of Agriculture determines cannot adequately service the debt associated with such sales, nor does the United States provide guarantees in connection with any foreign bank that it has not approved and with respect to which it has not established an exposure limit.
84. Is the Panel correct in understanding that, under the GSM-102 and GSM-103 programmes, the exporter pays a fee calculated on the dollar amount guaranteed, based on a schedule of rates applicable to different credit periods? How and on what basis are the fee rates fixed? Do the fee rates ever change? If so, how and for what reason? Would it be necessary to amend the legislation and/or regulations in order to adjust the fee rates? USA
179. Fees paid by an exporter participating in either the GSM-102 or GSM-103 programme vary by the guaranteed dollar value of the transaction, the repayment period, and the principal repayment interval (annual or semi-annual). A schedule of current fees is attached as Exhibit US-20. Section 211(b)(2) of the Agricultural Trade Act of 1978, 7 U.S.C. 5641(b)(2), limits the origination fee in connection with transactions under the GSM-102 programme, except for those transactions under the CCC Facility Guarantee Programme, to no more than 1 per cent of the amount of credit to be guaranteed. There is no other legislation or regulation addressing the specific fee rates.
180. Other than the legislative restriction noted above, the CCC sets and changes the fee rates as it deems appropriate. Fee rates are changed via a press announcement to the public. The most recent change in guarantee fee rates occurred on 1 October 2002, at which time the fee schedule was modified to include rates for transactions with 30- and 60-day repayment periods. Previously, the fee schedule had been adjusted to accommodate variable interest rates as opposed to fixed rates. Legislative amendment is not required to change the fee rates unless the rates for the GSM-102 programme are to exceed 1 per cent of the guaranteed dollar value of a transaction. Neither is it necessary to amend the programme regulations in order to change the fee rates.
85. Is the Panel correct in understanding that, under the SCGP, the exporter pays a fee for the guarantee calculated on the guaranteed portion of the value of the export sales? How and on what basis are the fee rates fixed? Do the fee rates ever change? If so, how and for what reason? Would it be necessary to amend the legislation and/or regulations in order to adjust the fee rates? Please explain any "risk" assessment involved in the programme. USA
181. Under the SCGP, the exporter pays a fee to CCC based on the guaranteed dollar value of the export transaction and the repayment period. The current guarantee fee rates are $0.45 per $100 of coverage for credit terms up to 90 days, and $0.90 per $100 of coverage for credit terms up to 180 days. Section 211(b)(2) of the Agricultural Trade Act of 1978, 7 U.S.C. 5641(b)(2), limits the origination fee in connection with transactions under the SCGP to no more than 1 per cent of the amount of credit to be guaranteed. There is no other legislation or regulation addressing the specific fee rates.
182. Other than the legislative restriction noted above, the CCC sets and changes the fee rates as it deems appropriate. For example, fee rates for the SCGP were changed in US fiscal year 2000 (beginning 1 October 1999) and set at their current level. Prior to that time, the fee rate was $0.95 per

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-120
$100 of coverage regardless of the repayment period. The fee rates were changed to give exporters and importers an incentive to negotiate repayment terms of less than 180 days. Legislative amendment is not required to change the fee rates unless the rates for the SCGP are to exceed 1 per cent of the guaranteed dollar value of a transaction. It is not necessary to amend the programme regulations in order to change the fee rates.
183. CCC carries out a country risk assessment for each country prior to announcing its eligibility for SCGP participation. Country risk assessment entails a review of the economic and political situation in each country to ensure there is a reasonable expectation that the country's importers will be able to repay debts incurred under the programme. CCC does not determine the creditworthiness of importers participating in the SCGP. CCC provides a guarantee covering 65 per cent of the export transactions under the programme; the exporter or his assignee (US bank) must accept the remaining 35 per cent of the transaction's risk. This "risk sharing" between CCC and the exporter/assignee is intended to ensure that due diligence is performed in assessing an importer's creditworthiness before undertaking a transaction with that importer.
86. Is there a risk categorization in relation to three export credit guarantee programmes (GSM-102, GSM-103 and SCGP)? Does this have any impact on premiums payable and the ability of the CCC to on-sell the guarantees ? USA
184. All countries eligible for any of the CCC export credit guarantee programmes are categorized according to risk. CCC categorization of countries is based on a US government internal risk classification system. This system is administratively controlled and may not be released outside of the US Government. A country's risk classification has no impact on the premiums payable under the US export credit guarantee programmes. There is no secondary market for CCC guarantees; therefore, CCC does not "on-sell" the guarantees.
87. What proportion of CCC (export-related and total) long term operating costs and losses are represented by GSM-102, GSM-103 and SCGP programmes? USA
185. With the advent of the Credit Reform Act, the export guarantee programmes are not financed out of the Commodity Credit Corporation. While the programmes continue to be run through the authorities and facilities of the CCC, all budget authority (funding) for the guarantee programmes is provided directly to accounts for those programmes from the US Treasury.
88. (a) Is the Panel correct in understanding that the United States' argument is that, at present, by virtue of Article 10.2 of the Agreement on Agriculture, there are no disciplines on agricultural export credit guarantees under the Agreement on Agriculture (or the SCM Agreement)? USA
186. Article 10.2 provides: "Members undertake to work toward the development of internationally agreed disciplines to govern the provision of export credits, export credit guarantees or insurance programmes and, after agreement on such disciplines to provide export credits, export credit guarantees or insurance programmes only in conformity therewith." Article 10.2 imposes an obligation on Members to work toward "internationally agreed disciplines" and, upon agreement on such disciplines, to provide export credit guarantees only in conformity with such disciplines. This was the purpose of the negotiations in the OECD that followed the Uruguay Round, and which now are occurring under the aegis of the WTO. If and when such disciplines are agreed upon, they are WTO obligations under the Agreement on Agriculture.82
82This is similar to other work programs that continued beyond the close of the Uruguay Round. See US First Written Submission, paras. 154-66.

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-121
187. Brazil's argument is that such "internationally agreed disciplines" already apply. If export credit guarantee programmes were already subject to export subsidy disciplines, then Article 10.2 would be unnecessary. That is, Members would already have "to provide . . . export credit guarantees . . . only in conformity" with the internationally agreed disciplines of the WTO. In Brazil's oral statement, Brazil attempts to avoid this implication of its reading by repeatedly attempting to insert the word "specific" into the text of Article 10.2 ­ that is, "undertake to work toward the development of specific internationally agreed disciplines ."83 That word is not there, however. The United States' interpretation of Article 10.2 gives meaning to the text of Article 10.2 as drafted and agreed by Members whereas Brazil's reading would effectively read it out of the Agreement on Agriculture.
(b) Does the United States agree with the following proposition: a WTO Member may therefore extend agricultural export credit guarantees without charging a premium, and for an indefinite period, in addition to any other terms and conditions it may wish? How would this reconcile with the title of Article 10 of the Agreement on Agriculture ("Prevention of Circumvention on Export Subsidy Commitments"), and with other commitments contained in the Agreement on Agriculture? Please cite any relevant material, including any past WTO dispute settlement cases. How would this reconcile with the United States' own statement, at paragraph 21 of its closing oral statement that "of course, the United States may not provide subsidies without any limit". USA
188. Article 10.2 applies only to export credit guarantees (and export credits and insurance programmes) properly characterized as such. In the case of the United States, export credit guarantees are offered pursuant to programmes which charge premiums; impose limits on tenor; impose limits on exposure to individual bank obligations; impose limits on exposure to risk of default from different countries; define shipping periods; and issue allocations (value limitations) of potential guarantee availability for specific commodities to be exported to specific destinations. The United States also guarantees only a relatively small portion of interest. Consequently, participants remain exposed to a significant component of the over-all risk of default.
189. The United States submits that the deferral of disciplines under Article 10.2 properly applies to export credit guarantees offered pursuant to a programme with such characteristics; indeed, Brazil has not contested that US export credit guarantee programmes are encompassed by the terms of Article 10.2. Illegitimate attempts to characterize export subsidy programmes as export credit guarantee programmes would be subject to the anti-circumvention provisions of Article 10.1 and the other commitments of the Agreement on Agriculture.84
190. The US interpretation of Article 10.2 presents no conflict with the title of Article 10, which provides relevant context in interpreting the provisions of Article 10. Article 10 is entitled "Prevention of Circumvention on Export Subsidy Commitments." Article 10.2 contributes to the prevention of circumvention of export subsidy commitments by imposing two obligations on Members: first, they must undertake to work toward the development of internally agreed disciplines
83See, e.g., Brazil's Oral Statement, para. 100 ("Article 10.2 instead announces Members' intent to work toward negotiations on specific disciplines for export credits.") (italics in original); id. ("In the meantime, while those specific disciplines are being discussed . . .") (emphasis added); id., para. 102 ("Under the first part of Article 10.2, therefore, WTO Members have pledged to work toward the development of specific disciplines . . . .") (emphasis added); id., para. 103 ("If Members do conclude an agreement on these specific disciplines . . . .") (emphasis added); id. (Brazil and the United States agree that there has been no agreement on any such specific disciplines . . . .") (emphasis added).
84For example, the United States could not simply change the name of the FSC Repeal and Extraterritorial Income Exclusion Act to the "FSC Repeal and Extraterritorial Income Exclusion Export Credit Guarantee Program" and successfully assert that the deferral of disciplines contemplated by Article 10.2 applies to such re-named program.

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-122
on export credit guarantees; second, "after agreement on such disciplines," they must provide export credit guarantees "only in conformity therewith". Thus, Members agreed that those internationally agreed disciplines would constrain the provision of export credit guarantees, which in turn would contribute to the goal of Article 10, to prevent the circumvention of export subsidy commitments.
191. Although the language quoted from paragraph 21 of the United States' closing oral statement was intended to address concerns involving domestic support for upland cotton,85 it also applies in the case of export subsidies. The United States also cannot provide export subsidies without limit. It has a schedule of export subsidy reduction commitments for 12 commodities. For these commodities, export subsidies can only be provided in accordance with such schedule. For the remainder of agricultural commodities, the United States cannot provide export subsidies at all.
192. Although internationally agreed disciplines on export credit guarantee programmes have yet to be agreed, the characteristics of such programmes and the discipline inherent in the risk-sharing aspects of such programmes impose an internal constraint on their use. Indeed, the use of US export credit guarantee programmes has declined since the period before the inception of Uruguay Round commitments. As shown in the US answer to Question 82(b), the dollar value of guarantees provided by the United States in US fiscal year 1992 was $5,671.8 million, in fiscal year 1993 was $3,853.7 million, and in fiscal year 1994 was $3,177.4 million. In contrast, the average value of guarantees for fiscal years 1995 - 2002 was only $3,061.9 million. Any concerns about unchecked use of export credit guarantee programmes, then, are not supported by the post-Uruguay Round experience.
(c) If, as the United States argues, there are no disciplines on export credit guarantees in the Agreement on Agriculture, how could export credit guarantees "conform fully to the provisions of Part V" of the Agreement on Agriculture within the meaning of Article 13 (how can you assess "conformity" or non-conformity when there are allegedly no disciplines against which such an assessment could occur)? USA
193. US export credit guarantee programmes provide "export credit guarantees" within the meaning of Article 10.2 and therefore will be subject to disciplines only as contemplated by that Article. Because no such disciplines currently exist, these programmes cannot be out of compliance with Part V of the Agriculture Agreement. Moreover, export credit guarantees are not export subsidies within the meaning of either Article 9.1 or 10.1, and since they are not export subsidies, Article 13(c) does not apply to them.
(d) Is the United States advocating the view that its own export credit guarantee programmes, which pre-dated the Uruguay Round, are effectively "grandfathered" so as to benefit from some sort of exemption from the export subsidy disciplines of the Agreement on Agriculture? How, if at all, is it relevant that the SCGP did not, according to the United States, become relevant for upland cotton until the late 1990's (i.e. after the entry into force of the WTO Agreement)? USA
194. It is not entirely clear what is meant by the term "grandfathering" in this connection. Agriculture Agreement Article 10.2 defers the imposition of disciplines on export credits, export
85The statement itself was intended to note that the United States is subject to the limit set forth in its domestic support reduction commitments for the Current Total Aggregate Measurement of Support. This amount, across all US commodities, is $19.1 billion. In addition, a very specific limit applies with respect to domestic support for upland cotton under the Peace Clause. It may not exceed the rate of 72.9 cents per pound, as decided in 1992, without removing the Peace Clause protection of Article 13 of the Agreement of Agriculture.

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-123
credit guarantees, and insurance programmes until internationally agreed disciplines are reached, and in that sense the export subsidy disciplines of the Agreement do not apply to the export credit guarantee programmes at issue in this dispute.
195. The SCGP began in 1996, and no transactions occurred under this programme in connection with cotton until fiscal year 1998, which began in September 1997. Although the negotiators obviously could not have considered the application of this specific programme, it is substantially similar in its operation to other US export credit guarantee programmes. Again, Brazil has not contested that SCGP provides export credit guarantees within the meaning of Article 10.2. Thus, the deferral of disciplines under Article 10.2 similarly applies.
STEP 2 PAYMENTS
89. Does the United States confirm Brazil's statement in paragraph 331 of its first submission that "The conditions and requirements for Step 2 domestic payments remain unchanged with the passage of the 2002 FSRI Act"? What is the relevance of this, if any, to this dispute? USA
196. While the Step 2 programme under the 2002 Act is largely consistent with the programme under the 1996 Act, there have been some modifications since the inception of the programme, relating to the precise nature of the price differential formula and the price ceiling for the Step 2 payments. The 2002 programme was unchanged from the 1996 Act programme, as amended, except for suspending the 1.25 cent differential. In the end, this is inconsequential because it does not materially affect the levels of support decided in marketing year 1992 (72.9 cents per pound) or that measures currently grant (52 cents per pound).
90. Does the United States confirm Brazil's statement in paragraph 235 of its first submission that the changes concerning Step 2 export payments from the 1996 FAIR Act to the 2002 FSRI Act are: increase in the amount of the subsidy by 1.25 cents per pound and the removal of any budgetary limits that applied under the 1996 FAIR Act? What is the relevance of this, if any, to this dispute? USA
197. As noted in the US answer to Question 89, the 2002 Act suspended the 1.25 cents differential, but the United States disagrees with the assertion of increased budgetary exposure for the programme. First, we note that Step 2 for the 1992 crop and marketing years was covered by the provisions of the 1990 Act, which had no limit on the amount of expense that could be undertaken in Step 2. For the 1996 Act, which covered the 1996-2002 crops until supplanted by the 2002 Act, there was a limit of $701 million for the six-year duration of the Act, and in fact that money did run out in December 1998. However, the Congress removed the budgetary limit of the 1996 Act as of October 1999 (Public Law No. 106-78, 22 Oct. 1999). Therefore, neither the 2002 Act, nor the 1996 Act (as of October 1999), nor the 1990 Act had budgetary limits on Step 2 expenditures.
198. While the potential step 2 payment (when price conditions in the statute are met) is higher in the 2002 Act than under the 1996 Act by as much as (but not more than) 1.25 cents per pound, step 2 merely changes the vehicle of support.
91. What is the significance of the elimination of the 1.25 cent threshold payment in the 2002 FSRI Act pertaining to Step 2 payments? USA
199. Please see the US answers to Question 89, 90, and 117.
92. Does the United States confirm that Exhibit BRA-65 represents a sample contract for exporters of eligible upland cotton to conclude with the CCC under the FSRI 2002, and that an application form (Exhibit BRA-66) needs to be filled out with data on weekly

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-124
exports and submitted to the USDA FAS. Is Exhibit BRA-66 - Form CCC 1045-2 - also a valid example? If not, please identify any differences or distinctions. USA
200. The Brazilian exhibits appear to be accurate versions of old Step 2 programme documents. Some of the documents in the exhibit are for domestic handlers and involved programme payment assignments. We also note that, in making an export claim, other documentation like bills of lading may be needed.
201. The official documents for the upland cotton step 2 programme can be found at the Farm Services Agency website (www.fsa.usda.gov/daco, click on "cotton" and on "upland cotton user marketing certificate programme".) There is a common contract that exists for both domestic users and exports under the Step 2 programme, CCC Form CCC-1045UP. Because of the different nature of uses and therefore applications, there are separate reporting forms: CCC-1045UP-1 for domestic users and CCC-1045UP-2 for Exporter Users. Recently updated documents used for this programme are attached as Exhibit US-21.
93. Please elaborate why the United States deems that Step 2 payments upon submission of proof of export are not subsidies contingent upon export. Is it the US contention that, in order to be contingent on export, exportation must be the exclusive condition for receipt of the payment? USA
202. As the United States has indicated, all upland cotton produced in the United States is eligible for the benefit of the Step 2 cotton subsidy. If the statutory price condition applies, all US upland cotton used during the applicable period of time will received the subsidy. "Use" in domestic manufacture or export constitutes the universe of potential use of US upland cotton. The United States submits that when the entirety of production of a good in a country is eligible to receive a subsidy, no contingency on export exists. The Step 2 subsidy is entirely distinct in this regard from a hypothetical situation in which a subsidy is theoretically available for domestic use, but in reality is exclusively or nearly exclusively available in connection with exports.
95. Do the criteria in 7 CFR 1427.103(c)(2) (Exhibit BRA-37) that Step 2 "eligible upland cotton" must be "not imported cotton" apply to both domestic and export payments? USA
203. Only domestic cotton is eligible for Step 2 payment, which is made if the statutory price conditions are met and requisite proof of use is submitted.
96. Is a domestic sale a "use" for the purposes of Step 2 payments? Is a sale for export, or export, considered a "use"? USA
204. A sale is not a use for purposes of the Step 2 subsidy. For domestic manufacture, opening the cotton bale constitutes use. For exports, similarly, the sale alone does not itself constitute use; the exporter must demonstrate actual exportation.86
97. How does the United States respond to Brazil's assertion, at paragraph 70 of Brazil's oral statement at the first session of the first substantive meeting, that "It is obvious that a single bale of cotton cannot be both exported and used domestically." Is this a relevant consideration? USA
205. It is unclear what Brazil's assertion is intended to demonstrate. The Step 2 programme makes payments to documented users of US upland cotton. If a bale cannot be both opened domestically and exported (although it is not clear why that would be so), that amounts to arguing that a single bale
867 Code of Federal Regulations 1427.103(a).

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-125
cannot be "used" twice. The fact remains that either opening the bale domestically or exporting it ­ that is, the universe of activities resulting in use of US upland cotton ­ is entitled (given certain market conditions) to a Step 2 payment.
206. The United States notes, moreover, that it may actually be possible (economic realities aside) that the same bale could be exported and then brought back into the country and opened for domestic use. (Please see the US answer to Question 98 for more detail.) The US Department of Agriculture's position would be that the payment should be made on the bale once only. The purpose of the programme is to provide support to upland cotton farmers. Once the bale has been purchased by an upland cotton user, there would be no additional support for upland cotton farmers from providing Step 2 payments on additional "uses" of the same bale.
98. How many Step 2 payments are received if a bale of upland cotton is exported, and then opened by a domestic user in the United States, or vice versa? USA
207. If a bale were exported and then imported and opened up (or vice versa) it would be the US position that only one payment would be made. It does not appear that this situation has ever arisen in fact, but we note that the Step 2 regulations specifically provide that "imported" cotton is not eligible for payment. Such cotton may include any cotton that was imported, even if it had been produced in the United States.
99. How does the United States respond to Brazil's arguments in paragraphs 71-75 of Brazil's oral statement at the first session of the first Panel meeting concerning the relevance of the Appellate Body Report in US-FSC (21.5). USA
208. In contrast to the facts of the United States ­ FSC (21.5) dispute, in this dispute all of the product is produced in the United States; all of the product is eligible to receive the benefit of the subsidy; and all of the potential uses of the product are similarly eligible. If the statutory formula of price conditions applies, all US upland cotton used during that time ­ regardless of how such use is manifested ­ will receive the subsidy. This case involves only one factual situation: use of cotton during a particular period of time. The only factual distinction applicable here is whether the applicable price conditions are on or off. Brazil's emphasis on the "different instructions" in the programme regulations is misplaced. Such instructions are simply to demonstrate the requisite use and to assure payment is made to the proper party. If upland cotton could be used in a third or fourth way, this would not change the eligibility for subsidy but would necessitate a parallel third or fourth set of instructions to demonstrate that form of use as well.
103. Is the Step 2 programme fund a unified fund that is available for either domestic users or exporters, without a specific amount earmarked for either domestic users or exporters? Please substantiate your response, including by reference to any applicable statutory or regulatory provisions. USA
209. The upland cotton user marketing certificate programme (Step 2) makes no differentiation between funds for payments to exporters and domestic handlers ­ it is all one programme. The first paragraph of the Step 2 rule states:
These regulations set forth the terms and conditions under which CCC shall make payments, in the form of commodity certificates or cash, to eligible domestic users and exporters of upland cotton who entered into an Upland Cotton Domestic User/Exporter Agreement with CCC to participate in the upland cotton user marketing certificate
The Step 2 rule was published on 18 October 2002, at 67 Federal Register 64454, and is codified at 7 Code of Federal Regulations 1427.100-.108.

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-126

210. As with other US domestic support measures, Step 2 payments are funded through the Commodity Credit Corporation, which has a borrowing authority in the Treasury and as such does not rely on appropriations. This is provided for in Sections 1207 and 1601(a) of the 2002 Act and codified at 7 US Code 7937 and 7991.
104. How does the United States respond to the data presented in Exhibit BRA-69? Is it accurate? Please substantiate. USA
211. The data in Exhibit BRA-69 is not official US Government data, and Brazil has not indicated the source of the information. Thus, we cannot confirm its reliability. The United States has tried in any event to obtain information in the format of Bra-69, which is not maintained and published by the US Government in that manner. The following data has been collected by the US Department of Agriculture and attempts to designate (as in Bra-69) Step 2 payments by fiscal year87 and use.

A comparison with Exhibit BRA-69 suggests that the Brazilian data is inaccurate.

212. During the first panel meeting, the Panel asked about the figures shown for fiscal year 1996, which showed a zero payment for mill use and a positive number for export use. We suggested that perhaps appropriated amounts had suddenly run out, but our suggestion was not accurate. Rather, the odd numbers for fiscal year 1996 resulted because, at the time, payments for export use accrued when the contract for export was made. However, such payments were not paid until the export actually took place, at which time the exporter would be paid based on the Step 2 rates that applied when the

87The US fiscal year runs from October 1 - September 30, such that the 2002 fiscal year would run from 1 October 2001, through 30 September 2002.

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-127
contract was made. As the Panel is aware, Step 2 payments can be made only when there is a difference between world and US prices for cotton for a certain time period. In the case of fiscal year 1996, these prices did not satisfy the Step 2 conditions, but there were some payments that were made during that fiscal year because they had accrued by an export contract made in the previous fiscal year. That rule is now changed88 so that the rate that applies for export use is the rate that is in effect when the export is made not when the contract for export was made.
105. Why is the Step 2 programme separated into "domestic users" and "exporters"? Apart from differentiating between exporters and domestic users, with consequential differentiation as to the forms that must be filled out and certain other conditions that must be fulfilled, are the eligibility criteria for Step 2 payments identical? Are the form and rate of payment, as well as the actual payment made, identical? USA
213. US law does not separate the Step 2 programme into domestic users and exporters. There is but one Step 2 statute ­ codified at 7 US Code 7937 ­ and but one Step 2 rule for all users ­ found at 7 Code of Federal Regulations 1427.100-.108. The statute and rule do identify "domestic users" and "exporters" as the universe of bona fide users of upland cotton and thus potential recipients for Step 2 payments. Therefore, the only distinction drawn between these recipients is the proof of use: domestic handlers are paid when they open a bale, and exporters are paid when they export. The form and rate of payment are identical.
106. With respect to paragraph 139 of the United States' first written submission, are Step 2 export payments included in the annual reduction commitments of the United States? If so, why? USA
214. The United States does not distinguish between the uses of US upland cotton for purposes of reporting the subsidy because the subsidy is not contingent on export performance. All Step 2 payments are reported as product-specific domestic support for upland cotton and are included within the Total Aggregate Measurement of Support calculation for purposes of domestic support reduction commitments.
107. Please comment on any relevance, to Brazil's de jure claims of inconsistency with the provisions of the Agreement on Agriculture, of Exhibit BRA-69, which shows Step 2 payments made to (i) domestic users and (ii) exporters. This Exhibit shows that, from FY 91/92 through 02, the Step 2 payments for exporters exceeded those for domestic users in FY 94; FY 95; FY 96 (in fact there were no domestic payments in FY 96); and FY 02. In the other years, the domestic payments are greater than export payments. BRA, USA
215. Without commenting on the accuracy of the specific numbers set forth in Exhibit BRA-69, it is entirely possible that in certain years one type of user happened to receive a larger share of payments than another type of user. This would entirely be a function of market conditions and relative demand for manufacture or for export. That is, differences in amounts paid to exporters and domestic users during any time period are happenstance based on actual use of US upland cotton.
216. The United States notes that payments to exporters were previously made based on when exporters finalized the sale contract, not on when the cotton was actually exported. In the specific case of fiscal year 1996, it appears that payments for exported upland cotton accrued during a period when Step 2 payments were allowed by the statute, but that the payments were actually made at a time when market conditions no longer met the statutory criteria for payment. The rule has been changed,89 and that situation can no longer recur.
88See 61 Federal Register 37544, 37548 (18 July 1996). 89See 61 Federal Register 37544, 37548 (July 18, 1996).

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-128
108. At paragraph 135 of its first written submission, the United States states : "[T]he subsidy is not contingent upon export performance..." (emphasis added). Again, in the course of the first Panel meeting, the United States admitted that the Step 2 payments were "subsidies". Does the United States thus concede that Step 2 payments constitute a "subsidy" within the meaning of the WTO Agreement? USA
217. The United States has always maintained that Step 2 payments are subsidies that provide domestic support in favour of US agricultural producers.
109. How does the United States respond to Brazil's arguments concerning a mandatory/discretionary distinction and the allegation that certain United States measures (including s.1207(a) of the 2002 FSRI Act) are mandatory? (This is referred to, for example, in paragraph 28 of Brazil's first written submission). Does the United States agree with the assertion that (subject to the availability of funds) the payment by the Secretary of Step 2 payments is mandatory under section 1207(a) FSRI upon fulfilment by a domestic user or exporter of the conditions set out in the legislation and regulations? If not, then why not? To what extent is this relevant here? What determines the "availability of funds"? Please cite any other relevant measures or provisions which you consider should guide the Panel in respect of this issue. USA
218. The United States does not disagree that, subject to the availability of funds (that is, the availability of CCC borrowing authority), Step 2 payments must be made to all those who meet the conditions for eligibility. With respect to the well-accepted mandatory/discretionary distinction reflected in GATT 1947 and WTO panel and Appellate Body reports, the United States notes that the distinction is the natural consequence of the fact that there can be no presumption of bad faith in WTO dispute settlement, a fact that numerous Members, including the European Communities, have emphasized.90 Thus, to the extent that a Member retains discretion under a measure to act in accordance with a WTO obligation, it may not be presumed that the Member will violate that obligation, or to conclude that the measure itself ­ separately from the measure's application in a specific instance ­ may be found inconsistent with that obligation.
110. Section 1207(a) of the 2002 FSRI Act provides that during the period beginning on the date of the enactment of the FSRI Act through July 31 2008, " .. the Secretary shall issue marketing certificates or cash payments, at the option of the recipient, to domestic users and exporters for documented purchases by domestic users and sales for export by exporters...". The Panel notes that Brazil does not appear to distinguish between the treatment of (i) cash payments and (ii) marketing certificates in terms of the issue of whether or not a "subsidy" exists. The United States refers to "benefits" and "payments" and "programme" in asserting that Step 2 is not export contingent (paragraphs 127-135 of the United States' first written submission).
(a) Do the parties thus agree that there is no need to draw any distinction between the treatment of (i) cash payments and (ii) marketing certificates in terms of the issue of whether or not a "subsidy" exists for the purposes of the Agreement on Agriculture? BRA, USA
219. The United States agrees that there is no need to draw a distinction between cash payments and marketing certificates in terms of whether a subsidy exists for purposes of the Agreement on Agriculture.
90See Appellate Body Report, United States - Section 211 Omnibus Appropriations Act of 1998, WT/DS176/AB/R, adopted 1 February 2002, para. 259.

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-129
(b) Why would a domestic user or an exporter select to receive a marketing certificate over a cash payment? What is the proportion of cash payments vs. marketing certificates granted under the programme? USA
220. A user of upland cotton that elects to receive payment in the form of a marketing certificate is entitled to redeem that certificate for an equivalent amount of upland cotton held by the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC). Although authorized by statute, no Step 2 payments have been made in recent times in the form of certificates. Marketing certificates in lieu of cash payments for Step 2 were last used heavily in the early to mid-1990s. The CCC does not currently maintain high upland cotton inventories from which such certificates if issued could be redeemed.
111. Does the United States maintain its argument that actions based on Article 3.1(b) of the SCM Agreement are conditionally "exempt from actions" due to the operation of Article 13 of the Agreement on Agriculture? USA
221. Article 13(c) provides that "export subsidies that conform fully to the provisions of Part V of this Agreement, as reflected in each Member's Schedule, shall be . . . exempt from actions based on Article XVI of GATT 1994 or Articles 3, 5 and 6 of the Subsidies Agreement." Article 13(b), which applies to domestic support measures, does not reference Subsidies Agreement Article 3. Brazil has advanced claims under Article 3.1(b) of the Subsidies Agreement only with respect to Step 2 payments, which are domestic support measures and not export subsidies. Thus, on the US view the Peace Clause would not appear to be applicable; however, to the extent Brazil asserts that Step 2 payments (or some part thereof) are export subsidies, Article 13(c) would be relevant.
222. We also note that paragraph 7 of Annex 3 requires that support in favour of domestic agricultural producers that is provided through payment to processors shall be included in the AMS of the Member. If payments are made in connection with both domestic and foreign product then such payments are not support in favour of domestic agricultural producers. Consequently, the Agriculture Agreement necessarily contemplates that support paid to processors may be paid solely with respect to domestic production. Under Article 6.3 of the Agriculture Agreement, if a Member is providing support within its domestic support reduction commitments, then such support may not be challenged under Article 3.1(b) because that Article applies "[e]xcept as provided in the Agreement on Agriculture". If a Member exceeds its domestic support reduction commitments, on the other hand, then such support paid to processors would be actionable under Article 3.1(b).
112. In the event that the Panel finds that Article 6.3 of the Agreement on Agriculture does not preclude an examination of Brazil's claims under Article 3.1 of the SCM Agreement and Article III:4 of GATT 1994, how does the United States respond to the merits of Brazil's claims relating to Step 2 payments under those provisions? USA
223. As indicated in the US answer to Question 111 from the Panel, and as the European Communities has noted in its third party submission, inasmuch as paragraph 7 of Annex 3 of the Agreement on Agriculture requires support in favour of agricultural producers that is paid to processors to be included in the Member's Aggregate Measurement of Support, then the Agreement on Agriculture necessarily contemplates that such payments to processors may apply solely with respect to domestic product. Otherwise, as in the case of Step 2 payments, domestic cotton producers would not receive the relative price benefit conferred by the payment. Consequently, such discrimination in favour of domestic production is permitted under the Agreement on Agriculture and, under Article 21.1 of that Agreement, the provisions of GATT 1994 and of other Multilateral Trade Agreements in Annex 1A to the WTO Agreement are expressly "subject to the provisions of [the Agriculture] Agreement." For that reason, neither Article 3.1(b) of the Subsidies Agreement nor GATT 1994 Article III:4 precludes such payments to users of US upland cotton, unless the United States exceeds its domestic support reduction commitments.

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-130
113. Is it necessary for measures directed at agricultural processors included in AMS to discriminate on the basis of the origin of goods? USA
224. The United States does not express an opinion whether it is necessary in all circumstances for all Members with respect to all commodities. However, paragraph 7 of Annex 3 of the Agreement on Agriculture certainly contemplates that support in favour of domestic producers provided by payments to processors is included in the Aggregate Measurement of Support. In the case of Step 2 payments on upland cotton, if payments were provided in favour of all upland cotton, whether domestic or foreign, used by domestics mills or exporters, the price benefit for US producers would not be achieved. Without such a benefit to US producers, these payments would not need to be included in the Aggregate Measurement of Support. The Agreement on Agriculture does not preclude payments that solely benefit domestic producers; indeed, paragraph 7 contemplates such discriminatory subsidy payments. Accordingly, the United States reports all Step 2 payments as domestic support in favour of US producers of upland cotton.
115. What is the meaning and relevance (if any) to Brazil's claims under Article 3 of the SCM Agreement and Article III:4 of GATT 1994 of the phrase "measures directed at agricultural processors shall be included to the extent that such measures benefit the producers of the basic agricultural products" in the Agreement on Agriculture? BRA, USA
225. The United States directs the Panel's attention to the US answers to Questions 111, 112, and 113 from the Panel.
116. With respect to paragraph 32 of the oral statement of the EC, are subsidies contingent on the use of domestic goods consistent with the Agreement on Agriculture? Does the phrase "provide support in favour of domestic producers" in Article 3.2 of the Agreement on Agriculture refer to, and/or permit such subsidies? BRA, USA
226. Subsidies contingent on the use of domestic goods may be consistent with the Agreement on Agriculture. Paragraph 7 of Annex 3 of the Agreement requires the United States to include its Step 2 payments in favour of domestic upland cotton producers, even though such payments are made to processors, within its calculation of its Aggregate Measurement of Support. The United States has complied with its domestic support reduction commitments. Therefore, Step 2 payments to upland cotton users that provide support to domestic producers contingent on the use of domestic goods is consistent with the Agreement on Agriculture. If Members could not discriminate in favour of domestic producers when making subsidy payments through processors, there would be no reason for paragraph 7 of Annex 3. Such payments that are not limited to domestic products would not be in favour of domestic producers because the relative economic benefit of the subsidy vis-à-vis foreign production would not exist.
117. What is the relationship between Step 2 payments to exporters and the marketing loan payments, both of which appear to compensate for the price differences relative to the Liverpool A-Index? For example, is there double compensation? Or is one of the explanations that these export-related price compensatory payments are paid to different operators (namely, the producer, on the one hand under the marketing loan arrangements, and the processor/users (Step 2 programme) arrangements on the other? USA
227. Both marketing loan payments and Step 2 payments are domestic support for upland cotton, but the marketing loan payment is made directly to the producer whereas the Step 2 payment is made to users of the cotton. The marketing loan repayment formula, in section 1204 of the 2002 Act, and the Step 2 payment formula in section 1207 of the 2002 Act, differ by their terms and are simply

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-131
different forms of support, the latter (Step 2) being a form of support that can facilitate higher market prices for US cotton. We will address this more fully in our rebuttal submission.
118. Can the United States confirm that it does not rely on Article III:8 of GATT 1994? USA
228. The United States can confirm that the Step 2 payment is not made exclusively to domestic producers.
ETI ACT
119. How does the United States respond to Brazil's reference to the panel report in India Patents (EC) (at paragraph 138 of its oral statement at the first session of the first substantive meeting)? How, if at all, should the Panel take this report into account in considering the issues raised by Brazil's claims relating to the ETI Act? USA
229. We agree with the passage quoted from the India ­ Patents dispute and consider it relevant to the extent that: Brazil has identified the challenged measure; Brazil has argued why the reasoning of the panels and Appellate Body are relevant in determining that the measure is inconsistent; and the Panel finds the reasoning in FSC/ETI persuasive. Our argument in the first written submission went to whether Brazil had carried its burden of bringing a prima facie case, in order to assist the Panel to fulfill its obligation under DSU Article 11 to make an objective assessment of the matter before it. Brazil may consider that it should not have to meet this burden, but under DSU rules as currently agreed, it must.91 Finally, we note our statement in the first submission that "[w]hile the United States cannot specify the precise date on which this will occur, the United States is confident that the ETI Act will be repealed in the reasonably near future."92
121. How do you respond to the reference in paragraph 43 of EC third party oral statement with respect to the relevance of Article 17.14 of the DSU, and, in particular, the phrase "a final resolution to that dispute" (emphasis added)? Please explain the use, and relevance (if any) of the term "disputes" in Articles 9.3 and 12 and Appendix 3 of the DSU, and please cite any other provisions you consider relevant. USA, BRA
230. The United States considers the EC's references to be irrelevant to the resolution of this dispute. As noted in the US first written submission, the United States intends to implement the DSB's recommendations and rulings in the FSC/ETI dispute. Further, the issues raised in the US first written submission related solely to whether Brazil had met its burden of argumentation in this dispute and not to the substantive correctness and applicability, or lack thereof, of the adopted findings in FSC/ETI. Nor did the US arguments relate to the breadth of the US obligation to implement the DSB's rulings and recommendations in that dispute. The United States considers that Brazil's burden in this dispute requires, at a minimum, that it identify those aspects of the measure which are WTOconsistent and explain why that is the case.
91See TN/DS/W/45 (Brazilian proposal in ongoing DSU review: "Brazil understands that one of the drawbacks of the current dispute settlement mechanism is the necessity for a Member to litigate a case de novo through all the established phases even if the same measure nullifying or impairing benefits of this Member has already been found WTO inconsistent in previous panel or appeal proceedings initiated by another Member.").

I. PRELIMINARY ISSUES
(3) If the request for consultations in this dispute omitted certain products in relation to export credit guarantees, on what basis is it argued that it failed to identify the measures at issue in accordance with Article 4.4 of the DSU?
Brazil's Comment on US Answer:
1. In paragraphs 5-6 of its 11 August Answer to Question 3, the United States argues that footnote 1 to Brazil's request for consultations does not expand the scope of the request, with regard to the US export credit guarantee programmes, beyond upland cotton. This is inaccurate. The footnote number falls immediately after the words "upland cotton" in the first sentence of the first paragraph of the request. With reference to "upland cotton", the footnote reads, "[e]xcept with respect to export credit guarantee programmes as explained below".1 Although the United States claims that there is no explanation "below", there is indeed such an explanation. In particular, Brazil described its potential claim as follows, on page 4 of the request:
Regarding export credit guarantees, export and market access enhancement provided under the Agricultural Trade Act of 1978, as amended, and other measures such as GSM-102, GSM-103, and SCGP programmes, Brazil is of the view that these programmes, as applied and as such, violate Articles 3.3, 8, 9.1, and 10.1 of the Agreement on Agriculture and are prohibited export subsidies under Article 3.1(a) and item (j) of the Illustrative List of Export Subsidies included in Annex I to the SCM Agreement.2
The Panel will note that there is no limitation in this sentence to any particular commodity or commodities.
2. At paragraph 7 of its 11 August Answer, the United States asserts that "the statement of evidence attached to Brazil's consultation request did not include any evidence related to measures other than those for upland cotton." This too is inaccurate. The United States conveniently leaves the word "available" out of the term "statement of available evidence" used in Articles 4.2 and 7.2 of the SCM Agreement. Brazil was required to provide a statement of the evidence available to it at the time. It was not required to attach exhibits with the evidence; nor was it required to provide a statement regarding all of the evidence that it would eventually present to this Panel. In paragraph 3 of its statement of available evidence, Brazil addressed what it knew at that point about the US export credit guarantee programmes:
US export credit guarantee programmes, since their origin in 1980 and up [to] the present, provide premium rates that are inadequate to cover the long-term operating costs and losses of the programmes; in particular there were losses caused by large-scale defaults totaling billions of dollars that have not been reflected in increased premiums to cover such losses.
3. This sentence speaks not just to the existence of the US export credit guarantee programmes, but also to the way in which they constitute export subsidies, given the explicit use of the language included in item (j) of the Illustrative List of Export Subsidies. The statement fulfils the requirement in Articles 4.2 and 7.2 of the SCM Agreement. The Panel will also note that there is no limitation in this sentence to any particular commodity or commodities.
4. In footnote 3 to its response, the United States states that it "will be making a request for a preliminary ruling" that Brazil's consultation request was broader than its statement of evidence, in
1 WT/DS/267/1, p. 1. 2 WT/DS/267/1, p. 4.

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-137
violation of Article 7.2.3 As demonstrated above, Brazil's request, and the accompanying statement of available evidence, do not support the United States' assertion. Both the request and the statement of available evidence address the US export credit guarantee programmes without limitation to any particular commodity or commodities.
5. Moreover, even if the United States were to make this request for a preliminary ruling and the Panel were to grant it, it would not affect Brazil's claims. Brazil's compliance with Article 7.2 of the SCM Agreement can have no effect on its claims under the Agreement on Agriculture, or on its prohibited subsidy claims under the SCM Agreement, or on its actionable subsidy claims with respect to upland cotton.
6. Finally, according to the Panel's Working Procedures, requests for preliminary rulings by a party were to have been made "not later than its first submission to the Panel".4 Thus, the US request would not be timely. Brazil submits this information at this stage in the hope of avoiding another lengthy procedural objection by the United States.
(4) Is it argued that the export credit guarantee programmes concerning upland cotton are each a separate or independent measure, in that they operate independently?
Brazil's Comment on US Answer:
7. In paragraph 11 of its 11 August Answer to Question 4, the United States argues that "each export credit guarantee issued is a separate measure". It is not for the United States to define the measures that are the subject of Brazil's challenge. Brazil's requests for consultations and establishment identify the measures at issue as the GSM 102, GSM 103 and SCGP programs, both as such and as applied. In its submissions, Brazil has demonstrated that the programmes constitute export subsidies under Articles 1.1 and 3.1(a) of the SCM Agreement, since they are unique financing vehicles that are not available on the market for agricultural commodity transactions and as such provide something better than is available on the market. Brazil has also demonstrated that the longterm operating costs and losses for the programs outpace premiums collected, under item (j) of the Illustrative List (item (j) speaks to the long-term operating costs and losses of "programmes," and not individual guarantees).
(8) Does the United States confirm that the questions referred to by Brazil in paragraph 92 of Brazil's oral statement were posed to the United States in the consultations?
Brazil's Comment on US Answer:
8. In paragraph 17 of its 11 August Answer, the United States concedes that Brazil posed the questions included at Exhibit Bra-101. The Panel will note that many of the questions included in Section 9 of Brazil's list of questions cover export credit guarantees for all commodities. The United States therefore concedes that Brazil consulted with it on the matters raised in those questions. As Brazil discussed in paragraphs 95-98 of its Statement at the First Meeting of the Panel, panels and the Appellate Body have concluded that for a matter to be properly within the scope of a request for establishment, actual consultations must have been held. That has also been the United States' position in a number of other disputes, including US ­ DRAMS and Japan ­ Agricultural Products.5
9. The refusal of the United States to answer Brazil's questions cannot hinder Brazil's ability to pursue its claims against the CCC export guarantee programmes without any limitation to a particular

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-138
commodity or commodities. If it did, responding Members would have every incentive to refuse to answer any questions during consultations, thereby halting dispute settlement proceedings altogether.
(10) What actual prejudice, if any, has the United States suffered as a result of the alleged omission of products other than upland cotton from the request for consultations?
Brazil's Comment on US Answer:
10. Brazil agrees that "a Member cannot proceed to a panel unless the Member has consulted on that measure", as the United States argues in paragraph 19 of its response. Brazil's request for consultations included the CCC export guarantee programmes in connection with all commodities, however, and the United States concedes, in paragraph 17 of its answer to Question 8, that it consulted with Brazil via the list of questions included in Exhibit Bra-101.
11. Brazil does not agree with the United States' assertion, at paragraph 20 of its 11 August Answer, that the consultation request is of a "jurisdictional nature". While the Appellate Body has concluded that a complaining Member's request for establishment is jurisdictional in nature, and strictly delimits a panel's terms of reference6, it has not made this statement with respect to a request for consultations. In fact, in Brazil ­ Aircraft, the Appellate Body concluded that there is no requirement for a "precise and exact identity" between a request for consultations and a request for establishment, which suggests that a request for consultations is not jurisdictional in nature.7
12. In paragraph 23 of its 11 August Answer, the United States argues, without any proof, that it "has suffered an inability to prepare, respond, and consult with respect to allegations on measures never presented to the United States in accordance with the DSU". As noted above, Brazil's request for consultations specifically addressed potential claims against the US export credit guarantee programs in connection with all commodities, and not just upland cotton. Moreover, the United States acknowledges that Brazil posed questions to it regarding those programmes in connection with all commodities. The questions were provided to the United States in writing on 22 November, in advance of the consultations session.8 In paragraph 92 of its Oral Statement at the First Meeting of the Panel, Brazil offered extracts from those questions, which clarify that consultations regarding the US export credit guarantee programs were not limited to upland cotton.
13. The United States, therefore, was aware, both from Brazil's request for consultations and from Brazil's extensive list of questions, that the consultations included US export credit guarantee programs with respect to all commodities, and not just upland cotton. That the United States refused to respond to Brazil's questions does not mean that it had an "inability" to prepare, respond, and consult with Brazil ­ it means that the United States made a strategic decision not to do so. The United States had more than seven months from receipt of Brazil's questions until it filed its First Submission to "prepare and respond" to Brazil's claims. This demonstrates that no due process rights were violated nor any prejudice caused. The United States alone bears responsibility for any alleged "prejudice" it has suffered as a result of its own strategic decision.
14. In paragraph 24 of its 11 August Answer, the United States argues that it "has not had [sic] proper opportunity to consult" with Brazil on the US export credit guarantee programs with respect to all commodities. In paragraph 17 of its 11 August Answer to Question 8, however, the United States concedes that Brazil did pose questions on the US export credit guarantee programmes with respect to all commodities. Consultations did, therefore, occur with respect to export credit guarantees covering all eligible agricultural products. The United States refused during meetings on 3-4 December, 19 December 2002 and 17 January 2003 to provide answers to Brazil's questions. With its

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-139
consultations request and its extensive list of questions, however, Brazil fulfilled the requirement to consult with the United States on the full scope of the programmes.
(11) Does the United States agree that Brazil's request for establishment of the Panel can be understood to indicate that Brazil's export credit guarantee claims relates to products other than upland cotton? How, if at all, is this relevant?
Brazil's Comment on US Answer:
15. At paragraphs 96-97 of its Statement at the First Panel Meeting, Brazil noted that in other disputes, the US position has been that "`a Member should be permitted to refer a claim to a panel if it was actually raised during consultations, even though it may not have been included in the written request for consultations.'"9 In its 11 August Answer to Question 11, the United States now suggests that its position is different with respect to measures than it is with respect to claims. According to the United States, while a Member can add claims not present in its consultations request to its panel request, it cannot add measures.10
16. Brazil repeats that its request for consultations does in fact address the US measures (the GSM 102, GSM 103 and SCGP programs) in connection with all commodities. Every measure included in its request for establishment was similarly included in its request for consultations. The US argument is therefore irrelevant.
17. In any event, the US reliance on the Appellate Body's decision in Guatemala ­ Cement (I) is misplaced.11 In that case, the Appellate Body explained that the text of Article 6 of the DSU and Article 17.4 of the Anti-Dumping Agreement required a distinction between measures and claims. The United States has, however, failed to explain the textual reason why the distinction between measures and claims is relevant for the purpose of comparing a request for consultations with a request for establishment. In fact, the Appellate Body has specifically held that Articles 4 and 6 of the DSU do not "require a precise and exact identity between the specific measures that were the subject of consultations and the specific measures identified in the request for the establishment of a panel".12 Nor has the United States offered any logical reason why a Member should be allowed to add claims not covered by its consultations request to its request for establishment, but not measures. If anything, a defending Member would seem to suffer greater prejudice by the addition of claims than by the addition of measures, since the Member is likely more familiar with its own measures than it would be with another Member's claims.
(16) What, if any, prejudice in terms of presentation of its case does the United States allege, should the Panel proceed to consider the measures constituting the cottonseed payments under the Agriculture Assistance Act of 2003?
Brazil's Comment on US Answer:
18. There have been many disputes in which Panel found that measures, which were replacement measures to measures originally consulted on, were included in the panel's terms of reference, Korea ­ Beef13 and Chile- Agricultural Products (Price Band)14, to name a few. The Agricultural Assistance Act of 2003 is in the nature of a revised measure, as Brazil has argued in paragraphs 145-150 of its
9 Panel Report, US ­ DRAMS, WT/DS99/R, para. 6.8. 10 US 11 August Answer to Question 11, para. 25. 11 US 11 August Answer to Question 11, para. 26 note 9 12 Appellate Body Report, Brazil ­ Aircraft, WT/DS46/AB/R, para. 132. 13 Panel Report, Korea ­ Beef, WT/DS161/R and WT/DS169/R, para. 563-564. 14 Appellate Body Report, Chile ­ Agricultural Products (Price Band), WT/DS207/AB/R, para. 143144.

Oral Statement. Brazil also notes that the United States has identified no prejudice to its ability to defend this measure in this dispute.

(17) (a)

What is the relationship of the Agricultural Assistance Act of 2003 to other legislation in the request for establishment of the Panel?

(b) Do the legal instruments follow directly one after another, or are there temporal gaps? Are payments authorized under a broad legislative authority or are they specific to each legal instrument?

(c) Please provide any implementing regulations. Do these implementing regulations resemble those relating to previous programmes or payments? Are payments made retrospectively? How if at all is this relevant?

Brazil's Comment on US Answer

19. The United States argues that the four legislative acts that authorize cottonseed payments for
the MY 1999, 2000 and 2002 crop are completely unrelated measures and that ­ while the regulations
implementing these payments are very similar ­ this is immaterial to the question of whether such payments are part of a single programme.15

20. If a Member like Brazil would be prevented from challenging yearly renewed measures that provide support under the very same mechanism ­ and in fact under nearly identical regulations16 ­
than another Member like the United States could continue to enact yearly measures and limit the
challenge by WTO Members to old measures without a prevailing challenge having any effect on its
current and future identical measures. The result would put a complaining Member in the impossible
situation of having to challenge identical measures year after year, just because they are based on legislation that "bears no relation"17 to preceding identical legislation on the same matter.

21. The Panel in Argentina ­ Footwear rejected similar arguments to those made by the United States:

Moreover, it appears that an interpretation whereby these subsequent Resolutions are considered to be measures separate and independent from the definitive safeguard measure, and thus outside our terms of reference, could be contrary to Article 3.3 of the DSU. Such an interpretation could allow a situation where a matter brought to the DSB for prompt settlement is not resolved when the defendant changes the legal form of the measure through a separate but closely related instrument, while the measure in dispute remains essentially the same in substance. In this way, Members could always keep one step ahead of any WTO dispute settlement proceeding because in such a situation, the complaining Member would indeed, challenge a "moving target", and panel and Appellate Body's findings could already be overtaken by events when they are rendered and adopted by the DSB.18

22. Brazil maintains that the Agricultural Assistance Act of 2003 constitutes a subsequent, separate but closely related instrument, that is essentially the same as the legal instruments authorizing the MY 1999 and MY 2000 cottonseed payments and that is, therefore, within the Panel's terms of reference.

II. ARTICLE 13(B): DOMESTIC SUPPORT MEASURES
A. "EXEMPT FROM ACTIONS"
(20) In paragraph 8 of its initial brief (dated 5 June, 2003), the United States argued that the word "actions" as used in the phrase "exempt from actions" in Article 13 of the Agreement on Agriculture includes the "bringing of a case" and consultations. In paragraph 36 of its first written submission (dated 11 July, 2003), the United States stated as follows:
"[P]rior to this point in the process, the DSU rules did not afford the United States any opportunity to prevent the dispute from proceeding through consultations and panel establishment automatically, regardless of the US insistence that its measures conform to the Peace Clause." Is it the United States' understanding that the drafters used the phrase "exempt from actions" knowing that under the DSU it would not be possible fully to exempt "actions", as the United States interprets that term?
(21) In US - FSC and US - FSC (21.5) the Appellate Body made findings under the SCM Agreement relating to export subsidies in respect of agricultural products without making a finding in respect of Article 13 of the Agreement on Agriculture. How is this relevant to the United States' interpretation of the phrase "exempt from actions" as used in Article 13? USA
Brazil's Comment on US Answers:
23. The United States and the European Communities maintain that the complaining party has the burden of proof under Article 13 of the Agreement on Agriculture. More specifically, they claim that Article 13 is not in the nature of an affirmative defence. Brazil's comment will again show that their position is untenable.
24. In its 11 August Answer to Question 20 of the Panel, the United States asserts, under the "exempt from action" argument, that "Brazil has attempted to improperly invoke dispute settlement procedures notwithstanding the Peace Clause."19 According to the United States, a dispute settlement procedure could only be initiated after a determination of non-compliance with Article 13 has been made. In its 11 August Answer to Question 21, the United States then dismisses the findings in US ­ FSC by simply stating that they do not address the peace clause and that the issue was not raised by either party in that case.20 Therefore, those rulings and recommendations "provide no guidance for purposes of this dispute".
25. The EC maintains that "Article 13 is more akin to a threshold permitting further action if the threshold is not complied with."21 The EC affirms that Article 13 "is an integral part of the Agreement on Agriculture".22 In that sense it would be comparable to Article 6 of the ATC, Article 3.3 of the SPS Agreement, and Article 2.4 of the TBT Agreement, which were found not to be affirmative defences by the Appellate Body.23 According to the EC, those provisions, like Article 13 of the Agreement on Agriculture, "provide certain rights to WTO Members, but cannot be seen as exceptions".24

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-142
26. Brazil disagrees. The Appellate Body addressed the issue of burden of proof on numerous occasions. In US ­ Shirts and Blouses, the Appellate Body made a general finding stating that
... the burden of proof rests upon the party, whether complaining or defending, who asserts the affirmative of a particular claim or defence. If that party adduces evidence sufficient to raise a presumption that what is claimed is true, the burden then shifts to the other party, who will fail unless it adduces sufficient evidence to rebut the presumption. In the context of the GATT 1994 and the WTO Agreement, precisely how much and precisely what kind of evidence will be required to establish such a presumption will necessarily vary from measure to measure, provision to provision, and case to case.25
27. When examining Article 6 of the ATC, Article 3.3 of the SPS Agreement, and Article 2.4 of the TBT Agreement, the Appellate Body did not stray from this principle. In fact, it was the cornerstone of all determinations concerning the above-cited provisions. Paragraph 275 of the Appellate Body report in EC ­ Sardines reads:
In EC ­ Hormones, we found that a "general rule-exception" relationship between Articles 3.1 and 3.3 of the SPS Agreement does not exist, with the consequence that the complainant had to establish a case of inconsistency with both Articles 3.1 and 3.3.196 We reached this conclusion as a consequence of our finding there that "Article 3.1 of the SPS Agreement simply excludes from its scope of application the kinds of situations covered by Article 3.3 of that Agreement".197 Similarly, the circumstances envisaged in the second part of Article 2.4 are excluded from the scope of application of the first part of Article 2.4. Accordingly, as with Articles 3.1 and 3.3 of the SPS Agreement, there is no "general rule-exception" relationship between the first and the second parts of Article 2.4. Hence, in this case, it is for Peru ­ as the complaining Member seeking a ruling on the inconsistency with Article 2.4 of the TBT Agreement of the measure applied by the European Communities ­ to bear the burden of proving its claim. (emphasis added) (footnotes omitted)26
28. With regard to Article 6 of the ATC, the Appellate Body found that provision to be a fundamental part of the rights and obligations of WTO Members concerning non-integrated textile and clothing products covered by the ATC during the transition period. Consequently a party claiming a violation of a provision of the WTO Agreement by another Member must assert and prove its claim. In this case, India claimed a violation by the United States of Article 6 of the ATC. We agree with the Panel that it, therefore, was up to India to put forward evidence and legal argument sufficient to demonstrate that the transitional safeguard action by the United States was inconsistent with the obligations assumed by the United States under Articles 2 and 6 of the ATC. (emphasis added)27
29. Unlike the EC, Brazil believes that these Appellate Body findings underscore the striking differences between Article 13 of the Agreement on Agriculture and the other provisions cited by the EC and which the Appellate Body found not to be in the nature of an affirmative defence.
30. First, Brazil notes that in all Appellate Body findings, the complaining party claimed a violation of the provision at issue. The complaining party tried to impute the burden of proof on the respondent by alleging that those provisions also contained language that provided an opportunity for an affirmative defence under an "exception" to the general rule.
25 Appellate Body Report, US ­ Shirts and Blouses, p. 14. 26 Appellate Body Report, EC ­ Sardines, para. 275. 27 Appellate Body Report, US ­ Shirts and Blouses, p. 16.

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-143
31. Article 13 of the Agreement on Agriculture is entirely different. The peace clause imposes no obligations on WTO Members. As the EC rightfully stated in paragraph 6 of its Initial Submission of 10 June 2003:
a Member is not under an obligation to act consistently with Article 13 of the Agreement on Agriculture ­ failing to respect Article 13 implies that a Member no longer enjoys protection thereof. Consequently ... Article 13 of the Agreement on Agriculture can only be seen as a defence against a claim brought under other aspects of the WTO Agreements which regulate the provision of subsidies. It would seem bizarre if before Brazil could bring a claim with respect to subsidies which it considered did not respect the US's obligations, Brazil had first to establish that potential defences did not apply. (italics in original) (underlining added)28
32. Brazil entirely agrees with the characterization of Article 13 as a potential defence against claims brought before the WTO. In fact, as the Panel is well aware, in Brazil's request for the establishment of the Panel, Brazil does not claim that the United States violated Article 13. Such violation is indeed impossible, since Article 13 of the Agreement on Agriculture imposes no obligations whatsoever on WTO Members. Article 13 simply provides shelter to Members that invoke its exemption from actions based on certain other provisions of the WTO Agreements. Again, as the Appellate Body stressed every single time it addressed the issue, "the burden of proof rests upon the party, whether complaining or defending, who asserts the affirmative of a particular claim or defence."29
33. Second, Brazil's interpretation is entirely compatible with the findings of the panel and the Appellate Body in US ­ FSC. Brazil, unlike the United States, considers these finding to be very relevant to this dispute. In US ­ FSC, the United States decided not to invoke Article 13 of the Agreement on Agriculture as a possible defence against the challenges brought by the EC. The panel and the Appellate Body did not need to address Article 13 simply because it was not used as a defence by the respondent. This situation is not necessarily unusual. For example, a respondent that knows, in advance, that it is not complying with the requirements of Article 13, may well choose to directly rebut the prima facie case of the complainant by providing rebuttal arguments and evidence without attempting to use the Article 13 shelter.
34. Indeed, interpreting Article 13 of the Agreement on Agriculture as a "threshold"30 provision is at odds with the Appellate Body's findings in US ­ FSC, US­ FSC (21.5), Mexico ­ HFCS (21.5) and US ­ Byrd Amendment. In Mexico ­ HFCS (21.5), the Appellate Body held that
We believe that a panel comes under a duty to address issues in at least two instances. First, as a matter of due process, and the proper exercise of the judicial function, panels are required to address issues that are put before them by the parties to a dispute. Second, panels have to address and dispose of certain issues of a fundamental nature, even if the parties to the dispute remain silent on those issues. In this regard, we have previously observed that `[t]he vesting of jurisdiction in a panel is a fundamental prerequisite for the lawful panel proceeding.' For this reason, panels cannot simply ignore issues which go to the root of their jurisdiction ­ that is, to their authority to deal with and dispose of matters. Rather, panels must deal with such issues ­ if necessary, on their own motion ­ in order to satisfy themselves that they have authority to proceed. (emphasis added) (footnote omitted)31

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-144
35. The Appellate Body applied this reasoning to itself in US ­ Byrd Amendment. In that case, the Appellate Body examined an issue related to the Panels jurisdiction, although it was not addressed before the Panel or, indeed mentioned in the notice of appeal.32 If Article 13 of the Agreement on Agriculture were a threshold provision affecting the jurisdiction of a panel or the Appellate Body, both the panels and the Appellate Body in US ­ FSC and US ­ FSC (21.5) would have had to address the issue of peace clause exemption of the claims brought by the EC. The fact that none of them did is further evidence that Article 13 is not a "threshold" or jurisdictional provision. As Brazil maintains, Article 13 of the Agreement on Agriculture is an affirmative defence.
36. Further, Brazil does not claim that Article 13 is an "exception". Brazil does not claim that the United States "violated" Article 13 and, therefore, Brazil does not bear the burden of proving any such assertion. Actually, Brazil simply does not believe that Article 13 is at all relevant to claims raised under the SCM Agreement or GATT Article XVI until the respondent claims that it is exempt by the provisions of the peace clause. The respondent claiming such exemption has the burden of proving that it is entitled to it.33 If the respondent does not claim such protection, Article 13 is moot, as demonstrated by the US ­ FSC case.
37. In paragraph 11 of its Oral Statement of 24 July, the EC points out that no "credible response" was given to the argument it put forward suggesting that Brazil's approach "has perverse effects".34 The EC claimed that
if Article 13 is considered an affirmative defence, when a complainant brings a dispute under Articles 5 and 6 of the SCM Agreement and, for instance, Article 6 of the Agreement on Agriculture, the complainant would be required to prove a breach of Article 6 while at the same time the defendant would also be required to prove that it had not infringed Article 6 of the Agreement. The burden of proof cannot switch between parties simply on the basis of whether the complainant cites the SCM Agreement or not ..." (italics on the original)35
38. Brazil fails to see the conundrum that seems to puzzle the EC. If the complainant cites the SCM Agreement or, better still, alleges a violation of the SCM Agreement together with a violation of Article 6 of the Agreement on Agriculture, the burden of proving both assertions rests on the complainant irrespective of the fact that the respondent may invoke Article 13. If the complainant fails to establish the violation of Article 6 of the Agreement on Agriculture, then the task of the respondent to invoke the Article 13 shelter against a possible violation of the SCM Agreement is made that much easier. In fact, the burden of proof concerning the violation of Article 6 of the Agreement on Agriculture will simply start with the complainant. As the Appellate Body noted in US ­ Shirts and Blouses, if the complainant "adduces evidence sufficient to raise a presumption that what is claimed is true, the burden shifts to the other party, who will fail unless it adduces sufficient evidence to rebut the presumption". Therefore, the burden of proof may well switch between parties, but not "on the basis of whether the complainant cites the SCM Agreement", as the EC suggested in its Oral Statement.
39. In sum, Brazil reemphasizes that the peace clause is in the nature of an affirmative defence.

B. "SUCH MEASURES" AND ANNEX 2 OF THE AGREEMENT ON AGRICULTURE
(22) Please explain the difference, if any, between the meaning of "defined" and the meaning of "fixed" in the phrase "a defined and fixed base period" in paragraph 6(a) of Annex 2 of the Agreement on Agriculture.
Brazil's Comment on US Answer:
40. The United States 11 August Answer to Question 22 renders the meaning of the word "fixed" meaningless by isolating the phrase "relative position" from the full dictionary definition.36 The complete definition includes the phrase "definite, permanent, and lasting".37 There is nothing "permanent" about the US interpretation of the meaning of "fixed base period" for the PFC and direct payment programmes. For further comments on the issue, Brazil refers the Panel to paragraphs 10-12 of its Rebuttal Submission.
(24) How often can a Member define and fix a base period in accordance with paragraph 6 of Annex 2 of the Agreement on Agriculture?
Brazil's Comment on US Answer:
41. Brazil agrees with the United States' statement that there is "no requirement in paragraph 6 that a particular base period be used for a decoupled income support measure nor that the same base period be used for purposes of every decoupled income support measure."38 But this misses the point. The legal and factual question is whether a measure for which a new base period is "fixed" has the same structure, design, and eligibility criteria as an older replaced measure which had a different base period. The evidence demonstrates that PFC payments and direct payments have a similar structure, design, and eligibility criteria.39
(29) Please explain the meaning of the words "the fundamental requirement" as used in paragraph 1 of Annex 2 of the Agreement on Agriculture.
Brazil's Comment on US Answer:
42. The United States argues in response to this question that "compliance with the fundamental requirement of the first sentence will be demonstrated by conforming to the basic criteria of the second sentence plus the applicable policy-specific criteria of paragraphs 6-13."40 Brazil disagrees that compliance with the basic and policy-specific criteria is a sufficient condition for compliance with the fundamental requirement. For example, the volume of direct payments that conform to the criteria in paragraph 6 is not limited. However, the amount of support a Member provides may be so large that the payments create significant production and trade-distorting effects. Therefore, even if direct payments conform to the basic and policy-specific criteria in Annex 2, they may still have considerable production and trade-distorting effects. Brazil refers to its arguments in support of the "stand-alone" nature of the fundamental requirement.41
36 Brazil 11 August Answer to Question 22, para. 20. 37 The New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary, 1993 edition, p. 962. 38 US 11 August Answer to Question 24. 39 See Rebuttal Submission of Brazil, para. 10. 40 US 11 August Answer to Question 29, para. 59. 41 First Submission of Brazil, para. 163-165; Brazil's 11 August Answer to Questions 27-28, para. 3243.

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-146
(32) If the first sentence of paragraph 1 of Annex 2 expresses a general principle which informs the interpretation of the criteria in Annex 2, please explain how this affects the assessment of the direct payments programme's compliance with paragraph 6 of Annex 2.
Brazil's Comment on US Answer:
43. Contrary to the US argument at paragraph 68 of its 11 August Answers, there is no conflict between the Brazil's position regarding the fruits, vegetables and wild rice prohibition and Annex 2, paragraph 1 "fundamental requirement". The undisputed facts show that this prohibition on the production of certain crops channels production to other crops that are permitted to be produced to receive the payment.42 This channeling of payments creates production and trade distorting effects inconsistent with Annex 2, paragraph 1.
44. Further, the United States engages in a wishful interpretation when it states in paragraph 68 of its 11 August Answer that "paragraph 6(b) should be read to prevent a Member from requiring a recipient to produce certain crops". This interpretation would render Annex 2, paragraph 6(e) a nullity. Paragraph 6(e) provides that "no production shall be required in order to receive such payments". The US interpretation of paragraph 6(b) as not requiring the production of "certain crops" is the same as 6(e)'s prohibition on not requiring production of "any crops".
45. Paragraph 6(b) is distinct from paragraph 6(e) because it provides a clear test that the amount of payment cannot be related to the type of production. There is no factual dispute among the parties that the amount of PFC and direct payments falls when base acres are used to produce fruits, vegetables, tree nuts, and wild rice. There is no factual dispute that the 1996 FAIR Act and the 2002 FSRI Act require the prohibition or reduction in payments if these crops are produced on base acreage. Given these two undisputed facts and the clear text of Annex 2, paragraph 6(b), the only conclusion is that PFC and direct payments do not meet the policy specific criteria of Annex 2.
C. "DO NOT GRANT SUPPORT TO A SPECIFIC COMMODITY"
(33) According to the United States' interpretation of the word "grant", when can a Member claim that a measure is not exempt from action under Article 13(b)? what if the measures is enacted annually? Can the Member obtain a remedy in respect of that measure under the DSU?
Brazil Comment to US Answer:
46. Brazil's addresses in detail the US "statute of limitations" argument at paragraphs 88-96 of its Rebuttal Submission, as well as at paragraphs 40-47 of its Oral Statement.
(37) In the United States' view, why did the drafters not use the exact term "productspecific" in Article 13(b)(ii)?
Brazil Comment on US Answer:
47. The United States' 11 August Answer once again reveals that it equates the term "support to a specific commodity" with "product-specific". Brazil notes again that neither the phrase "productspecific" nor "AMS" is found in the text of Article 13(b). Given the use of such terms in the Agreement on Agriculture, the Drafters must be presumed to have used the term "support to a specific commodity" for a reason. The US answer ignores the likely reason which is that "support to a specific commodity" is qualified by the term "such measures" which includes the universe of non-
42 See Rebuttal Submission of Brazil, para. 7.

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-147
green box support measures in the chapeau to Article 13(b). This universe of measures from which such support may be found is not limited to simply "product-specific" measures.
(38) Given the fact that subsidies available for more than one product could have various effects on production, how does the United States demarcate between product-specific support and non-product specific support?
Brazil's Comment on US Answer:
48. The United States demarcation line does not take into account the definition of "non-product specific" in Article 1(a) which is "provided in favour of agricultural producers in general". This "in general" language shows where the line between product-specific and non-product specific must be drawn. Any support that is not provided to producers "in general" cannot, by definition, be nonproduct specific support. It must instead fall into the category of "product-specific support". The United States fails to recognize that the term "in general" is directly related to and qualifies the phrase "support . . . provided for an agricultural product in favour of the producers of the basic agricultural product".
49. The "demarcation" line drawn by the United States between "product-specific" and "nonproduct specific" support is necessary to justify the narrow US specificity test for Article 13(b)(ii). The United States argues that support could only be "product-specific" if "production is necessary for the support to be received."43 Yet, the Article 1(a) notion of "support" "provided for an agricultural product in favour of the producers of the basic agricultural product" is very broad. It could include any type of support, regardless of whether production was required or not. For example, if the facts demonstrate that $1 billion of support were received by the "producers of a basic agricultural product" (such as in the case of CCP payments to upland cotton producers in MY 2002), the language of Article 1(a) would support the finding that this support is "product-specific". The only restraint on such a conclusion is if it could be shown that all, or most of the producers of agricultural products received the same type of support. However, none of the five domestic support payments at issue in this dispute comes even close to such an "in general" finding. The inclusion of such subsidies as "support to a specific commodity" is confirmed by the context of Article 13(b)(ii) which includes Annex 3 of the Agreement on Agriculture as discussed in paragraphs 17-22 of Brazil's Rebuttal Submission.
50. Further, the United States never addresses the premise of the Panel's question, i.e, that subsidies for more than one product could have various effects on production. This is exactly the situation with PFC, market loss, direct payments, CCP payments, and crop insurance subsidies. The evidence (which consists in large part of the statements of present or former USDA economists) shows the production enhancing effects of each of these subsidies.
51. The US 11 August Answer highlights the narrowness of its Article 13(b)(ii) specificity test. Trade and production-distorting amber box support from each of these five subsidies increases US production and sustains high levels of US exports of upland cotton. Yet, under the US specificity test, it could never be deemed "support to" upland cotton because no production of upland cotton is legally required. The Panel should reject this approach and find that these programmes provide support to upland cotton.
(39) If "such measures" in Article 13(b)(ii) refers to all those in the chapeau of Article 13(b), why are they not included in the potential comparisons with 1992? In what circumstances can measures which grant non-product specific support lose exemption from action under Articles 5 and 6 of the SCM Agreement and Article XVI of GATT 1994?
43 US 11 August Answer to Question 38, para. 81.

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-148
Brazil Comment to US Answer:
52. The United States 11 August Answer does not address the second of the Panel's questions directly. But based on the argument in the "answer," the direct answer to the question would have been "there are no circumstances in which measures which grant non-product specific support lose exemption from action under Articles 5 and 6 of the SCM Agreement and Article XVI of GATT 1994." The arguments presented by the United States in its answer confirms that its interpretation creates a broad new category of "exempt" non-green box support ­ those presumptively trade and productiondistorting measures it labels "non-product specific". The US constructs this new exempt category by improperly interpreting the phrase "product-specific" to include only non-green box support legally requiring the production of upland cotton. This incorrect definition is inconsistent with the fact that in analogous situations involving calculation of AMS, paragraphs 12-13 of Annex 3 of the Agreement on Agriculture require all types of non-green box support providing support to the producers of an agricultural commodity be included in the amount tabulated. These points are further discussed in paragraphs 13-67 of Brazil's Rebuttal Submission.
53. The US 11 August Answer to the first question in paragraph 84 indicates that it interprets the phrase "such measures" as only including "product-specific" support. Even apart from the incorrect US definition, such an interpretation renders a nullity the reference to most of the "measures" referred to in the "such measures" phrase of Article 13(b)(ii). If the drafters had intended to limit the universe of non-green box support in the manner suggested by the United States, they would have used the phrase "product-specific" instead of "such measures". The better interpretation that does not render the chapeau a nullity is that suggested by Brazil: any type of support listed in the chapeau which provides "support to a specific commodity" must be included within the support to be counted for the purpose of the required 13(b)(ii) comparison.
D. "IN EXCESS OF THAT DECIDED DURING THE 1992 MARKETING YEAR"
General Comment by Brazil on the US Answers to Questions 47-69
54. Brazil notes that the United States has not fully answered many of the questions posed by the Panel. The United States further announced in various questions that it would provide its views on certain questions posed by the Panel in its rebuttal submission. In the answers provided, the United States has continued to pursue its overly simplistic view of an alleged "decision" to provide a rate of support of 72.9 cents per pound in MY 1992. Brazil has pointed out that this rate of support does not accurately reflect the operation of the US support system to upland cotton and that it ignores restrictions on the availability of support and costs associated with the participation in the support programmes.44 Professor Sumner has attempted to correct the overly simplistic US approach and has presented data to that respect.45
55. A fundamental flaw exposed by the US 11 August Answers is the inability of the US "72.9 methodology" to account for a number of different types of "support to upland cotton". In its 11 August Answer to Question 67, the United States provides a calculation of upland cotton AMS that lists as "product-specific" support Step 2 payments (user marketing certificates), cottonseed payments, storage payments, and interest subsidies, in addition to deficiency payments, and marketing loan payments. Yet, the United States "72.9 methodology" does not ­ and cannot ­ account for cottonseed payments, Step 2 payments, storage payments and interest rate subsidies. The United States takes no account of these subsidies ­ no matter how large the expenditures may be ­ because they do not fit within the US methodology. So they simply disappear.
44 Oral Statement of Brazil, para. 36; Brazil's 11 August Answer to Question 66(c), para. 120-128. 45 See Exhibit Bra-105 (Statement of Professor Sumner at the First Meeting of the Panel).

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-149
56. Any methodology that cannot account for all of the support "decided" and "granted" in MY 1992 and during the implementation period cannot be legitimate. A methodology that would sanction the cover-up of hundreds of millions ­ if not billions ­ of dollars of expenditures cannot be justified by the object and purpose of Agreement on Agriculture or by any reasonable reading of the text of Article 13(b)(ii).
57. With these general points in mind, Brazil comments on the answers provided by the United States.
(43) What are the precise differences between deficiency payments and counter-cyclical payments that lead you to classify the former as product-specific and the latter as non-product specific? How do you classify market loss assistance payments?
Brazil's Comment on US Answer:
58. The US 11 August Answer at paragraph 87-90 reveals its erroneous interpretation of the phrase "product-specific" in Article 1(a) of the Agreement on Agriculture. The United States ignores the phrase "in general" and assumes that "non-product specific" support is a huge residual category of support that includes everything except support which requires production of a specific product. Further, the United States' answer ignores the fact that all types of support in favour of domestic producers of a basic commodity are included in the analogous AMS calculation of Annex 3 ­ including "product-specific" support where the recipient is not required to produce a specific commodity. Brazil outlines the erroneous US interpretation in paragraphs 13-23 of its Rebuttal Submission.
59. The improper narrow US interpretation of "product-specific" is highlighted in its discussion of counter-cyclical payments where the only relevant fact is that a producer receiving CCP payments need not plant any crop at all. Brazil addresses in detail the evidence demonstrating that CCP payments are "support to" upland cotton in paragraphs 48-52 of its Rebuttal Submission.
60. With respect to market loss assistance payments, Brazil notes that it provides a detailed analysis of how such payments are "support to upland cotton" in paragraphs 29-35 of its Rebuttal Submission, as well as in paragraphs 50-54 of its Oral Statement. Contrary to the US statement in paragraph 92 of its 11 August Answers, Brazil has always asserted that market loss assistance payments are "support to a specific commodity", i.e., to upland cotton.
(46) What is the relevance, if any, of the concept of "specificity" in Article 2 of the SCM Agreement and reference to "a product" or "subsidized product" in certain provisions of the SCM Agreement to the meaning of "support to a specific commodity" in Article 13(b)(ii) Agreement on Agriculture?
Brazil's comment to US Answer:
61. For the reasons set forth in Brazil's 11 August Answer to this question, Brazil believes that Article 2 of the SCM Agreement provides useful context in interpreting the concept of specificity in Article 13(b)(ii). Brazil notes that the very narrow US notion of specificity (only support requiring recipients to produce the commodity in question) for Article 13(b)(ii) is quite different than the very broad concept of specificity applying to all commodities (including agricultural commodities) as set out in the US SAA referred to in Brazil's answer. The United States has not provided any reasons why there should be such a radically different concept of specificity involving non-green box domestic support measures under Article 13(b)(ii) and all types of products (including agricultural goods) under the SCM Agreement. Brazil sees no basis for such a significant difference.

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-150
(48) Does Article 13(b)(ii) require a comparison of support granted with support decided? How could such a comparison be made?
Brazil's Comment on US Answer:
62. Brazil comments on the US 11 August Answer to Question 48 in the context of its Rebuttal Submission at paragraphs 68-96.
(54) Please identify all United States legal and regulatory and administrative instruments decided during the marketing year 1992, with the respective dates of decision, that decided support for upland cotton.
Brazil's Comment on US Answer:
63. As Brazil has noted in its general comment at paragraphs 54-57 above, the United States focuses solely on the alleged target price decision of 72.9 cents per pound. This simplistic approach does not accurately reflect the actual operation of the US support programmes to upland cotton. As detailed by Professor Sumner in his Statement at the First Meeting, the United States took a number of decisions concerning support for the 1992 marketing year.46
64. Professor Sumner ­ who actually participated in the decision making process concerning the MY 1992 acreage reduction programme decision ­ explained during the First Meeting of the Panel that the decision on the percentage of upland cotton base that farmers participating in the deficiency payment programme had to leave idle was a conscious decision based on, inter alia, budgetary considerations. Given expectations about production and prices in the upcoming marketing year, the decision on the acreage reduction programme was also a decision on expected participation. The United States could base expected participation on historical experience about participation in the deficiency payment program. Professor Sumner indicated that USDA was able to fairly accurately predict actual participation. The decision on the amount of mandatory acreage reduction is, thus, a decision on the level of participation.
65. Professor Sumner's testimony is supported by the Chief and Deputy Chief Economist of USDA who have explained that the aim of the acreage reduction programme was "to balance supply and demand"47, i.e., to influence prices and thereby US budgetary outlays. They furthermore report that the United States implemented the acreage reduction programme with a view of reducing costly government stocks, and that the United States ­ with further budget considerations in mind ­ reduced target prices.48
66. Furthermore, the United States ignores various required additional administrative decisions that were necessary to make its domestic support programmes operative. These decisions include decisions on the deficiency payment rate, on weekly Step 2 payment rates and on a weeklydetermined adjusted world price setting the amounts of marketing loan benefits available for that week. By taking all of these decisions, the United States directly influenced the expenditures related to the MY 1992 crop.49 In addition, as the United States now reflects in its AMS data, the
46 Exhibit Bra-105 (Statement of Professor Daniel Sumner at the First Meeting, para. 7-8). 47 Exhibit Bra-180 ("Will Policy Changes Usher in a New Era of Increased Agricultural Market Variability?," Keith J. Collins, Joseph W. Glauber, Choices, Second Quarter 1998, p. 27). 48 Exhibit Bra-180 ("Will Policy Changes Usher in a New Era of Increased Agricultural Market Variability?," Keith J. Collins, Joseph W. Glauber, Choices, Second Quarter 1998, p. 27). 49 Brazil acknowledges that the United States could not possible determine its expenditures as they would depend to a certain extent on market prices that were also influenced by factors outside the control of the US Government.

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-151
United States considers storage payments and interest subsidies50 as product-specific support to upland cotton. Consequently, under the US approach, these product-specific domestic support measures need to be taken into account for purposes of the Article 13(b)(ii) decision. Yet, the United States fails to account for these programmes in its list of decisions taken concerning support to upland cotton, just as it failed to account for various decisions relating to the deficiency payment, marketing loan and Step 2 programmes.
67. Brazil also notes that the United States failed to answer Question 54 that asked the United States to identify "all" instruments that decided support for upland cotton. This would also cover instruments other than product-specific instruments. However, the United States has only followed its simplistic view of what kind of decision it took and has not provided information on other decisions. This appears to be an attempt to avoid the conclusion under all other approaches: that the United States provided support in MY 1999-2002 in excess of that decided during the 1992 marketing year.
(55) Please provide a copy of the instruments in which the rate of support for upland cotton during the marketing year 1992 was decided, indicating the date of the decision.
Brazil's Comment on US Answer:
68. As noted in Brazil's Comment to the previous question, the United States failed to identify a list of decisions taken with respect to support for upland cotton in MY 1992. As a consequence, the United States also failed to provide copies of those instruments.51
(57) If the United States decided on a rate of support for MY1992, does that not mean that it decided on whatever budgetary outlay was required to meet that rate of support, even if the exact amount was not known at that time?
Brazil's Comment on US Answer:
69. At the outset, Brazil refers the Panel to the general comment made in respect of the set of questions referring to the term "decision" in Article 13(b)(ii) of the Agreement on Agriculture. Also this answer suffers from the simplistic picture the United States draws of its MY 1992 support programmes to upland cotton.
70. Brazil disagrees with the United States that it could not be said that the United States decided on budgetary outlays. Indeed, for all of the US programmes, there was a decision to authorize whatever budgetary outlays would be necessary to meet the rate of support.52 In addition, the United States ignores that it has admitted that there were other programmes that meet its definition of "product-specific" and that do not provide a rate of support: Step 2, cottonseed, storage payments and interest subsidies. The United States accounted for those subsidies by providing budgetary outlays in its upland cotton AMS calculation, but it does not provide any information on the decision taken with respect to those domestic support measures and the rate of support provided by them. In addition, the United States took specific administrative decisions on the deficiency payment rate for MY 1992 (20.3 cents per pound53), weekly Step 2 payment rates as well as weekly decision on the adjusted world price and, thus, the rate of marketing loan benefits. By taking these decisions, the United States decided on the payment rates that resulted from the "rate of support" and, therefore, on the amount of budgetary outlays it would use from its unlimited spending authority.
50 Brazil notes that the United States nowhere provides any information concerning the type and conditions of payments that are covered by these terms.
51 See paras. 63-67 supra. 52 First Submission of Brazil, para. 141. 53 Exhibit Bra-4 ("Fact Sheet: Upland Cotton," USDA, January 2003, p. 5).

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-152
71. Brazil further disagrees with the US assertion at paragraph 113 of its 11 August Answers that the programs decided by the United States required an unlimited budgetary authority in both MY 1992 and in later marketing years.54 Even at prices of zero cents per pound, the amount of US expenditure for the deficiency payment and the marketing loan programme in MY 1992 was, in fact, limited by decisions restricting the participation in the programs to farmers that historically had grown upland cotton, who were eligible, and who decided to participate based on the eligibility criteria. By contrast, participation in the MY 2002 marketing loan programme, the crop insurance programme, and the Step 2 programme, for instance, is no longer limited and now has an unlimited budgetary authority coupled with mandatory payment provisions. In particular, the marketing loan programme is now unlimited whereas in MY 1992, eligibility to marketing loan benefits was restricted to upland cotton grown on acreage that was enrolled in the deficiency payment programme.
72. In sum, the United States not only "decided on whatever outlay was required to meet that rate of support", it also took various administrative decisions that implemented the rate of support and transposed it into specific payment rates that resulted in identifiable budgetary outlays. The United States took those decisions with respect to all of the programmes including crop insurance and Step 2, as well as with respect to storage payments and interest subsidies.55 Thus, the collective effect of these multiple decisions was to decide on the amount of expenditures for MY 1992. The only way to express this multitude of decisions and conduct the required comparison with MY 1999-2002 is to use total monetary amounts of budgetary expenditures.
(60) Can you provide information on the support decided in 1992 and the years with which you believe it should be compared, on a per support programme / per unit of production basis / per annum basis? If possible, please specify how, if at all, budget outlays may be transposed into units of production, and which units of production are best to use.
Brazil's Comment on US Answer:
73. Brazil notes that the United States has not provided, as requested, any per support measure, per unit figures of support that it decided in 1992 and support it granted in other years. Nor did the United States provide any information whatsoever on how to account for Step 2 payments, cottonseed payments, storage payments and interest subsidies because there is no way such measures could be measured using the simplistic US rate of support only approach.
74. In addition, the United States does not respond to the Panel's request to transpose this rate of support into budgetary outlays per pound of production. Brazil refers the Panel to paragraphs 84-85 of its Rebuttal Submission, where it provides a new chart reflecting new information provided by the United States for various programmes.56
(61) Does the United States consider that Article 13(b)(ii) permits a comparison on any other than a per pound basis?
Brazil's Comment on US Answer:
75. The United States admits that Article 13(b)(ii), and in particular the term "decided", permit a comparison different from comparing a rate of support, had the US domestic support measures been structured (i.e. decided) differently than characterized by the United States.57 This admission is significant, because, in fact, the US measures were structured quite differently from what the

United States asserts. Professor Sumner58 established that the US support programmes in MY 1992 did not provide a rate of support of 72.9 cents per pound to each pound of upland cotton produced in the United States. Numerous restrictions on the availability of the support by the deficiency payment programme and the marketing loan programme existed. In addition, participation in both programmes was costly to farmers, as farmers were mandated to set aside a certain percentage of acreage every year. USDA Chief Economist Keith J. Collins and USDA Deputy Chief Economist Joseph W. Glauber explain that
[s]everal programme changes beginning with the 1985 Farm Act reduced the ability of deficiency payments to stabilize incomes by fixing programme payment yields, reducing the amount of acreage eligible for payments, and tightening payment limits. In addition, many producers elected not to participate in farm programs, making a large portion of production not covered by payments and a large portion of producers ineligible for them by the early 1990s.59
76. This statement confirms the existence of severe restrictions on the availability of deficiency payments and the cost of participating in the programmes. Were there no cost associated with the programme, no rational farmer would opt to not take the "free money", i.e., nearly everybody would participate. These conscious decisions by USDA and other US Government agencies must, therefore, be reflected in the claimed rate of support provided by the various non-green box domestic support measures during MY 1992.
77. Brazil agrees with the European Communities that such a mélange of domestic support measures decided in MY 1992 must be accounted for "in monetary terms".60 While the European Communities advocates using an AMS-like approach for the support decided in MY 1992,61 Brazil considers that an expenditure approach more accurately reflects the text of Article 13(b)(ii), which does not refer to AMS or "product-specific". Brazil emphasizes that the domestic support measures that need to be included in this approach are all those domestic support measures that provide support to upland cotton.
78. Furthermore, the US "72.9 methodology" is inconsistent with the object and purpose of Article 13(b)(ii) and of the Agreement on Agriculture to correct and prevent restrictions and distortions in world agricultural markets.
79. Accepting the US interpretation that eligibility criteria and participation costs of a programme are irrelevant would enable Members like the United States to avoid the disciplines of the SCM Agreement on trade-distortive subsidies. For example, the United States in MY 1992 decided and applied restrictive support programmes that required costly land set aside programs, low payment yields, restricted payments to 85 per cent of eligible acres, tied benefits from the marketing loan programme to participation in the costly deficiency payment programs, and applied payment limitations, among others. The US interpretations would allow it in MY 2002 to lift all of these restrictions and maintain the rate of support without affecting its entitlement to peace clause exemption. The approach taken to its extreme would allow a Member that decided a rate of support of 72.9 cents per pound for 0.0001 per cent of its production in MY 1992, to provide a rate of support of 72.9 cents per pound to 100 per cent of its production in MY 2002 without affecting its entitlement to peace clause exemption. Every legitimate comparison must take account of economic realities of support regimes in MY 1992 and in later marketing years during the implementation period. And these realities show that the support increased massively.

(66) Could you please comment on the relative merits of each of the following calculation methods for purposes of the comparison of support to upland cotton with 1992, irrespective of whether a particular measure should be included or excluded:
(a) Total budgetary outlays (Brazil's approach)
(b) Budgetary outlays per unit of upland cotton: Could you please calculate and provide an estimate for the marketing years 1992 and 1999-2002, respectively, and draw the Panel's attention to any factors / qualifications that the Panel would need to be aware of.
Brazil's Comment on US Answers:
80. Brazil comments jointly on both of the 11 August Answers provided by the United States. In essence, the United States rejects any approach based on budgetary outlays as ex post or retrospective and as does not reflecting its alleged single decision taken during MY 1992.62 Based on the same argument, the United States also declines the Panel's request for information on how to calculate budgetary outlays per unit of upland cotton.63 Therefore, Brazil refers the Panel to its own 11 August Answer to Question 60 and 66(b) for the only evidence in that respect as well as to Brazil's reservations concerning this approach.64
81. The United States maintains that because its support programmes depend on a price-gap, only a rate of support approach can reflect the US decision.65 It further maintains, that any budgetary approach would automatically reflect also producers' planting and participation decisions and market prices, factors that the United States alleges, it could not have decided.66 However, Brazil has demonstrated that the anticipated participation in the deficiency payment and marketing loan programme was an important aspect of the decision on the acreage reduction programme. Professor Sumner has indicated that, based on historical participation data and projections about other programme parameters, the United States in MY 1992 had a very good idea of the participation rate that would result from the setting of a 10-per cent acreage reduction rate under the deficiency payment programme.
82. Further, Brazil has demonstrated above that the range of programme decisions the United States has taken, including decisions on deficiency payment rates, adjusted world prices and Step 2 payment rates in connection with decisions on other programme parameters, impacted the amount of budgetary outlays. Thus, while the United States certainly did not decide on market prices, it took a number of decisions that translated these market prices into actual expenditures for MY 1992.
83. The European Communities and other third parties to this dispute agree with Brazil that the appropriate basis for a comparison of the support decided in MY 1992 with support granted in later marketing years during the implementation period is a approach based "on monetary terms".67 Given the special situation of the EC with respect to the peace clause decision, it may be appropriate to use an ex ante AMS-like approach to its decision during MY 1992 compared to the actual AMS for later marketing years.68 But even that decision would be expressed in "monetary terms".

84. Total expenditures for MY 1992 and total expenditures for marketing years during the implementation period are the only legitimate bases for the comparison required by Article 13(b)(ii) of the Agreement on Agriculture. All other calculation methods are either not supported by a Vienna Convention analysis of Article 13(b)(ii) (US rate of support approach; US rate of support approach as modified by Professor Sumner), or have major shortcomings that should lead them to be used them with extreme caution (budgetary outlays per unit). Brazil notes that its expenditure approach and the analogous AMS calculation yield identical results, if one were to account for deficiency payments in terms of expenditures rather than by using the formula approach offered by Annex 3, paragraph 10-11 of the Agreement on Agriculture.69
(d) Per unit rate of support for upland cotton (Prof. Sumner's approach at the first session of the first substantive meeting).
Brazil's Preliminary Comment on US Answer:
85. Brazil will further comment on any answer pursuant to the US promise to provide "a detailed critique of Mr. Sumner's analysis."70 As for the 11 August US comments, Brazil has earlier in its 22 August Comments to Questions 66(a) and (b) argued that Professor Sumner properly accounted for all US decisions.71 Concerning the inclusion of crop insurance subsidies, PFC and market loss assistance payments, as well as direct and counter-cyclical payments, Brazil has demonstrated in its Rebuttal Submission72 and in comments to Questions 38 and 43 that these domestic support measures constitute support to upland cotton as well as product-specific support. Thus, there is no basis to exclude these payments from any US calculation of upland cotton AMS.
(67) The Panel requests the parties to calculate and submit estimates of the AMS for upland cotton for marketing years 1992, 1999, 2000, 2001 and 2002. For this purpose the parties are each requested to submit AMS calculations for upland cotton (using the budgetary-outlay/nonprice gap methodology employed by the United States in respect of cotton in its DS Notifications (e.g., G/AG/N/USA/43) and using the formats and supporting tables in document G/AG/2) on the same basis as would be the case in calculating a product specific AMS for the purposes of the calculation of the "Total Current AMS" in any year in accordance with the relevant provisions, including as appropriate Article 1(a), (b) and (h), Article 6 and Annex 3 to the Agreement.
Brazil's Comment on US Answers:
86. The United States' calculation of upland cotton AMS is incomplete because it does not account for the product-specific support provided to upland cotton from PFC and market loss assistance payment, direct and counter-cyclical payments and crop insurance subsidies. Brazil has discussed the nature of these programs as product-specific (and as constituting "support to upland cotton") and the incorrect US interpretation of "product-specific" elsewhere.73 Brazil further notes that the United States has included in its calculation of upland cotton AMS storage payments and interest subsidies ­ product-specific support measures that the United States has not mentioned so far during this dispute.74 Based on this and other new data supplied by the United States, Brazil provides an update of its AMS calculation and of its analysis of total budgetary outlays.75

III. EXPORT CREDIT GUARANTEES
71 (a) Is an export credit guarantee a financial contribution in the form of a "potential direct transfer of funds or liabilities (e.g. loan guarantee)" within the meaning of Article 1.1(a)(1)(i) of the SCM Agreement? Why or why not? Does it confer a benefit within the meaning of Article 1.1(b)? Why or why not? If so, to whom?
(b) How, if at all, would these elements be relevant to the claims of Brazil, and the United States response thereto?
87. In responding to this Question, the United States relies solely on Article 10.2 of the Agreement on Agriculture and ­ alternatively ­ restricts the use of context from the SCM Agreement to item (j) only.76 Brazil addresses the United States' arguments regarding Article 10.2 of the Agreement on Agriculture at paragraphs 99-100 of its Rebuttal Submission. In determining what constitutes an export subsidy within the meaning of Article 10.1 of the Agreement on Agriculture, Brazil considers that the Panel should refer to Articles 1(e) and 10.1 of the Agreement on Agriculture itself, as well as to contextual guidance included in Articles 1 and 3 of the SCM Agreement, and in item (j) of the Illustrative List of Export Subsidies annexed to the SCM Agreement. This is consistent with the Appellate Body's decisions in US ­ FSC77 and Canada ­ Dairy.78
(73) The Panel could arguably take the view that Articles 1 and 3 of the SCM Agreement were relevant in assessing the WTO-consistency of United States export credit guarantees. The United States has yet to submit any evidence or argumentation on this point, either as potential context for interpretation of the terms in Article 10 of the Agreement on Agriculture or in relation to Brazil's claims under the SCM Agreement. The Panel would therefore appreciate United States views in respect of this situation, and invites the United States to submit relevant argumentation and evidence.
Brazil's Comment on US Answer:
88. The United States argues that it does not need to address Articles 1 and 3 of the SCM Agreement because it "does not believe that Brazil has submitted evidence and argumentation that would establish a prima facie case in favour of Brazil's claims . . ."79 Since the United States has surpassed its quantitative export quantity reduction commitment levels, Article 10.3 of the Agreement on Agriculture allocates the burden to the United States to prove that its excess exports did not benefit from export subsidies, including export credit guarantees.80 Therefore, it is not Brazil, but the United States, that is faced with satisfying the elements of a prima facie case in favour of its defence.
(74) If the Panel decides to refer to provisions of the SCM Agreement for contextual guidance in the interpretation of the terms in Article 10 of the Agreement on Agriculture, should the Panel refer to item (j) or Articles 1 and 3 of the SCM Agreement or both?

Brazil's Comment on US Answer:
89. In paragraph 141 of its 11 August Answer to Question 74 (and again in paragraphs 189 and 195 of its 11 August Answers to Questions 88(b) and (d), respectively), the United States asserts that "Brazil has not contested that challenged US export credit guarantee programs are within the scope of Article 10.2." The United States is incorrect. While it is possible that GSM 102, GSM 103 and SCGP export credit guarantees might be included in any international agreement that Members might some day reach in negotiations pursuant to Article 10.2 of the Agreement on Agriculture, no one knows at this stage what the scope of that agreement, if any, will be. The agreement might only cover export credits other than guarantees, like the OECD Arrangement on Guidelines for Officially Supported Export Credits, which does not cover export credit guarantees.
90. In any event, the relevant question is not whether export credit guarantees are "covered" by Article 10.2, but whether they are "exempted" by Article 10.2 from the general export subsidy disciplines of the Agreement on Agriculture. Brazil's position is that Article 10.2 does not exempt export credits like export credit guarantees from the general export subsidy disciplines of the Agreement on Agriculture, including Article 10.1 thereof. If those export credit guarantees constitute export subsidies, then they are subject to those disciplines. (In paragraph 142 of its 11 August Answer, the United States appears to concede this point, when it acknowledges that "[t]o determine the applicability of Article 10.1 to a particular measure not described in Article 9.1 first requires a determination whether a subsidy exists.")
(75) (identical to Third Party Question 32)
The Panel's attention has been drawn to Article 14(c) of the SCM Agreement (see third party submission of Canada) and to the panel report in DS 222 Canada- Export Credits and Loan Guarantees. How and to what extent are Article 14(c) of the SCM Agreement, and the cited panel report, relevant to the issue of whether or not the United States export credit guarantee programmes confer a "benefit"? What would the appropriate market benchmark be to use for any comparison? Please cite any other relevant material.
(Third Party Question 33)
What is the relevant (if any) of Brazil's statement that: " ... export credit guarantees for exports of agricultural products [sic] are not available on the marketplace by commercial lenders."
Brazil's Comment on EC Answers on Third Party Question 32 (identical to Question 75) and 33 and on US Answer to Question 75:
91. The United States argues that item (j) alone is relevant context for a determination whether CCC export credit guarantee programmes are export subsidies.81 The European Communities argues that the fact that a particular financing instrument offered by a government (such as CCC guarantees) is not available on the marketplace does not mean that such financing confers a benefit per se within the meaning of Article 1.1(b) of the SCM Agreement.82 The European Communities maintain that in circumstances in which a comparable type of financing is not available on the marketplace, an "alternative" benchmark such as item (j) has to be used for determining whether a benefit exists.83 While Brazil agrees with the European Communities that item (j) is an alternative test for the existence of an export subsidy, Brazil strongly disagrees that Article 1.1 of the SCM Agreement is ­ as the European Communities effectively and the United States explicitly argues ­ inapplicable in

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-158
such situations. Article 1.1 defines the existence of a subsidy for the purposes of the SCM Agreement and provides relevant context for the interpretation of the term "export subsidy" under the Agreement on Agriculture. Article 1.1(b) requires a comparison between what the recipient of a financial contribution received from the government and what the recipient could have received on the marketplace.84 The Appellate Body clarified that the standard under Article 1.1(b) is not the cost incurred by the government (as under item (j)).85 The relevant standard is the "benefit to the recipient" standard.
92. This definition of a subsidy cannot simply be read out of the SCM Agreement in a situation where there is no comparable commercial financing available. Nothing suggests that Article 1.1(b) is inapplicable in such a situation. The United States and the European Communities would certainly agree that a direct transfer of funds without consideration is not commercially available. In these circumstances, a benefit within the meaning of Article 1.1(b) of the SCM Agreement is conferred. A similar situation exists with respect to CCC guarantees. A recipient of CCC guarantees cannot receive a similar financial contribution on commercial terms, as no such financing is available on the marketplace.86 Thus, the CCC export credit guarantee programmes confer benefits. Brazil notes that the United States agreed, in its third party submission in Canada ­ Aircraft II, that where there is no comparable financial product on the market, a programme confers benefits per se.87
(76) How does the United States respond to Brazil's statement that : "...export credit guarantees for exports of agricultural exports [sic] are not available on the marketplace by commercial lenders."?
Brazil's Comment on US Answer:
93. The United States asserts that export credit insurance may be a comparable commercial product to CCC export credit guarantees.88 As noted in paragraph 103-104 of Brazil's Rebuttal Submission, the United States acknowledges that there are distinctions between insurance coverage and guarantees. Thus, the terms of insurance coverage by private, market-based financial institutions cannot serve as a benchmark against which to determine whether the CCC guarantee programmes confer "benefits," within the meaning of Article 1.1(b) of the SCM Agreement. As the United States has elsewhere noted, "[i]f the commercial market does not offer a particular borrower the exact terms offered by a government, then the government is providing a benefit to the recipient whenever those terms are more favourable than the terms that are available in the market."89 Moreover, the United States has not provided actual terms for insurance coverage by private, market-based financial institutions. Brazil understands that private, market-based insurance coverage for agricultural products is not available for periods extending nearly as long as periods provided by CCC guarantees.
(77) How does the United States interpretation of "long term operating costs and losses" in item (j) as claims paid give meaning to both "costs" and "losses"? Do claims paid represent "losses" or "costs" or both? If claims paid is represented by "losses", what would go into the "cost" element of item (j)? Could the United States expand on why it disagrees with the items which Brazil identifies for inclusion in the examination to be conducted under item (j)?

Brazil's Comment on US Answer:
94. In paragraph 145 of its response, the United States suggests that claims and defaults must exceed "revenue from whatever source it may be derived" to meet the elements of item (j), despite the fact that item (j) limits the revenue to be used to offset operating costs and losses to "premium rates". On the other hand, the United States maintains that it is only legitimate to account for claims and defaults in the context of item (j), and not for other operating costs and losses such as interest on debt to Treasury90, even though those sorts of other costs and losses are covered by the ordinary meaning of the terms included in item (j).91 This is incongruous, and not supported by the text of item (j).
95. Further, Brazil refers the Panel to its Rebuttal Submission and to its 22 August Comments to the US Answers to Question 81 below for a more detailed discussion on the elements that are to be included in an item (j) analysis.
(78) Can the United States provide supporting documentation for data used relating to "costs and losses" in paragraph 173? Could the United States confirm that the figures cited in paragraph 173 of its first written submission relate to the SCGP? Why did the United States cite these figures after stating that it is not possible to make any assessment of the long-term operating costs and losses of this programme?
Brazil's Comment on US Answer:
96. The United States has failed to provide the supporting documentation requested by the Panel. The data mentioned in paragraph 149 of the United States' 11 August Answer could have been provided for review and analysis by the Panel and Brazil. As a result, Brazil requests that the Panel reject the United States' assertions in paragraph 173 of the US First Submission.
(80) (identical to Third Party Question 35)
Did the drafters of the Agreement on Agriculture include export credit guarantees in Article 9.1 of the Agreement on Agriculture? Why of why not?
Brazil's Comment on EC Answer:
97. Brazil agrees with the European Communities that "Article 9.1 represents a list of export subsidies ... that are subject to reduction commitments."92 Export credit guarantees are not included, as they do not constitute per se export subsidies subject to reduction commitments. Only if export credit guarantees confer a benefit within the meaning of Article 1.1(b) and/or Article 14(c) of the SCM Agreement, or if they are provided at premium rates that are inadequate to cover the long-term operating costs and losses of the export credit guarantee programme, do they constitute export subsidies to be assessed against the export subsidy reduction commitments of a Member. In these circumstances, export credit guarantees must not be provided in a manner inconsistent with Article 10.1 of the Agreement on Agriculture.
98. Because export credit guarantees are not ­ under a Vienna Convention interpretation of Article 10.2 of the Agreement on Agriculture ­ excluded from the general export subsidy disciplines in AoA Article 10.1, their provision counts towards the export subsidy reduction commitments of a Member. Article 10.2 states that after agreement on disciplines governing the provision of export credits is reached, these credits can only be provided in conformity therewith. Brazil does not want to speculate on whether the internationally-agreed disciplines will subject export credit guarantees to

reduction commitments. In any event, under the current regime governing the provision of export credit guarantees, they are subject to the anti-circumvention disciplines in Article 10.1 of the Agreement on Agriculture and count towards a Member's export subsidy reduction commitments, if they constitute export subsidies within the meaning of the Agreement on Agriculture (and, by context, the SCM Agreement).
(81) How does the United States respond to the following in Brazil's oral statement
(a) paragraph 122 (rescheduled guarantees)
Brazil's Comment on US Answer:
99. Although "rescheduled amounts are counted as receivables, not losses," that does not mean that rescheduled amounts are actually collected, or even expected to be collected. CCC's 2002 financial statements demonstrate that many of CCC receivables are classified as "uncollectible" ­ in fact, $3.34 billion of total receivables of $6.93 billion are classified as "uncollectible."93 Moreover, as noted in Brazil's 11 August Comment on Question 77 (at paragraph 162), the US General Accounting Office has stated that historically, the majority of GSM support that is rescheduled is "in arrears".94 Based on this evidence, it is simply not accurate for the United States to argue, in paragraph 155 of its 11 August Answer, that "[t]he history of rescheduled Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) export credit guarantee claims over the long-term (the 10-year period 1993-2002) confirms" that "the United States does in fact collect on the rescheduling."
100. Brazil also notes that the United States has not provided any documentary evidence that would support its assertion.
(c) paragraphs 125 ff. (guaranteed loan subsidy)
Brazil's Comment on US Answer:
101. In paragraphs 108-110 of its Rebuttal Submission, Brazil summarizes the several bases on which the Panel can rest a finding that the GSM 102, GSM 103 and SCGP programmes constitute export subsidies under item (j). The United States criticizes one of those bases ­ the FCRA cost formula ­ as inappropriate because it allegedly relies on "estimated" rather than "actual" data about the costs of the programmes.95 This appears to be the United States' sole defence, which Brazil again notes applies only to the FCRA cost formula and not the other evidence and bases summarized by Brazil in paragraphs 108-110 of its Rebuttal Submission. In any event, Brazil rebuts the US arguments concerning "estimated" versus "actual" data in paragraphs 111-119 of its Rebuttal Submission, and asks the Panel to refer to Brazil's arguments therein.

102. Brazil notes that the United States has offered no documentation and data to support the figures included in paragraph 160 of its 11 August Answer. The Panel should not accept these unsupported assertions by the United States.
103. At paragraphs 122-123 of its 11 August Answer to Question 81(c), the United States asserts that "[a] cohort consists of all transactions associated with each type of guarantee issued during a particular year", and that "[n]ot until the cohort is closed can one make an assessment as to whether or not that particular cohort represents a cost to the Federal Government". Brazil notes that a "cohort" is not necessarily composed of all guarantees issued in a particular year. As the US Office of Management and Budget notes, cohorts may also be divided according to risk categories, with annual reestimates calculated according to those risk category-based cohorts.96 The United States in fact acknowledges at paragraph 148 of its 11 August Answer to Question 86 that "[a]ll countries eligible for any of the CCC export credit guarantee programmes are categorized according to risk".
(d) paragraphs 127-129 (re-estimates, etc.)
Brazil's Comment on US Answer:
104. In paragraph 163 of its 11 August Answer, the United States asserts that the "net total for all cohorts for guarantees issued since 1992 currently stands at a downward re-estimate of $1.9 billion", suggesting that by the time a cohort is closed and final data becomes available, the cohort becomes profitable. Although the United States offers no citation, the $1.9 billion lifetime reestimate figure appears to be taken from the Federal Credit Supplement attached to the 2004 US budget. As discussed further in paragraphs 115-117 of Brazil's Rebuttal Submission, however, the United States fails to note that when these total lifetime reestimates for all cohorts of guarantees disbursed since 1992 are netted against the total original subsidy estimates adopted each budget year during the period 1992-2002, the resulting loss is nearly $1.75 billion.
(b) paragraph 123 (interest on debt to Treasury)
Brazil's Comment on US Answer:
105. The United States' 11 August Answer addresses interest rate reestimates under the FCRA cost formula. Paragraph 123 of Brazil's Statement at the First Panel Meeting, however, to which the Panel's question refers, does not address the treatment of interest paid by the CCC to the Treasury Department under the FCRA cost formula. Rather, in paragraph 123 of its Oral Statement at the First Meeting of the Panel, Brazil was responding to the US assertion that Brazil's constructed formula for determining whether the CCC guarantee programmes' operating costs and losses outpaced premiums collected should not have included interest paid by the CCC to the Treasury Department. In paragraph 123 of its Oral Statement, Brazil argued that under the ordinary meaning of the term "operating costs", interest paid by the CCC to the Treasury Department should be included in an assessment of the programmes under item (j). Brazil's arguments have nothing to do with interest rate reestimates under the FCRA cost formula. The United States' answer is, therefore, only relevant in so far as the United States now seems to acknowledge that, for the purposes of Brazil's revised constructed formula, interest payments to Treasury are properly included.97

(e) Exhibits BRA-125-127
Brazil's Comment on US Answer:
106. The United States' 11 August Answer is incorrect. Reestimates are recorded in the "programme account" segment of the CCC guarantee programme budget, in line item 00.07 (interest on reestimates is recorded in line 00.08).98 Furthermore, Brazil has consistently also included the financing account in its exhibits, including ­ contrary to the US allegation99 ­ in Exhibit Bra-127.

Brazil's Comment on US Answer:
107. Brazil refers the Panel to paragraphs 111-119 of Brazil's Rebuttal Submission for discussion of the US arguments concerning "estimated" versus "actual" data.
(g) In respect of (a)-(f) above, how and to what extent do the information and data presented for the export guarantee programmes concerning "programme" and "financing", "summary of loan levels", "subsidy budget authority", "outlay levels", etc., in particular in Exhibits BRA-125-127, reflect "actual costs and losses" of the GSM-102, GSM-102 and SCGP export credit guarantee programmes(see e.g. Brazil's closing oral statement at the first session of the first substantive meeting, paragraph 24)?
Brazil's Comment on US Answer:
108. Brazil refers the Panel to paragraphs 111-119 of Brazil's Rebuttal Submission for discussion of the US arguments concerning "estimated" versus "actual" data.
(84) Is the Panel correct in understanding that, under the GSM-102 and GSM-103 programmes, the exporter pays a fee calculated on the dollar amount guaranteed, based on a schedule of rates applicable to different credit periods? How and on what basis are the fee rates fixed? Do the fee rates ever change? If so, how and for what reason? Would it be necessary to amend the legislation and/or regulations in order to adjust the fee rates?
Brazil's Comment on US Answer:
109. As noted in Brazil's 11 August Comment on Question 84 (at paragraphs 192-194), GSM 102 and GSM 103 fees are charged according to a fee schedule that does not account for the country risk involved or the credit rating of the borrower. The US Department of Agriculture's Office of the Inspector General noted in June 2001 that "the fees CCC charges for its GSM-102 and GSM-103 export credit guarantee programmes have not been changed in 7 years and may not be reflecting current costs".100 It repeated this statement in February 2002.101
98 See Exhibits Bra-88 to Bra-95 (US budgets for the years 1996-2003); Exhibits Bra-125 to Bra-127 (US budgets for the years 1994, 1995 and 2004). See also Exhibit Bra-184 (US budget for fiscal year 1993); Exhibit Bra-183 (US budget for fiscal year 1992).

110. Moreover, the US General Accounting Office ("GAO") analyzed CCC's failure to charge guarantee fees that take account of country risk or the creditworthiness of individual borrowers. Brazil quotes at length from the GAO study, since it provides further corroborating evidence that beneficiaries of CCC guarantees receive terms better than available on the market, and that CCC guarantee fees do not cover the costs of the CCC guarantee programmes:
Although GSM-102 recipient countries vary significantly from one another in terms of their risk of defaulting on GSM-102 loans, CCC does not adjust the fee that it charges for credit guarantees to take account of country risk. CCC fees are based upon the length of the credit period and the number of principal payments to be made. For example, for a 3-year GSM-102 loan with semiannual principal payments, CCC charges a fee of 55.6 cents per $100, or 0.56 per cent of the covered amount. For 3year loans with annual principal payments, the fee is 66.3 cents per $100.[ ] CCC fees that included a risk-based component might not cover all of the country risk, but they could help to offset the cost of loan defaults.
USDA officials told us that including a fee for country risk could reduce the competitiveness of GSM-102 exports. However, they said they did not have recent or current data to support their claim.
The US Export-Import Bank, which provides credit guarantees to promote a variety of US exports, uses risk-based fees to defray the cost of defaults on its portfolio. Under its system, each borrower/guarantor is rated in one of eight country risk categories. Exposure fees vary based on both the level of assessed risk and the length of time provided for repayment. For example, in the case of repayment over 3 years, a country rated in the lowest risk category is charged a fee of 75 cents per $100, whereas a country in the highest risk category is charged a fee of $5.70 per $100 of coverage. Thus, the bank's fee structure includes a substantial added charge for high country risk. According to the bank, its system is designed to remain as competitive as possible with fees charged by official export credit agencies of other countries.
Under section 211(b)(1)(b) of the 1990 Farm Bill, CCC is currently restricted from charging an origination fee for any GSM-102 credit guarantee in excess of an amount equal to 1 per cent of the amount of credit extended under the transaction.[102] This restriction was initially enacted in 1985 following proposed administration legislation to charge a 5-per cent user fee for exports backed with credit guarantees. Some Members of Congress were concerned that such a fee would adversely affect the competitiveness of GSM-102 exports. Under the 1-per cent restriction, CCC would be considerably limited in the size of the fee that it could charge to take account of country risk should it decide to do so. For example, as previously noted, CCC charges 0.56 per cent for a loan payable in 3 years and with principal payments due annually. The most it could increase the fee would be 0.44 per cent. In contrast, the Export-Import Bank currently charges fees as high as 5.7 per cent for 3-year loans.103

111. Brazil notes that CCC fees for GSM 102 have not changed materially since the GAO published its report in 1995.104 Moreover, the United States confirmed in its 11 August Answer to Question 84 (at paragraph 180) that US law prohibits CCC from charging fees in excess of one per cent of the guaranteed dollar value of the transaction.
(85) Is the Panel correct in understanding that, under the SCGP, the exporter pays a fee for the guarantee calculated on the guaranteed portion of the value of the export sales? How and on what basis are the fee rates fixed? Do the fee rates ever change? If so, how and for what reason? Would it be necessary to amend the legislation and/or regulations in order to adjust the fee rates? Please explain any "risk" assessment involved in the programme.
Brazil's Comment on US Answer:
112. As noted in Brazil's 11 August Comment on Question 85 (at paragraph 195), SCGP fees do not vary according to the country risk involved or the credit rating of the borrower. With or without the "risk sharing" described in paragraph 183 of the United States' 11 August Answer, Brazil notes the United States' acknowledgement that "CCC does not determine the creditworthiness of importers participating in the SCGP."105 This presents further corroborating evidence that beneficiaries of CCC guarantees receive terms better than available on the market, and that CCC guarantee fees do not cover the costs of the CCC guarantee programmes.
(86) Is there a risk categorization in relation to three export credit guarantee programmes (GSM-102, GSM-103 and SCGP)? Does this have any impact on premiums payable and the ability of the CCC to on-sell the guarantees ?
Brazil's Comment on US Answer:
113. Brazil notes the United States' acknowledgement that "[a] country's risk classification has no impact on the premiums payable under the US export credit guarantee programmes". CCC's failure to account for country risk provides further corroborating evidence that beneficiaries of CCC guarantees receive terms better than available on the market, and that CCC guarantee fees do not cover the costs of the CCC guarantee programmes.
(87) What proportion of CCC (export-related and total) long term operating costs and losses are represented by GSM-102, GSM-103 and SCGP programmes?
Brazil's Comment on US Answer:
114. The United States asserts that funding for the CCC export guarantee programs is provided from the US Treasury, and is not "financed out of" the CCC. This suggests that the CCC export guarantee programs are not self-sustaining. This suggests in turn that the CCC export guarantee programmes meet the elements of item (j) and, thus, constitute export subsidies.
(88a) Is the Panel correct in understanding that the United States' argument is that, at present, by virtue of Article 10.2 of the Agreement on Agriculture, there are no disciplines on agricultural export credit guarantees under the Agreement on Agriculture (or the SCM Agreement)?
Article 1.1(b) of the SCM Agreement, Brazil offers this example to demonstrate that the CCC guarantee programs do not even meet non-market benchmarks.

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-165
Brazil's Comment on US Answer:
115. The United States incorrectly argues, in paragraph 187 of its 11 August Answer, that "[i]f export credit guarantee programmes were already subject to export subsidy disciplines, then Article 10.2 would be unnecessary." The negotiators may have considered it useful to negotiate additional disciplines for export credit guarantees one day, but that does not mean that they intended for export credits to be exempted from the general disciplines of the Agreement on Agriculture while those negotiations were pending.
116. The United States also argues in paragraph 187 that Brazil's use of the term "specific" disciplines somehow defeats Brazil's interpretation of Article 10.2. Brazil uses the term "specific" disciplines merely as a way of distinguishing between one actual and one potential category of export subsidy disciplines under the Agreement on Agriculture: (i) those "general" disciplines that apply to export credit guarantees today; and (ii) those "specific" disciplines that would additionally apply to export credits upon the completion of the negotiations called for by Article 10.2.
(b) Does the United States agree with the following proposition: a WTO Member may therefore extend agricultural export credit guarantees without charging a premium, and for an indefinite period, in addition to any other terms and conditions it may wish? How would this reconcile with the title of Article 10 of the Agreement on Agriculture ("Prevention of Circumvention on Export Subsidy Commitments"), and with other commitments contained in the Agreement on Agriculture? Please cite any relevant material, including any past WTO dispute settlement cases. How would this reconcile with the United States' own statement, at paragraph 21 of its closing oral statement that "of course, the United States may not provide subsidies without any limit".
Brazil's Comment on US Answer:
117. Please see Brazil's 22 August Comment on the United States' 11 August Answer to Question 74 for observations on the United States' assertion, in paragraph 189, that "Brazil has not contested that US export credit guarantee programmes are encompassed by the terms of Article 10.2."
118. The United States argues that an interpretation of Article 10.2 of the Agreement on Agriculture that exempts export credits from the general export subsidy disciplines of that agreement is consistent with the title of Article 10 ­ "Prevention of Circumvention of Export Subsidy Commitments."106 The United States' argument is absurd. Since negotiations on specific disciplines pursuant to Article 10.2 have not been concluded, the United States' interpretation of Article 10.2 would leave export credit support completely undisciplined, and open to the abuse outlined in the text of the Panel's question. In this way, the United States' interpretation of Article 10.2 facilitates, rather than prevents, circumvention of its export subsidy commitments.
119. The United States also argues that the portion of Article 10.2 calling for Members to work toward the negotiation of specific disciplines on export credits also contributes to the prevention of circumvention. As the ordinary meaning of the first portion of Article 10.2 demonstrates, however107, Members are not even required to actually negotiate specific disciplines for export credits, let alone to reach actual agreement on those specific disciplines. All Members have agreed to do is to work toward the development of those specific disciplines, which does not in itself prevent circumvention.
(c) If, as the United States argues, there are no disciplines on export credit guarantees in the Agreement on Agriculture, how could export credit guarantees

"conform fully to the provisions of Part V" of the Agreement on Agriculture within the meaning of Article 13 (how can you assess "conformity" or nonconformity when there are allegedly no disciplines against which such an assessment could occur)?
Brazil's Comment on US Answer:
120. The United States argues that since export credit guarantees are not subject to export subsidy disciplines in the Agreement on Agriculture, they "cannot be out of compliance with Part V" of the that agreement. The pertinent question is whether export credit guarantees can, under the terms of Article 13(c), "conform fully to the provisions of Part V" of the Agreement on Agriculture. In this regard, the United States ignores the conclusions of the panel in Canada ­ Aircraft (21.5).108 As noted in Brazil's 11 August Comment on Question 88(c) (paragraphs 200-202), if the United States is correct that CCC export credit guarantees are not subject to the disciplines in Part V of the Agreement on Agriculture, then CCC guarantees cannot logically "conform fully to the provisions of Part V" and trigger the exemption from action provided for in Article 13(c).
121. Alternatively, the United States suggests that Article 13(c) does not apply to export credit guarantees because "export credit guarantees are not export subsidies within the meaning of either Article 9.1 or 10.1" of the Agreement on Agriculture. This assertion is not supported by the United States with any reference to the tools of interpretation included in the Vienna Convention, and is fundamentally incorrect. Brazil has demonstrated that the GSM 102, GSM 103 and SCGP export credit guarantee programs administered by the CCC constitute export subsidies within the meaning of Articles 10.1, 1(e) and 8 of the Agriculture Agreement, Article 3.1(a) of the SCM Agreement, and item (j) of the Illustrative List of Export Subsidies attached as Annex I to the SCM Agreement.109
(d) Is the United States advocating the view that its own export credit guarantee programmes, which pre-dated the Uruguay Round, are effectively "grandfathered" so as to benefit from some sort of exemption from the export subsidy disciplines of the Agreement on Agriculture? How, if at all, is it relevant that the SCGP did not, according to the United States, become relevant for upland cotton until the late 1990's (i.e. after the entry into force of the WTO Agreement)?
Brazil's Comment on US Answer:
122. Please see Brazil's comment on the United States' 11 August Answer to Question 74 for observations on the US assertion in paragraph 189 that "Brazil has not contested that SCGP provides export credit guarantees within the meaning of Article 10.2."
IV. STEP 2 PAYMENTS
(92) Does the United States confirm that Exhibit Bra.65 represents a sample contract for exporters of eligible upland cotton to conclude with the CCC under the FSRI 2002, and that an application form (Exhibit Bra-66) needs to be filled out with data on weekly exports and submitted to the USDA FAS. Is Exhibit Bra-66- Form CCC 1045-2 also a valid example? If not, please identify any differences or distinctions.
(96) Is a domestic sale a "use" for the purposes of Step 2 payments? Is a sale for export, or export, considered a "use"?

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-167
Brazil's Comments to the US Answers:
123. Brazil notes that the Step 2 regulations make a clear distinction between "domestic users" and "exporters".110 "Domestic users" may only receive payment upon "proof of purchase and consumption of eligible cotton by the domestic user. . .".111 The agreement for domestic users provides that a domestic user is a person regularly engaged in manufacturing eligible upland cotton into cotton products in the United States and that "in the event that the cotton is not used for that purpose, the payment received shall be returned immediately and with interest".112 There is no requirement that "exporters" prove, prior to receiving payment, that exported US upland cotton be "used" for anything upon export. Rather, the payment is a function of "proof of export of eligible cotton by the exporter".113 Thus, the structure of the Step 2 programme clearly differentiates between "export" and "use". Article 3.1(b) applies the phrase "contingent upon use." Article 3.1(a) uses the phrase "contingent . . . upon export performance".
124. In relation to Exhibit US-21, Brazil agrees with the United States that the two different forms that have to be annexed to the User/Exporter Agreement have different objectives depending on the final destination of upland cotton. That is, if the upland cotton is used domestically, then the CCC1045UP-1 form has to be completed and annexed to the User/Exporter Agreement. If the cotton is exported, then the CCC-1045UP-2 form has to be used. However, contrary to the US statement at paragraph 201 of its 11 August Answer to Question 92, the latter makes no reference whatsoever to an "Exporter User." Indeed, the term "exporter user" is not contained either in the Step 2 regulations nor in the form that has to be annexed to the User/Exporter Agreement if the upland cotton will be exported. This is consistent with the fact that an exporter is not a "user" under the Step 2 programme and the act of exporting is unlikely a final "use" of upland cotton. In sum, Step 2 export payments are not made contingent upon "use," but contingent upon "export".
(93) Please elaborate why the United States deems that Step 2 payments upon submission of proof of export are not subsidies contingent upon export. Is it the US contention that, in order to be contingent on export, exportation must be the exclusive condition for receipt of the payment?
(99) How does the United States respond to Brazil's arguments in paragraphs 71-75 of Brazil's Oral Statement at the first session of the first panel meeting concerning the relevance of the Appellate body Report in US- FSC(21.5)
Brazil's Comment on US Answers:
125. The United States in its 11 August Answer to Question 93 states at paragraph 202 that "all upland cotton produced in the United States is eligible for the benefit of the Step 2 cotton subsidy".114 Furthermore, it submits that "when the entirety of production of a good in a country is eligible to receive a subsidy, no contingency on export exists".115
126. Brazil provides a detailed comment to these assertions in its Rebuttal Submission.116 In fact, Step 2 payments are not made to every pound of upland cotton that is "used". Rather, Step 2 payments are made on every pound of upland cotton that is exported by eligible exporters or that is
110 Exhibit Bra-37 (7 CFR 1427.104) 111 Exhibit Bra-37 (7 CFR 1427.108(d)). 112 Exhibit US-21 (Upland Cotton Domestic User / Exporter Agreement, Section, Section B1) 113 Exhibit Bra-37 (7 CFR 1427.108(d)) 114 US 11 August Answer to Question 93, para. 202. 115 US 11 August Answer to Question 93, para. 202. 116 See Rebuttal Submission of Brazil, paras. 129-130.

WT/DS267/R/Add.2 Page I-168
used by eligible domestic users. No Step 2 payment is made for upland cotton exported or used by ineligible persons, or for upland cotton that is neither used domestically nor exported, but that is for instance stored, stolen or incidentally destroyed by for example fire.
127. Furthermore, the criterion whether Step 2 payments are available to all upland cotton produced in the United States is entirely irrelevant for Brazil's claims under Article 3 of the SCM Agreement. That provision prohibits the payment of subsidies that are contingent upon export or contingent upon the use of domestic over imported goods. It follows that a subsidy is prohibited if its payment is conditional on the existence of one of the two situations: export or use of local content.
(107) At paragraph 135 of its first written submission, the United States states: "The subsidy is not contingent upon export performance..."(emphasis added). Again, in the course of the first Panel meeting, the United States admitted that the Step 2 payments were "subsidies". Does the United States thus concede that Step2 payments constitute a "subsidy" within the meaning of the WTO Agreement?
Brazil's Comment on US Answer:
128. The arguments provided by the United States are not responsive to the question posed by the Panel. Brazil reiterates that Exhibit Bra-69 is not relevant for its de jure claims. Whenever a Step 2 payment for exported or domestically used upland cotton takes place, the payment is made inconsistently with Articles 3.1(a) or 3.1(b) of the SCM Agreement and with Articles 3.3 and 8 of the Agreement of Agriculture in the case of Step 2 export payments. Step 2 export payments are contingent upon export performance and Step 2 domestic payments are contingent upon use of domestic over imported upland cotton. Neither the respective share of Step 2 export and domestic payments nor the share of eligible US upland cotton production materially affects this conclusion.
(111) Does the United States maintain its argument that actions based on Article 3.1(b) of the SCM Agreement are conditionally « exempt from actions » due to the operation of Article 13 of the Agreement on Agriculture?
(112) In the event that the Panel finds that Article 6.3 of the Agreement on Agriculture does not preclude an examination of Brazil's claims under Article 3.1 of the SCM Agreement and Article III:4 of GATT 1994, how does the United States respond to the merits of Brazil's claims relating to Step 2 payments under those provisions?
(113) Is it necessary for measures directed at agricultural processors included in AMS to discriminate on the basis of the origin of goods?
(115) What is the meaning and relevance (if any) to Brazil's claims under Article 3 of the SCM Agreement and Article III:4 of GATT 1994 of the phrase "measures directed at agricultural processors shall be included to the extent that such measures benefit the producers of the basic agricultural products" in the Agreement on Agriculture?
(116) With respect to paragraph 32 of the oral statement of the EC, are subsidies contingent on the use of domestic goods consistent with the Agreement on Agriculture? Does the phrase "provide support in favour of domestic producers" in Article 3.2 of the Agreement on Agriculture refer to, and/or permit such subsidies?
Brazil's Comment to the US Answers:
129. Brazil addresses the US 11 August Answers to the questions listed above in its Rebuttal Submission at paragraphs 131-144. Brazil further refers the Panel to paragraphs 78-86 of its Oral Statement and to its 11 August Answers to Questions 100-102 and 115-116.
