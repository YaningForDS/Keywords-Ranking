UNITED STATES ­ MEASURES AFFECTING TRADE IN LARGE CIVIL AIRCRAFT
Request for the Establishment of a Panel by the European Communities
The following communication, dated 20 January 2006, from the delegation of the European Communities to the Chairman of the Dispute Settlement Body, is circulated pursuant to Article 6.2 of the DSU.
_______________
On 6 October 2004 the European Communities ("EC") requested consultations in the above matter with the United States ("US") pursuant to Articles 4.1, 7.1, and 30 of the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures ("SCM Agreement"), Article XXIII:1 of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994 ("GATT 1994"), and Article 4 of the Understanding on Rules and Procedures Governing the Settlement of Disputes ("DSU").1 Consultations were held on 5 November 2004 but failed to resolve the dispute.
At the meeting of the Dispute Settlement Body ("DSB") on 13 June concerning the request for establishment of the panel in the above case2 the US asserted without any explanation that 13 of the 28 subsidy programs referenced in the panel request were not listed in the consultation request of 6 October 2004 and could not be the subject of panel proceedings. The EC did not agree with this unfounded contention but expressed its readiness to continue consultations in order to clarify and resolve the issues, it being understood that this was without prejudice to the EC's legal position and rights. Accordingly, the EC on 27 June 2005 requested a continuation of the consultations held on 5 November 2004.3
The requested continued consultations were held on 3 August 2005 but failed to resolve the dispute.
Regrettably, the US decided to use its unfounded procedural objections further to undermine the Annex V proceeding initiated in this matter by the DSB on 23 September 2005. In particular, the US decided not to provide answers on measures that the US unilaterally determined to be outside the scope of the dispute. In addition, the US repeatedly blocked endeavours by the EC to have the Panel rule authoritatively on the scope of the dispute.
As a result, the EC has been deprived of its rights under the SCM Agreement to obtain the necessary information with respect to approximately half of the measures involved. This has seriously undermined the due process rights of the EC and its ability to prepare its case against the US.
1 Circulated as document WT/DS317/1 on 12 October 2004. 2 Circulated as document WT/DS317/2 on 3 June 2005. 3 Circulated as document WT/DS317/1/Add.1 on 1 July 2005.

WT/DS317/5 Page 2
To resolve this situation, the EC, in good faith and in an effort to resolve the dispute efficiently, hereby requests that a panel be established pursuant to Article 6 of the DSU; Article XXIII:2 of GATT 1994; and Articles 4, 7, and 30 of the SCM Agreement (to the extent that Article 30 incorporates by reference Article XXIII of GATT 1994) to consider the matter described below. This request is without prejudice to the EC's position that all the measures described below are already properly before the Panel that was established on 20 July 2005. The EC has already contacted the US in order to discuss how most efficiently to follow up on this request in the light of the developments described above and is prepared to continue these discussions with a view to ensuring a prompt and positive solution to this dispute.
*******
This dispute concerns prohibited and actionable subsidies provided to and benefiting the US producers of large civil aircraft4 (the "US LCA industry"), including, in particular, the Boeing Company ("Boeing") and McDonnell Douglas Corporation prior to its merger with Boeing. The measures are currently reflected in and derive from the following:

· Project 90-01-0126 (Solid-State Laser Technology for Point Source X-Ray Lithography);
· Project 95-02-0036 (Plasma-Based Processing of Lightweight Materials for MotorVehicle Components and Manufacturing Applications).
5. US Department of Labor
The US Department of Labor transfers economic resources to the US LCA industry on terms more favourable than available on the market or not at arm's length, through the Aerospace Industry Initiative, an element of the President's High Growth Training Initiative, under the authority of the Workforce Investment Act, Pub. L. No. 105-220 (1998), by granting to Edmonds Community College in the State of Washington funds for the training of aerospace industry workers associated with the Boeing 787.
6. Federal tax incentives
The US Government transfers economic resources to the US LCA industry through the federal tax system, and in particular through the following tax measures:
a. Sections 921-927 of the Internal Revenue Code (prior to repeal) and related measures establishing special tax treatment for "Foreign Sales Corporations" ("FSCs");
b. FSC Repeal and Extraterritorial Income Exclusion Act of 2000, Pub. L. No. 106-519; and
c. American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, Pub. L. No. 108-357.

The European Communities considers that the above measures are inconsistent with the obligations of the US under the following provisions:
(1) Articles 3.1(a), 3.1(b) and 3.2 of the SCM Agreement;
(2) Article 5(a) of the SCM Agreement;

WT/DS317/5 Page 13
(3) Articles 5(c), 6.3(a), 6.3(b) and 6.3(c) of the SCM Agreement;
(4) Article III:4 of the GATT 1994.
The European Communities is of the view that the above measures, reflected in the US, State, and local statutes, regulations, administrative procedures, and other programmes and policies as listed above, including any relevant subsequent amendments thereof or successory acts, are inconsistent with these provisions as such and as applied.
The measures listed above are subsidies because in each instance there is a financial contribution by the US, State or local government, and a benefit is thereby conferred within the meaning of Article 1.1(a)(1) and (b) of the SCM Agreement. They benefit and will continue to benefit in the future the development, production, sale, and export of each of the individual subsidised LCA products of the US LCA industry. Each of the listed subsidies is specific to the US LCA industry within the meaning of Article 2 of the SCM Agreement.
The subsidies listed above are de jure or de facto export contingent, and contingent on the use of domestic over imported goods.
The use of these measures causes adverse effects ­ i.e., material injury or threat of material injury to the European Community LCA industry ­ and serious prejudice including threat of serious prejudice to the interests of the European Communities within the meaning of Article 5(a) and (c) of the SCM Agreement, because, inter alia:
­ The effect of the measures is material injury, or a threat thereof, in violation of Article 5(a) of the SCM Agreement;
­ The effect of the measures is a significant price undercutting by subsidised products of the US LCA industry as compared with the price of competing European Community LCA products in the world, European Community, US, and third country markets where US and Community producers compete, or a threat thereof, in violation of Articles 5(c) and 6.3(c) of the SCM Agreement;
­ The effect of the measures is significant depression and suppression of the prices of competing European Community LCA products in the world, European Community, US, and third country markets where US and Community producers compete, or a threat thereof, in violation of Articles 5(c) and 6.3(c) of the SCM Agreement;
­ The effect of the measures is significant lost sales of competing European Community LCA products in the world, European Community, US, and third country markets where US and Community producers compete, or a threat thereof, in violation of Articles 5(c) and 6.3(c) of the SCM Agreement;
­ The effect of the measures is to displace or impede exports of competing European Community LCA products in the US market, or a threat thereof, in violation of Articles 5(c) and 6.3(a) of the SCM Agreement;
­ The effect of the measures is to displace or impede exports of competing European Community LCA products in third country markets, or a threat thereof, in violation of Articles 5(c) and 6.3(b) of the SCM Agreement.

The above measures are neither justified under any provision of a covered agreement, including the Agreement on Trade in Civil Aircraft, nor under the 1992 Agreement between the European Communities and the Government of the United States of America concerning the application of the GATT Agreement on Trade in Civil Aircraft on trade in large civil aircraft.
The European Communities requests that a panel be established with standard terms of reference, in accordance with Articles 4.4 and 7.4 of the SCM Agreement and Article 7 of the DSU.
The European Communities asks that a special meeting of the Dispute Settlement Body be convened on Thursday 2 February 2006 and that this request for the establishment of a panel be placed on the agenda of that meeting.
Finally, the European Communities requests that the DSB, together with the establishment of the panel, initiate the procedures for developing information concerning serious prejudice under Annex V of the SCM Agreement. This request is without prejudice to the EC's position that all the measures described above are already properly before the Panel that was established on 20 July 2005 and therefore were covered by the Annex V proceeding initiated by the DSB on 23 September 2005. The EC is prepared to discuss together with the Representative designated by the DSB to serve the function of facilitating the information-gathering process, pursuant to paragraph 4 of Annex V of the SCM Agreement, Mr. Mateo Diego-Fernandez, and with the US, how the Annex V process can be pursued most efficiently.
