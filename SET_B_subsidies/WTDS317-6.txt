UNITED STATES ­ MEASURES AFFECTING TRADE IN LARGE CIVIL AIRCRAFT
Communication from the Chairman of the Panel
The following communication, dated 13 April 2006, addressed to the Chairman of the Dispute Settlement Body (DSB), is circulated in accordance with Article 12.9 of the Dispute Settlement Understanding (DSU).
_______________
Article 12.8 of the Understanding on Rules and Procedures Governing the Settlement of Disputes (DSU) provides that the period in which a panel shall conduct its examination, from the date that the composition and terms of reference of the panel have been agreed upon until the date the final report is issued to the parties to the dispute, shall, as a general rule, not exceed six months.
Article 12.9 of the DSU provides that, when a panel considers that it cannot issue its report within six months, it shall inform the Dispute Settlement Body (DSB) in writing of the reasons for the delay, together with an estimate of the period within which it will issue its report.
The Panel on United States ­ Measures Affecting Trade in Large Civil Aircraft (WT/DS317) was established by the DSB on 20 July 2005 and composed on 17 October 2005.
It will not be possible for the Panel to complete its work in six months in light of the substantive and procedural complexities involved in this dispute, including the process of developing information concerning serious prejudice under Annex V of the SCM Agreement, the establishment of a second Panel at the request of the European Communities1 on 17 February 2006, and the Panel's subsequent agreement, at the parties' request, to set aside the original timetable for the dispute until an unspecified date in the future.
The Panel expects to complete its work in 2007.
