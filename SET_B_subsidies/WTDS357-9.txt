Pursuant to paragraph 11 of Article 4 of the Understanding on Rules and Procedures Governing the Settlement of Disputes (DSU), Thailand hereby notifies the consulting parties and the Dispute Settlement Body of its desire to be joined in the consultations requested by Canada in a communication circulated to WTO Members on 11 January 2007 (WT/DS357/1).
As a leading exporter of one of the agricultural products affected by the measures at issue, Thailand has a substantial and systemic interest in the subject of Canada's consultations request. Hence, Thailand requests to be joined in the consultations requested by Canada in this matter.
I look forward to receiving confirmation of receipt and acceptance of this request, and advice regarding the timing and venue for these consultations.
